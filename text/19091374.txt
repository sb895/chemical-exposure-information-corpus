Environmental policies in Mexico have contributed to the reduction in the production or use of some persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) and metals .
However , monitoring of POPs concentrations in humans living in hot spots is lacking .
Therefore , the objective of this study was to conduct a screening for POPs and metals first in Mexican children living in high-risk areas .
During the year 2004 , we analyzed a total of 229 healthy children ( aged 6-12 years old ) who resided in communities located in nine Mexican states .
Organochlorine insecticides , PCBs and metals were quantified in plasma and urine samples .
We detected p'p-DDE in all the children ; moreover , p'p-DDT , lindane and hexachlorobenzene were detected respectively in 14% , 85% and 10% of the children studied .
Measurable levels of PCBs were recorded in only one community , where six of 14 PCB congeners assayed were detected ( numbers 52 , 118 , 138 , 153 , 170 and 180 ) .
All the children had detectable levels of lead in their blood ( mean level , 4.6 microg dL(-1) ) ; furthermore , 57% of the children studied had levels higher than 5.0 microg/dL .
The mean level of urinary arsenic ( UAs ) for all the children was 22.35 microg g(-1) creatinine and 15% of those children had concentrations of UAs above 50 microg g(-1) creatinine .
For cadmium , the mean urinary level was 0.78 microg g(-1) creatinine , and only one percent of the children had values above 2.0 microg g(-1) creatinine .
The results cannot be generalized since the communities selected are not representative of the Mexican population ; however , they indicate that Mexican children are exposed to chemicals and some at risk levels .
