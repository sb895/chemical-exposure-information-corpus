The main purpose of this study was to assess environmental contamination by arsenic and cadmium in a smelter community ( San Luis Potosí City , México ) and its possible contribution to an increased body burden of these elements in children .
Arsenic and cadmium were found in the environment ( air , soil , and household dust , and tap water ) as well as in the urine and hair from children .
The study was undertaken in three zones : Morales , an urban area close to the smelter complex ; Graciano , an urban area 7 km away from the complex ; and Mexquitic , a small rural town 25 km away .
The environmental study showed that Morales is the most contaminated of the zones studied .
The range of arsenic levels in soil ( 117-1396 ppm ) , dust ( 515-2625 ppm ) , and air ( 0.13-1.45 micrograms/m3 ) in the exposed area ( Morales ) was higher than those in the control areas .
Cadmium concentrations were also higher in Morales .
Estimates of the arsenic ingestion rate in Morales ( 1.0-19.8 micrograms/kg/day ) were equal to or higher than the reference dose of 1 microgram/kg/day calculated by the Environmental Protection Agency .
The range of arsenic levels in urine ( 69-594 micrograms/g creatinine ) and hair ( 1.4-57.3 micrograms/g ) and that of cadmium in hair ( 0.25-3.5 micrograms/g ) indicated that environmental exposure has resulted in an increased body burden of these elements in children , suggesting that children living in Morales are at high risk of suffering adverse health effects if exposure continues .
