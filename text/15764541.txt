The destruction of the World Trade Center ( WTC ) in New York City on September 11 , 2001 , created a 16-acre debris field composed of pulverized and burning material significantly impacting air quality .
Site cleanup began almost immediately .
Cleanup workers were potentially exposed to airborne contaminants , including particulate matter , volatile organic compounds , and asbestos , at elevated concentrations .
This article presents the results of the exposure assessment of one important group of WTC workers , truck drivers , as well as area monitoring that was conducted directly on site during October 2001 and April 2002 .
In cooperation with a local labor union , 54 drivers ( October ) and 15 drivers ( April ) were recruited on site to wear two monitors during their 12-hour work shifts .
In addition , drivers were administered a questionnaire asking for information ranging from " first day at the site " to respirator use .
Area monitoring was conducted at four perimeter locations during October and three perimeter locations during April .
During both months , monitoring was also conducted at one location in the middle of the rubble .
Contaminants monitored for included total dust ( TD ) , PM10 , PM2.5 , and volatile organic compounds .
Particle samples were analyzed for mass , as well as elemental and organic carbon content .
During October , the median personal exposure to TD was 346 microg/m3 .
The maximum area concentration , 1742 microg/m3 , was found in middle of the debris .
The maximum TD concentration found at the perimeter was 392 microg/m3 implying a strong concentration gradient from the middle of debris outward .
PM2.5/PM10 ratios ranged from 23% to 100% suggesting significant fire activity during some of the sampled shifts .
During April , the median personal exposure to TD was 144 microg/m3 , and the highest area concentration , 195 microg/m3 , was found at the perimeter .
During both months , volatile organic compounds concentrations were low .
