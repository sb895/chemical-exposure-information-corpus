Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are a mixture of 209 possible congeners with different chlorine substitutions and they are potentially hazardous compounds in the environment for human beings .
The high lipophilicity and the resistance to biodegradation of PCBs allow the bioaccumulation of these chemicals in the fatty tissues of organisms .
The objective of this study was to determine the levels of PCBs in the adipose tissue of women living in Ankara , Turkey .
For this purpose , levels of seven major persistent PCB congeners ( IUPAC Numbers : 28 , 52 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 , 180 ) were measured in 29 primiparous mothers ' adipose tissue samples by gas chromatography with electron capture detection ( GC-ECD ) .
PCB IUPAC numbers 138 , 153 and 180 were the most abundant congeners , each accounting for > 20% of the total PCB content of adipose tissue .
PCB 153 was the dominant congener in all the samples ( 141.7 +/- 132.3 ng/g lipid wt. basis ) .
The results are compared with the similar studies from other countries .
The concentrations of PCB 28 , PCB 52 and PCB 101 were found to be higher than those found in industrialized countries .
This study is important in terms of being the first study of determination of PCB levels in adipose tissue samples in Turkey .
