Very few studies have reported on the occurrence and accumulation profiles of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) and synthetic musk compounds ( SMCs ) in human adipose tissue .
In this study , concentrations of PAHs and SMCs in adipose tissues collected from Korean women in 2007 and 2008 were determined .
Total concentrations of PAHs and SMCs in adipose tissues ranged from 15 to 361 ( mean : 119 ) ngg(-1) lipid weight and from 38 to 253 ( mean : 106 ) ngg(-1) lipid weight , respectively .
Concentrations of SMCs in Korean adipose tissues were lower than those reported for European countries and the United States .
Naphthalene was the most predominant PAH and HHCB was the dominant SMC found in adipose tissues .
The concentrations of PAHs and SMCs were not correlated with each other , suggesting that the sources of human exposure to these two classes of compounds are different .
No correlation was found between donor's age and residue levels of PAHs and SMCs .
The results of this study provide baseline information on exposure of PAHs and SMCs to the general population in Korea .
