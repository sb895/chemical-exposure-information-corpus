Perfluoroalkyl chemicals ( PFCs ) have been used as surfactants and stain repellants in a variety of consumer products for more than 50years and there is growing concern regarding their persistence and toxicity .
Human exposure to these chemicals is essentially universal in North America and researchers have linked them to a variety of health problems ranging from higher rates of cancer , to developmental and reproductive problems , and higher cholesterol levels .
Major exposure pathways are food and water ingestion , dust ingestion via hand to mouth transfer .
In an effort to assess residential exposure , the Wisconsin Department of Health Services tested vacuum cleaner contents from thirty-nine homes for 16 perflouroalkyl chemicals .
PFOS , PFOA , PFHxS , PFHpA and PFNA were found in all of the vacuum dust samples and dust from eight homes contained all 16 PFCs included in our analysis .
The most commonly detected compounds were perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) , perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) which together made up 70% of the total PFC residues in dust from these homes .
Summed PFC concentrations in these dust samples ranged from 70 to 2513ng/g ( median 280ng/g ) .
Our investigation suggests that these chemicals may be ubiquitous contaminants in US homes .
