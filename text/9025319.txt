Elemental analysis of scalp hair of locomotive shed workers and industrial welders was used to study occupational exposure .
Instrumental neutron activation analysis ( INAA ) was used for the determination of 17 elements , Ba , Br , Ca , Co , Cr , Cu , Fe , Hg , K , Mn , Na , P , Sb , Sc , Se , Th and Zn .
Most elements show normal distribution at 95% confidence level .
Further statistical significance was tested by correlation coefficient and regression coefficients ( r2 ) .
Comparison of mean elemental contents of the subjects with controls shows a significant enhancement of Ca , Cr , Fe , Co , Na , Sc and Th , but declining trends for Br , Cu , P , Sb and Zn in locomotive shed workers .
In the case of welders : Ba , Co , Cu , K , Mn , Sc and Sb show enhancement whereas Br , Cr , Hg , Se , Th and Zn exhibit depletion .
Elemental contents have been correlated with possible sources of origin .
Comparison of mean elemental data for the present population around Nagpur city matches well with the reported data for Bombay and Delhi .
Comparative data from other countries are also presented .
