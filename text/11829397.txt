Hair analysis was used for the assessment of exposure to organochlorine pollutants in specimens from Greece , Romania and Belgium .
A simple method ( using 3 N HCI as incubation reagent , liquid-liquid extraction with hexane/ dichloromethane ( DCM ) , alumina/acid silica clean-up and GC-ECD/GC-MS analysis ) was used for screening of specimens .
The highest organochlorine load ( up to 148 ng/g hair for the sum of PCB , DDT and hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) isomers ) was found in samples from a group of Greek women with past occupational exposure to pesticides .
DDTs were the main organochlorine pollutants in Greek samples ( up to 70% ) , while in Belgian hair samples their contribution was reduced to 40% .
PCB mean concentration was higher in Belgian specimens ( up to 14 ng/g hair ) .
Lindane ( y-HCH ) was the main HCH isomer found in the samples ( up to 82% in the Greek samples ) .
Contribution of p,p'-DDT to the sum of DDTs was higher in Greek samples and indicates recent exposure to technical DDT .
Similar PCB 153/sum PCBs ratios were found for each of the three countries suggesting similar sources of pollution with PCBs ( mainly dietary ) .
Artificially coloured hair samples were found to have lower , but not statistically significant concentrations of organochlorine pollutants than the non-coloured hair .
