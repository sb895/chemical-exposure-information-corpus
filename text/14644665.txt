The collapse of the World Trade Center ( WTC ) on 11 September 2001 exposed New York City firefighters to smoke and dust of unprecedented magnitude and duration .
The chemicals and the concentrations produced from any fire are difficult to predict , but estimates of internal dose exposures can be assessed by the biological monitoring of blood and urine .
We analyzed blood and urine specimens obtained from 321 firefighters responding to the WTC fires and collapse for 110 potentially fire-related chemicals .
Controls consisted of 47 firefighters not present at the WTC .
Sampling occurred 3 weeks after 11 September , while fires were still burning .
When reference or background ranges were available , most chemical concentrations were found to be generally low and not outside these ranges .
Compared with controls , the exposed firefighters showed significant differences in adjusted geometric means for six of the chemicals and significantly greater detection rates for an additional three .
Arrival time was a significant predictor variable for four chemicals .
Special Operations Command firefighters ( n = 95 ) , compared with other responding WTC firefighters ( n = 226 ) , had differences in concentrations or detection rate for 14 of the chemicals .
Values for the Special Operations Command firefighters were also significantly different from the control group values for these same chemicals and for two additional chemicals .
Generally , the chemical concentrations in the other firefighter group were not different from those of controls .
Biomonitoring was used to characterize firefighter exposure at the WTC disaster .
Although some of the chemicals analyzed showed statistically significant differences , these differences were generally small .
