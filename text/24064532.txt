Measurements from central site ( CS ) monitors are often used as estimates of exposure in air pollution epidemiological studies .
As these measurements are typically limited in their spatiotemporal resolution , true exposure variability within a population is often obscured , leading to potential measurement errors .
To fully examine this limitation , we developed a set of alternative daily exposure metrics for each of the 169 ZIP codes in the Atlanta , GA , metropolitan area , from 1999 to 2002 , for PM(2.5) and its components ( elemental carbon ( EC ) , SO(4) ) , O(3) , carbon monoxide ( CO ) , and nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) .
Metrics were applied in a study investigating the respiratory health effects of these pollutants .
The metrics included : ( i ) CS measurements ( one CS per pollutant ) ; ( ii ) air quality model results for regional background pollution ; ( iii ) local-scale AERMOD air quality model results ; ( iv ) hybrid air quality model estimates ( a combination of ( ii ) and ( iii) ) ; and ( iv ) population exposure model predictions ( SHEDS and APEX ) .
Differences in estimated spatial and temporal variability were compared by exposure metric and pollutant .
Comparisons showed that : ( i ) both hybrid and exposure model estimates exhibited high spatial variability for traffic-related pollutants ( CO , NO(x) , and EC ) , but little spatial variability among ZIP code centroids for regional pollutants ( PM(2.5) , SO(4) , and O(3) ) ; ( ii ) for all pollutants except NO(x) , temporal variability was consistent across metrics ; ( iii ) daily hybrid-to-exposure model correlations were strong ( r>0.82 ) for all pollutants , suggesting that when temporal variability of pollutant concentrations is of main interest in an epidemiological application , the use of estimates from either model may yield similar results ; ( iv ) exposure models incorporating infiltration parameters , time-location-activity budgets , and other exposure factors affect the magnitude and spatiotemporal distribution of exposure , especially for local pollutants .
The results of this analysis can inform the development of more appropriate exposure metrics for future epidemiological studies of the short-term effects of particulate and gaseous ambient pollutant exposure in a community .
