Serum concentrations of CB-153 and p,p'-DDE were assessed for 354 men and women from the Swedish Fishermen's Families Cohort , and were found to correlate very well ( Pearson's r=0.72 ) .
In this particular cohort the main source of exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds are consumption of contaminated fatty fish .
High correlations between total PCB/CB-153 and p,p'-DDE have also been found in other population with similar exposure , but not in populations whose major source of exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds is not necessarily through the consumption of contaminated sea food .
The authors suggest that when investigating a possible relation between exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds and different health outcomes in populations with exposure similar to the Swedish Fishermen's Families Cohort , there may be no need to analyze more than either CB-153 or p,p'-DDE .
