This study aimed to examine the influence of the consumption of traditional foods on the relationship between fish consumption and mercury ( Hg ) exposure .
A 12-month prospective dietary survey was carried out with 26 adult women from a fish-eating community in the Brazilian Amazon .
Food ingestion was determined using a daily food diary , and total hair Hg levels were assessed for each month through sequential analyses using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry .
Simple and multiple regression analyses showed that the strong relationship between fish consumption and Hg exposure was significantly modified by fruit consumption : for the same number of fish meals , those who ate more tropical fruits had lower hair mercury levels .
The findings of this study indicate different ways of maintaining fish consumption while reducing Hg exposure in the Amazon .
A number of phytochemicals and nutritional fibers present in fruits might be interacting with Hg in several ways : absorption and excretion , transport , binding to target proteins , metabolism , and sequestration .
More studies are required on larger populations to further elucidate the extent and public health implications of the use of fruits to counteract the toxic action of methylmercury .
