Non-occupational inhalation and ingestion exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) has been studied in 8 non-smoking volunteers through personal air sampling and urinary biomonitoring .
The study period was divided into 4 segments ( 2 days/segment ) , including weekdays with regular commute and weekends with limited traffic related exposures ; each segment had a high or low PAH diet .
Personal air samples were collected continuously from the subjects while at home , at work , and while commuting to and from work .
All urine excretions were collected as individual samples during the study .
In personal air samples , 28 PAHs were measured , and in urine samples 9 mono-hydroxylated metabolites ( OH-PAHs ) from 4 parent PAHs ( naphthalene , fluorene , phenanthrene and pyrene ) were measured .
Naphthalene was found at higher concentrations in air samples collected at the subjects ' residences , whereas PAHs with four or more aromatic rings were found at higher levels in samples taken while commuting .
Urinary OH-PAH biomarker levels increased following reported high inhalation and/or dietary exposure .
On days with a low PAH diet , the total amount of inhaled naphthalene during each 24-hour period was well correlated with the amount of excreted naphthols , as was , to a lesser extent , fluorene with its urinary metabolites .
During days with a high dietary intake , only naphthalene was significantly correlated with its excreted metabolite .
These findings suggest that this group of non-occupational subjects were exposed to naphthalene primarily through indoor air inhalation , and exposed to other PAHs such as pyrene mainly through ingestion .
