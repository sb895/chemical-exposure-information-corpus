The frequencies of 10 diseases in a cadmium ( and zinc ) contaminated region in The Netherlands were analysed by comparing hospital admissions with those of a non-contaminated region and with national values .
No significant differences were found for diseases which are commonly associated with increased cadmium uptake such as renal insufficiency , nephrolithiasis , hypertension , cancer , immaturity of the new-born .
For the contaminated region a significantly higher frequency was only found for atherosclerosis ; this was relatively strong for men aged > 40 yrs .
However , no higher death frequency for atherosclerosis was observed .
The results are discussed in relation to limitations in the evaluation techniques used .
The absence of major health risks in the contaminated area is obvious , but the possible influence of long term-low level cadmium uptake on atherosclerosis requires more attention .
