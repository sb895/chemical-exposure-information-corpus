In a group of 43 smelter workers exposed to inorganic arsenic dust for 13-45 years , nerve conduction velocities ( NCVs ) were significantly lower in two peripheral nerves as compared with matching referents .
With multivariate data analysis , a significant negative correlation was found between cumulative absorption of arsenic and NCV in four examined nerves and the sural amplitude .
Clinical symptoms of neuropathy and other symptoms related to arsenic exposure were moderate , though the difference between the groups was significant .
The mean total absorption of arsenic was calculated to be less than 5 g , and the maximal absorption about 20 g .
These data indicate that the adverse effect of arsenic on the peripheral nerves is dependent on long-term exposure rather than on short-term fluctuations in exposure levels .
