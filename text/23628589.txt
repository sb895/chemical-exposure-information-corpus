We characterized the sources of variability for polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in residential dust and provided guidance for investigators who plan to use residential dust to assess exposure to PBDEs .
We collected repeat dust samples from 292 households in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study during two sampling rounds ( from 2001 to 2007 and during 2010 ) using household vacuum cleaners and measured 22 PBDEs using high resolution gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry .
Median concentrations for individual PBDEs ranged from <0.1-2500ng per g of dust .
For each of eight representative PBDEs , we used a random-effects model to apportion total variance into regional variability ( 0-11% ) , intra-regional between-household variability ( 17-50% ) , within-household variability over time ( 38-74% ) , and within-sample variability ( 0-23% ) and we used a mixed-effects model to identify determinants of PBDE levels .
Regional differences in PBDE dust levels were associated with residential characteristics that differed by region , including the presence of furniture with exposed or crumbling foam and the recent installation of carpets in the residence .
Intra-regional differences between households were associated with neighborhood urban density , racial and ethnic characteristics , and to a lesser extent , income .
For some PBDEs , a decreasing time trend explained a modest fraction of the within-household variability ; however , most of the within-household variability was unaccounted for by our mixed-effects models .
Our findings indicate that it may be feasible to use residential dust for retrospective assessment of PBDE exposures in studies of children's health ( e.g. , the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study ) .
