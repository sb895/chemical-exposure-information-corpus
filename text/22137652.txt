BACKGROUND Environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) is one of the most important sources for indoor air pollution and a substantial threat to human health , but data on the concentrations of the trace metals cerium ( Ce ) and lanthanum ( La ) in context with ETS exposure are scarce .
Therefore the aim of our study was to quantify Ce and La concentrations in indoor air with high ETS load .
METHODS In two subsequent investigations Ce , La and cadmium ( Cd ) in 3 smokers ' ( 11 samples ) and 7 non-smokers ' ( 28 samples ) households as well as in 28 hospitality venues in Southern Germany were analysed .
Active sampling of indoor air was conducted continuously for seven days in every season in the smokers ' and non-smokers ' residences , and for 4h during the main visiting hours in the hospitality venues ( restaurants , pubs , and discotheques ) .
RESULTS In terms of residences median levels of Cd were 0.1 ng/m(3) for non-smokers ' and 0.8 ng/m(3) for smokers ' households .
Median concentrations of Ce were 0.4 ng/m(3) and 9.6 ng/m(3) , and median concentrations of La were 0.2 ng/m(3) and 5.9 ng/m(3) for non-smokers ' and for smokers ' households , respectively .
In the different types of hospitality venues median levels ranged from 2.6 to 9.7 ng/m(3) for Cd , from 18.5 to 50.0 ng/m(3) for Ce and from 10.6 to 23.0 ng/m(3) for La with highest median levels in discotheques .
CONCLUSIONS The high concentrations of Ce and La found in ETS enriched indoor air of smokers ' households and hospitality venues are an important finding as Ce and La are associated with adverse health effects and data on this issue are scarce .
Further research on their toxicological , human and public health consequences is urgently required .
