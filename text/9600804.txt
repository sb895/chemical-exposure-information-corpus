In 29 volunteers with a low amalgam load , the number of amalgam-covered tooth surfaces and the occlusal area of the fillings were determined .
Concentrations of total mercury were measured in plasma and erythrocytes as well as in urine together with the excretion rate .
Absorbed daily doses were estimated from intraoral Hg emission by two separate methods .
The transfer of Hg from the fillings via the oral cavity and blood to urinary excretion was evaluated according to the most representative combination of parameters .
This consisted of urinary excretion ( 1 ) , Hg concentration in plasma ( 2 ) , absorbed dose ( 3 ) , and occlusal area ( 4 ) .
Pairwise correlation coefficients were 0.75 for parameters 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3 and 0.49 for parameters 3 vs 4 .
Within 9 days after removal of the fillings , a transient increase was observed in plasma Hg levels only .
This was reduced in those volunteers to whom a rubber dam had been applied during removal .
Peak plasma Hg was 0.6 ng/ml on average and decreased with halftimes between 5 and 13 days .
A significant decrease in Hg excretion was noted not before 100 days after removal .
Being relatively insensitive to dietary mercury , the determination of total mercury in plasma and of its urinary excretion rate appears , under practical aspects , most suitable for the investigation of Hg uptake from amalgam .
