In order to determine if there are any residual effects of long-term exposure to mercury vapor , neurobehavioral tests were given to ex-mercury miners about 18 years after the cessation of mercury exposure .
Seventy-six male ex-mercury miners who had been exposed to relatively high concentrations of mercury vapor ( over 1.0 mg/m3 ) and with a past history of mercury intoxication were compared to age ( +/- 3 years)- , sex- , and years of education-matched controls .
Although the extent of the workers ' symptoms caused by mercury poisoning , termed erethismus merculialis , markedly decreased after the cessation of exposure , the prevalence of neurological symptoms ( such as hand tremors , headaches , and slurred speech ) and symptoms of senility ( such as low-back pain , loss of sexual desire ) in the ex-miners was significantly higher than those in the controls .
Matched-pair analysis showed that performances of motor coordination , Simple reaction time , and Short-term memory in the ex-miners were significantly deteriorated compared to those of controls .
There are slight but persistent effects on neurobehavioral function , especially on motor coordination function , among mercury miners more than 10 years after the cessation of exposure .
