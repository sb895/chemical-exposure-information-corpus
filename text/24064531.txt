Environmental levels of airborne carcinogenic and related substances are comparatively better known than individual exposure and its determinants .
We report on a personal monitoring program involving five Swedish urban populations .
The aim of the program was to investigate personal exposure to benzene , 1,3-butadiene , formaldehyde , and nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) .
The measurements were performed among 40 inhabitants during seven consecutive days , in one urban area each year , during 2000-2008 .
The estimated population exposure levels were 1.95\u2009\u03bcg/m(3) for benzene , 0.56\u2009\u03bcg/m(3) for 1,3-butadiene , 19.4\u2009\u03bcg/m(3) for formaldehyde , and 14.1\u2009\u03bcg/m(3) for NO2 .
Statistical analysis using a mixed-effects model revealed that time spent in traffic and time outdoors contributed to benzene and 1,3- butadiene exposure .
For benzene , refueling a car was an additional determinant influencing the exposure level .
Smoking or environmental tobacco smoke were significant determinants of exposure to NO2 , benzene , and 1,3-butadiene .
Those with a gas stove had higher NO2 exposure .
Living in a single-family house increased the exposure to formaldehyde significantly .
In a variance component model , the between-subject variance dominated for 1,3-butadiene and formaldehyde , whereas the between-city variance dominated for NO2 .
For benzene , the between-subject and between-cities variances were similar.Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication , 25 September 2013 ; doi:10.1038/jes.2013.57 .
