BACKGROUND Construction boilermakers may be exposed to a variety of substances , including asbestos and welding fumes .
Past studies of boilermakers have shown increases in mortality from lung cancer and asbestosis and radiographic changes consistent with asbestos exposure .
METHODS Respiratory symptoms , lung function , and radiographic changes were compared for 102 actively employed boilermakers with 20 or more years of union membership and 100 telephone workers .
Posteroanterior chest radiographs were evaluated by two experienced chest physicians , with a third arbitrating disagreed films .
Union members were further categorized as boilermakers ( n = 50 ) or welders ( n = 52 ) , based on longest service .
Lung health was also compared with employment in a number of work sectors for time , and time-weighted exposure to dust and fumes .
RESULTS Boilermakers had more respiratory symptoms than telephone workers , but lung function did not differ .
Radiographic changes were more common among the boilermakers ( 20% with any change , 8% circumscribed , and 9% diffuse pleural thickening ) .
None of the boilermakers had small radiographic opacities .
Several symptoms suggestive of bronchial responsiveness were associated with fume exposures in the gas and oil industry .
Workers whose longest service was as a boilermaker demonstrated more symptoms than did welders .
FEV1 , FEV1/FVC , FEF25-75 , and FEF50 were significantly lower among boilermakers compared with welders .
CONCLUSION Health screening programs for these workers are warranted .
