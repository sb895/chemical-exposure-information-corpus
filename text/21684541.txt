Exposure to phthalates and Bisphenol A could cause developmental and reproductive toxicity .
This study provides a first assessment of these exposures for more than 250 French pregnant women .
The median concentrations of total and free Bisphenol A in urine were similar to those in other studies except the highest concentrations ( 5% of women had total and free Bisphenol A >50\u03bcg/L ) .
Our study highlights high levels of Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate metabolites in pregnant women , suggesting recent exposure , probably in hospital .
Differences between types of delivery ( caesarean vs. natural ) support this hypothesis .
This is a significant implication for large-scale biomonitoring studies among this population .
