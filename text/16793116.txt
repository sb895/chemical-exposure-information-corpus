Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) have recently received attention due to their widespread contamination in the environment , as well as in wildlife and humans .
We measured the PFOS and PFOA concentrations in historically recorded human serum samples at an age range between 20 and 59 years collected in Kyoto , 20 persons per each time point ( n=100 ) , and also the PFOS and PFOA concentrations in human serum samples at an age range between 20 and 59 years from 10 locations throughout Japan ( n=200 ) .
The historical samples collected from 1983 to 1999 demonstrated that the PFOA concentrations in males and females from Kyoto have increased 4.4-fold and 4.3-fold at a rate of increase of 0.49 ng/ml/year and 0.42 ng/ml/year , respectively .
In contrast , serum concentrations of PFOS reached a plateau in the late 1980s .
There are also regional differences in both the PFOS and PFOA serum concentrations .
The concentrations in serum [ geometric mean ( geometric standard deviation) ] ( ng/ml ) in 2003-2004 ranged from 7.6(1.6) in the town of Matsuoka in Fukui prefecture to 27.8(1.6) in Kyoto city , and ranged from 2.3(1.5) in Matsuoka to 14.5(1.3) in Osaka city for PFOS and PFOA , respectively .
