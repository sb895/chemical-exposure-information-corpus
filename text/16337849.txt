Cadmium ( Cd ) in the human diet constitutes a potential chronic hazard to health .
In the nonsmoking general population , diet is the major source of cadmium exposure ; therefore , it is important to monitor the dietary intake of this heavy metal to quantify and improve the understanding of Cd accumulation in the human body .
The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of Cd in a range of food and drink commonly consumed in the Canary Islands .
Food samples ( 420 ) were analyzed for Cd by atomic absorption spectrometry .
The most recent nutritional survey conducted for the Canarian population was used to define the food and drink groups analyzed .
The measured Cd concentrations combined with the food consumption data resulted in a total Cd intake in the Canary Islands of 0.16 microg/kg of body weight/day , which is well below the respective provisional tolerable weekly intake of Cd of 1 microg/kg of body weight per day determined by the FAO/WHO .
The results are also compared with values reported for other national and international communities .
