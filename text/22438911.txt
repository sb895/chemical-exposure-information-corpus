The enormous increase in practically unregulated mining in Madre de Dios Peru is leading to massive release of liquid elemental mercury to the environment .
Rapidly increasing global prices for gold are causing a massive upsurge in artisanal mining in the Peruvian Amazon , considered to be one of the most biodiverse places on the planet .
This study identifies the current levels of mercury in the human population , through identifying levels of total mercury in human hair in mining zones of Madre de Dios Department and in the nearby city of Puerto Maldonado .
A regression analysis reveals that fish consumption , gender , and location of residence were significant indicators of mercury levels ; while duration of residence and age had no significant relationship to mercury levels .
Increased fish consumption levels were the strongest indicators of increased total mercury levels across the entire population .
The levels of total mercury in hair was significantly ( \u03b1 = 0.05 ) higher in mining zones , than Puerto Maldonado .
In both areas men had significantly higher levels than women , likely due to a difference in metabolism or varying levels of direct involvement in gold mining- a male predominated industry .
This is the first study to show the health threat that mercury poses to this region , however further research needs to be done to gain a more refined understanding of the predominant routes of exposure in this population .
