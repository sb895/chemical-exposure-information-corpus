Breast milk is a noninvasive specimen to assess maternal and infant exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) .
In this study , 206 breast milk samples were collected from 87 participants during lactation , at <7 , 15 , 30 , or 90 days postpartum in four cities in Korea .
The total concentrations of PCBs ( \u03a3PCB ) and OCPs ( \u03a3OCP ) ranged from <LOQ to 84.0 ( median : 12.1 ) ng g(-1) lipid weight and from <LOQ to 559 ( median : 144 ) ng g(-1) lipid weight , respectively .
The residue levels of these contaminants measured in our study were relatively lower than those reported for European , African and Asian populations .
Within a month postpartum typically after day seven the levels of \u03a3PCB and \u03a3OCP significantly increased .
Some OCP compounds were correlated with maternal age , BMI , parity , and delivery mode .
Certain types of dietary habits such as seafood and noodle consumption were significantly associated with \u03a3PCB and \u03a3OCP .
The estimated daily intakes ( EDIs ) of \u03a3PCB and \u03a3OCP were 45.2-127 ng kg(-1) bw day(-1) and 625-1259 ng kg(-1) bw day(-1) during lactation , respectively , which are lower than the threshold values proposed by the US EPA and Health Canada .
The exposure of Korean infants to chlordanes via breast milk had a potential health risk which deserves further investigation .
