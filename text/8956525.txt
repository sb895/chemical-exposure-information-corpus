A study using individual dosimetry to evaluate the daily inhaled dose of sixteen aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons in three groups of primary school children , living in three Italian towns with 50,000 inhabitants or less , ( Treviglio-Lombardy ; Poggibonsi-Tuscany ; Valenza-Piedmont ) is presented .
The simultaneous use of two passive samplers ( radial diffusion ) for each child , for a 24 h period , determined both the indoor and indoor + outdoor environmental reference concentrations .
We measured the urinary levels of benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene and xylenes for each child and hence determined the urinary reference values for BTEX .
We also considered the possibility of using benzene in urine as a biomarker of environmental exposure of the general population to this xenobiotic .
We evaluated how both the environmental and biological measures were influenced by the presence of smokers in the surveyed children's houses .
For the group of children living in Poggibonsi , we considered the influence of the living area and the traffic density on environmental concentrations of benzene ( indoor and indoor + outdoor ) .
