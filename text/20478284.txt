BACKGROUND Although interactions of arsenite and selenite in mammalian organisms have been suggested by literature data , the antioxidant effects and biochemical mechanisms of dietary selenium on human populations exposed to inorganic arsenic are not fully understood .
METHODS Total blood , urine and hair concentrations of arsenic and selenium were determined in all individuals by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry .
The individuals with skin lesions were subsequently classified as " High As group " and " High Se/As group " and controls were classified as " High Se group " and " Control group " according to their blood selenium concentrations .
RESULTS High selenium status was correlated with elevated activities of serum superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase , catalase , and reduced levels of malondialdehyde , and increased RNA and protein expression of heme oxygenase-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) of individuals in the high arsenic group .
Urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels were positively associated with blood arsenic , but inversely with blood and hair selenium among individuals with skin lesions , whereas mRNA are protein levels of 8-oxoganine DNA glycosylase 1 in PBMC increased in the " High Se/As group " compared to the " High As group " .
CONCLUSIONS Inorganic arsenic exposure is associated with oxidative stress , which may be prevented by high selenium status via its antioxidative activity and detoxification effect possibly through the formation of an arsenic and selenium containing metabolite , the seleno-bis(S-glutathionyl) arsinium ion .
