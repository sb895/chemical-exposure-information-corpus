The study reports the use of three biomarkers i.e. total arsenic in hair and nails , total arsenic in blood , and total arsenic in urine to identify or quantify arsenic exposure and concomitant health effects .
The main source of arsenic was inorganic exposure through drinking water .
The arsenic levels and the health effects were analyzed closely in a family having maximum symptoms of arsenic .
Based on the result of this study it is reported that there exist a correlation between the clinically observable symptoms , the blood and urine arsenic level , and the arsenic intake through drinking water .
An intensive study on the urinary arsenic levels was carried out in which the urine levels of arsenic and the urine sufficiency tests were performed .
A composite picture of body burden of arsenic has been obtained by carrying out a complete biochemical analysis of a maximum affected family .
This confirms pronounced chronic exposure of the arsenic to these people .
A combined correlation study on the arsenic levels measured in whole blood , urine , hair , nails and age present a remarkable outcome .
Accordingly , the arsenic levels in blood are negatively correlated with the urine arsenic levels , which indicate either the inadequacy of the renal system in cleaning the blood arsenic or a continuous recirculation of the accumulated arsenic .
This is an important conclusion about arsenical metabolism in humans .
The study also raises the issues of the prospects of complete elimination of the accumulated arsenic and the reversibility of the health effects .
Based on the work in Kourikasa village we report that there are very remote chances of complete purging of arsenic and thus reversibility of the health effects owing to various factors .
The paper also discusses the various issues concerning the chronic arsenic poisoning management in the affected locations .
