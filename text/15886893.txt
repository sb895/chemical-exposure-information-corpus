Our environment is polluted with toxic compounds including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) .
We investigated the suitability of hair analysis for testing human exposure to toxic compounds .
Hair analysis revealed that municipal solid-waste ( MSW ) incineration workers were exposed to PCDDs , PCDFs , and Co-PCBs at high levels .
The total 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalent concentration in MSW incineration workers was 2.5 times higher than in the general population , thus indicating that the indoor environment of the incineration facility was more polluted than the general environment .
There were also characteristic patterns of occurrence of these dioxin-like compounds in the hair of smokers from the general population .
We confirmed that hair analysis is useful for evaluating human exposure to PCDDs , PCDFs , and Co-PCBs in the atmosphere .
