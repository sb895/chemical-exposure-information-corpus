Examination of 60 inhabitants ( including 28 children ) of a village 900 m from a copper smelter with concurrent monitoring of air pollution was performed .
Blood levels of lead and cadmium were measured three times in five years .
At the same time dust amounts and air-dust concentrations of Cu , Pb , Cd , Mn , Cr , Zn , Ni and As were measured .
In the first phase of the investigation , for nearly 60% of days Pb and Cu air concentrations exceeded 2-5 times the norm .
In the third stage , after significant reductions of gas-dust emissions ( copper from 992 to 47 tons/year , lead from 1720 to 30 tons/year ) no excessive metal air concentrations are noted .
In the first examination the average blood lead concentration was 0.766 +/- 0.14 microgram/ml ( in the group of children 0.52 +/- 0.07 microgram/ml ) .
After five years , there was a statistically significant decrease in the blood concentrations of lead , to 0.44 +/- 0.14 microgram/ml ( children 0.31 +/- 0.05 microgram/ml ) , and cadmium , to 0.028 +/- 0.007 microgram/ml ( children 0.019 +/- 0.004 microgram/ml ) .
A big lead and cadmium load in the villagers , despite the substantial reduction of gas and dust emission , points to the contamination of the surroundings of the cooper smelter .
