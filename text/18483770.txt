Several studies indicate health problems among hairdressers to be related to their chemical exposure at work .
The purpose of this study was to describe the exposure of chemical compounds in the air of Spanish hairdresser salons , and to study differences between salons in central and suburban areas .
Ten hairdresser salons were examined for two days , by recording number and type of customers , ventilation and size of salon .
Both stationary and personal borne samples for organic compounds were collected , as well as stationary samples of ammonia .
TVOC was calculated .
Air temperature , relative humidity , CO and CO2 were logged for 48 h in each salon .
Fifty-six personal and 28 stationary samples were analysed for organic compounds .
Thirty-five different air-borne compounds were found in the working environment of the hairdressers .
All levels were well below the limit values in Spain and USA , both for ammonia and organic compounds .
TVOC ranged from 48.37 mg/m3 to 237.60 mg/m3 , meaning that many salons had levels above suggested comfort values of 25 .
There were only minor differences in exposure between central and suburban salons .
No salons had ventilation systems , and the CO2 was increasing during the day .
The exposure was higher for several chemical compounds when hair dying was performed .
Hairdressers were exposed to low air levels of a large number of chemical substances mostly related to work related to hair dying .
There were no differences between exposure levels in salons in central and suburban areas .
