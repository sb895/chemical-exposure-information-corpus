BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Pigmentation and keratosis are the prerequisites to diagnose arsenicosis .
However , many systemic manifestations occur in association with pigmentation and keratosis in people exposed to chronic drinking of arsenic contaminated water .
The present study aim to find out whether systemic manifestations occur in significant number of cases in arsenic exposed people in the absence of skin lesions in an affected district in West Bengal , India .
METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out in South 24 Parganas , an arsenic affected district of West Bengal , India .
Both dermatological and systemic manifestations were recorded and water samples collected for arsenic analysis from 7683 participants .
A correlation of systemic manifestations in relation to arsenic exposure was carried out in subjects having no arsenical skin lesion .
Prevalence odds ratio ( POR ) was calculated for each outcome comparing those with high arsenic exposure with those with lowest exposure .
RESULTS The frequency of occurrence of various clinical manifestations like weakness , anaemia , diarrhoea , hepatomegaly and lung disease was found to be significantly higher among participants drinking water having arsenic concentration > or = 50 microg/l in comparison to those taking water with arsenic content below this level .
Further , there was increased occurrence of these manifestations with increasing concentration of arsenic level in drinking water , and this followed a dose-response relationship .
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION It appears that it is worthwhile to include people with systemic manifestations in absence of skin lesions with evidence of arsenic exposure as suspected cases of arsenicosis for case detection and in surveillance programme .
