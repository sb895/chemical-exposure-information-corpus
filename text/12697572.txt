The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was an association between occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields ( EMFs ) or polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and mortality from prostate cancer among US electric utility workers .
Data on participants , who were current and former employees of five large US electric utility companies , had been collected during 1987-1994 , and the mortality of the cohort was followed through 1988 .
This nested case-control study contained 387 cases , men whose underlying cause of death was prostate cancer , and five controls for each case .
Workers categorized in the highest 10 percent of EMF exposure were twice as likely to die from prostate cancer as those exposed to EMFs at lower levels , after adjustment for PCB exposure , race , and active work status within the past 2 years ( odds ratio = 2.02 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.34 , 3.04 ) .
The odds ratio for PCB exposure and prostate cancer mortality was 1.47 ( 95% CI : 0.97 , 2.24 ) after adjustment for suspected confounding factors .
Exposure to high levels of both EMFs and PCBs showed no association with prostate cancer mortality .
Non-White race was strongly associated with risk of prostate cancer mortality ( odds ratio = 3.67 , 95% CI : 2.66 , 5.06 ) .
The association between EMF exposure and prostate cancer mortality warrants further investigation .
