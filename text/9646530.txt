Pediatric heavy metal ( particularly lead ) poisoning is a widespread , yet preventable problem in many parts of the world .
Interior floor dust is found to be one of the major pathways of childhood exposure .
However , school and health authorities in most countries do not have any stipulations nor guidelines in regulating heavy metal contamination in floor dusts in schools .
This study attempts to examine the level of heavy metal contamination in 53 nursery schools and kindergartens in Hong Kong and study its relationship with the environmental factors .
The results of this study reveal that the arithmetic mean level of lead in exterior dust is 280.01 mg/kg , with a minimum level of 48.80 mg/kg and a maximum of 2108.31 mg/kg , which is somewhat lower than other studies , such as those reported by Chan et al .
( Biomed .
Environ .
Sci. 1989;2:131-140 ) and Akhter and Madany ( Water Air Soil Pollut. 1993;66:111-119 ) , but those of the manganese ( mean = 532.16 mg/kg , range = 102.51-1736.25 mg/kg ) and zinc levels ( mean = 2694.23 mg/kg , range = 898.33-9899.85 mg/kg ) are much higher .
Out of the 10 districts examined , Kwun Tong and North Point are found to be the most polluted .
They are older districts with polluting industries and heavy traffic .
The results of the analysis of variance suggest that the heavy metal particulate may originate from the exterior .
Auto-vehicles are a likely source .
The toxins are blown inside through the opened windows .
Other factors that may affect the content of metal in floor dusts are the time since the school was last painted , the age of the housing complex , the condition of the school and the use of vacuum cleaners .
