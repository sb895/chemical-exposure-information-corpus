Internationally publicized impacts upon human health associated with potentially harmful element ( PHE ) exposure have been reported amongst internally displaced populations ( IDPs ) in Mitrovica , Kosovo , following the Kosovan War .
Particular concern has surrounded the exposure to Pb indicated by the presence of highly elevated concentrations of Pb in blood and hair samples .
This study utilizes a physiologically-based in-vitro extraction method to assess the bioaccessibility of PHEs in surface soils and metallurgical waste in Mitrovica and assesses the potential daily intake of soil-bound PHEs .
Maximum As ( 210mgkg(-1) ) , Cd ( 38mgkg(-1) ) , Cu ( 410mgkg(-1) ) , Pb ( 18790mgkg(-1) ) and Zn ( 8500mgkg(-1) ) concentrations in surface soils ( 0-10cm ) are elevated above guideline values .
Samples with high PHE concentrations ( e.g .
As >1000mgkg(-1) ; Pb >1500mgkg(-1) ) exhibit a wide range of bioaccessibilities ( 5.40 - 92.20% in the gastric ( G ) phase and 10.00 - 55.80% in the gastric-intestinal ( G-I ) phase ) .
Samples associated with lower bioaccessibilities typically contain a number of XRD-identifiable primary and secondary mineral phases , particularly As- and Pb-bearing arsenian pyrite , beudantite , galena and cerrusite .
Quantification of the potential human exposure risk associated with the ingestion of soil-associated PHEs indicates that on average , 0.01\u03bcg Cd kg(-1) BW d(-1) , 0.16\u03bcg Cu kg(-1) BW d(--1) , 0.12\u03bcg As kg(-1) BW d(-1) , 7.81\u03bcg Pb kg(-1) BW d(-1) , and 2.68\u03bcg Zn kg(-1) BW d(-1) could be bioaccessible following ingestion of PHE-rich soils in the Mitrovica region , with Pb , and to a lesser extent As , indicating the likely possibility of local populations exceeding the recommended tolerable daily intake .
Lead present within surface soils of the area could indeed have contributed to the human Pb burden due to the high bioaccessibility of Pb present within these soils ( 13.40 - 92.20% in the gastric phase ) .
Data for Pb levels in scalp hair ( \u2264120\u03bcgg(-1) ) and blood ( \u2265650\u03bcgdL(-1) ; WHO , 2004 ) for children that have lived within IDP camps in Mitrovica indicate significant Pb uptake has indeed taken place .
The highly bioaccessible nature of soil-associated PHEs in this study highlights the need for appropriate environmental management approaches that limit the exposure of local populations to these contaminated soils .
