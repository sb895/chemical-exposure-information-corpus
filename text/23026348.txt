Human biomonitoring studies measuring bisphenol A ( BPA ) in urine have shown widespread exposure in the general population .
Diet is thought to be a major route of exposure .
We studied urinary BPA patterns in five individuals over a 48-h period of fasting ( bottled water only ) .
Personal activity patterns were recorded with a diary to investigate non-dietary routes of exposure .
All urine void events during the fast were collected , as well as events before and after the fast .
The pattern of BPA concentrations was similar for all participants : they rose near the beginning of the fast ( after the pre-fast meal ) , declined over the next 24h , fluctuated at lower levels during the second day , and then rose after the post-fast meal .
Concentrations ( \u03bcg/g creatine ) and calculated BPA intakes ( \u03bcg/kg-day ) in these individuals during the first 24h were consistent with general population exposures .
For the second 24h , concentrations and intakes declined by about two-thirds .
One of the individuals had an extraordinary pre-fast exposure event with concentrations rising as high as 98 \u03bcg/g creatine but declining to <5 \u03bcg/g creatine by day 2 .
Given patterns found in day 1 and the subsequent decline to lower levels in day 2 , we hypothesize that BPA exposures in these individuals were diet-driven .
No events in the diary ( use of personal care products , e.g. ) appear associated with exposures .
On day 2 , non-dietary sources may still be present , such as from dust .
Another hypothesis is that small reservoirs of BPA from past exposures are released from storage ( lipid reservoirs , e.g. ) and excreted .
