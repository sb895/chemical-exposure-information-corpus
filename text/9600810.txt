Within a cohort of 1022 consecutive singleton births in the Faroe Islands , we assessed prenatal methylmercury exposure from the maternal hair mercury concentration .
At approximately 7 years of age , 917 of the children underwent detailed neurobehavioral examination .
Little risk is thought to occur as long as the hair mercury concentration in pregnant women is kept below 10-20 microg/g ( 50-100 nmol/l ) .
A case group of 112 children whose mothers had a hair mercury concentration of 10-20 microg/g was therefore matched to children with exposure below 3 microg/g , using age , sex , time of examination , and the mother's score on Raven's Progressive Matrices as matching criteria .
The two groups were almost identical with regard to other factors that might affect neurobehavioral performance in this community .
On six neuropsychological test measures , the case group showed mild decrements , relative to controls , especially in the domains of motor function , language , and memory .
Subtle effects on brain function therefore seem to be detectable at prenatal methylmercury exposure levels currently considered to be safe .
