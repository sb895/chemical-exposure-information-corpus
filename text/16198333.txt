Many popular varieties of commercially sold fish , including tilefish , seabass , shark , and swordfish , contain enough mercury so that eating them once or twice a month can lead to high mercury body burdens .
Wisconsin has issued mercury-based sport-fish consumption advice to people of all ages since 1985 .
Wisconsin's advisory was revised in 2000 to address all inland waters and again in 2004 to integrate information about sport-caught fish with advice for commercially sold fish .
Because of the increased popularity of fish as a source of dietary protein , a significant percentage of the US population may be at risk of methylmercury-induced health problems .
Although several studies have assessed mercury exposure among children and women of child-bearing age , very little is known about mercury body burdens among men or postmenopausal women .
This article describes fish consumption and mercury exposure among 14 people who consumed fish twice a week or more and 1 person who ate no fish .
Steady-state blood mercury levels available for 10 adults and 1 child ranged from <5 to 58 microg/L and correlated well with dietary mercury intake estimates .
Three of these individuals reported vague , subclinical symptoms such as mental confusion , sleep difficulty , balance problems , or visual disturbances , which improved after their mercury levels returned to normal .
