The purpose of this study was to assess human exposure in the prenatal period to selected PBDEs ( BDE-47 , BDE-99 , BDE-153 ) and PCBs ( CB-77 , CB-101 , CB-118 , CB-126 , CB-138 , CB-153 , CB-170 , CB-180 ) basing on the analysis of these compounds in cord blood .
The experimental material consisted of 89 cord blood samples taken from women resident in Warsaw and its vicinity .
In over 90% of all tested samples the presence of congeners CB-153 , CB-138 , CB-180 and BDE-47 was identified .
The least frequently found were CB-126 and BDE-153 , which were present at relatively low concentration levels .
Among all analysed PCBs , the highest average concentrations were found in the case of congeners CB-138 ( 11.8 ng/g of fat ) and CB-153 ( 43.4 ng/g of fat ) , whereas the lowest was in the case of CB-170 ( 0.4 ng/g of fat ) and CB-126 ( 0.1 ng/g of fat ) .
In the case of PBDEs the greatest share in the total concentration was that of the congeners BDE-47 and BDE-99 , whereas the smallest share was that of the higher brominated congener BDE-153 .
These results suggest that human exposure to the examined compounds begins already in the period of intrauterine life .
The comparison of our own results with the findings of other authors indicates that the PCBs and PBDEs levels in cord blood of women living in Poland do not differ from the respective concentrations in cord blood of other female inhabitants of Europe .
