Heavy metals are environmental contaminants with properties known to be toxic for wildlife and humans .
Despite strong concerns about their harmful effects , little information is available on intrauterine exposure in humans .
The aim of this study was to evaluate prenatal exposure to As , Cd , Cr , Hg , Mn , and Pb and its association with maternal factors in a population-based mother-child cohort in Southern Spain .
Between 2000 and 2002 , 700 pregnant women were recruited and 137 placentas from the cohort were randomly selected and analyzed for the selected metals by atomic absorption .
Maternal sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were obtained by questionnaire after delivery .
Bivariate analysis and multivariate linear regression were performed .
Cd and Mn concentrations were detected in all placentas , while Cr , Pb , and Hg were found in 98.5% , 35.0% , and 30.7% of samples , respectively .
The highest concentrations were observed for Pb ( mean : 94.80 ng/g wet weight of placenta ) , followed by Mn ( 63.80 ng/g ) , Cr ( 63.70 ng/g ) , Cd ( 3.45 ng/g ) , and Hg ( 0.024 ng/g ) .
Arsenic was not detected in any sample .
Gestational age and smoking during pregnancy were associated with placental Cd concentrations , while no factor appeared to influence concentrations of Cr , Hg , Mn , or Pb .
In comparison to results of European studies , these concentrations are in a low-intermediate position .
Studies are required to investigate the factors contributing to early exposure to heavy metals and to determine how placental transfer of these toxic compounds may affect children's health .
