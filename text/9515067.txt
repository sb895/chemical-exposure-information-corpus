Lead-contaminated water , soil , and paint have been recognized as potential sources of children's lead exposure for decades , but their contributions to lead intake among urban children remain poorly defined .
This analysis was undertaken to estimate the relationship of environmental lead exposures to lead intake among a random sample of urban children , adjusted for exposure to lead-contaminated house dust .
Analyses of 183 urban children enrolled in a random sample , cross sectional study were conducted .
Children's blood and multiple measures of household dust , water , soil , and paint were analyzed for lead , and interviews were conducted to ascertain risk factors for childhood lead exposure .
Environmental sources of lead , including house-dust , soil lead , and water lead , were independently associated with children's blood lead levels .
In contrast , paint lead levels did not have a significant effect on blood lead levels after adjusting for other environmental exposures .
An increase in water lead concentration from background levels to 0.015 mg/L , the current EPA water lead standard , was associated with an increase of 13.7% in the percentage of children estimated to have a blood lead concentration exceeding 10 micrograms/dL ; increasing soil lead concentration from background to 400 micrograms/g was estimated to produce an increase of 11.6% in the percentage of children estimated to have a blood lead level exceeding 10 micrograms/dL , and increasing dust lead loading from background to 200 micrograms/ft2 is estimated to produce an increase of 23.3% in the percentage of children estimated to have a blood lead level exceeding 10 micrograms/dL .
These data support the promulgation of health-based standards for lead-contaminated dust and soil and the progressive lowering of standards for lead-contaminated water as the definition of undue lead exposure has been modified .
