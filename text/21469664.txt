Since 2002 , practices in manufacturing polyfluoroalkyl chemicals ( PFCs ) in the United States have changed .
Previous results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) documented a significant decrease in serum concentrations of some PFCs during 1999-2004 .
To further assess concentration trends of perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) , perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS ) , and perfluorononanoate ( PFNA ) , we analyzed 7876 serum samples collected from a representative sample of the general U.S. population \u226512 years of age during NHANES 1999-2008 .
We detected PFOS , PFOA , PFNA , and PFHxS in more than 95% of participants .
Concentrations differed by sex regardless of age and we observed some differences by race/ethnicity .
Since 1999-2000 , PFOS concentrations showed a significant downward trend , because of discontinuing industrial production of PFOS , but PFNA concentrations showed a significant upward trend .
PFOA concentrations during 1999-2000 were significantly higher than during any other time period examined , but PFOA concentrations have remained essentially unchanged during 2003-2008 .
PFHxS concentrations showed a downward trend from 1999 to 2006 , but concentrations increased during 2007-2008 .
Additional research is needed to identify the environmental sources contributing to human exposure to PFCs .
Nonetheless , these NHANES data suggest that sociodemographic factors may influence exposure and also provide unique information on temporal trends of exposure .
