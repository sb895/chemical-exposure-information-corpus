Follow-up investigation on hair arsenic concentration was conducted in an arsenic heavily polluted area of southern China in 2002 and 2006 .
The results showed that the geometric mean of hair arsenic concentration decreased from 2.95 mg/kg in 2002 to 1.78 mg/kg in 2006 , when the percentage of the population with levels over 1 mg/kg only decreased from 93.4% in 2002 to 80.5% in 2006 .
Over this four-year period , the population with high arsenic concentrations decreased significantly while there was no obvious change in hair arsenic concentration for people who had relatively low concentrations .
In terms of age distribution , young and old people had higher hair arsenic concentrations than the middle-aged .
All of these results showed that it is difficult to reverse the negative impact of arsenic pollution on human health .
Arsenic pollution has a long-term continuous influence on the health of local residents .
