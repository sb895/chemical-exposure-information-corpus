Occurrence of perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) in the tissues of humans and wildlife is well documented .
In this study , concentrations and distribution of PFOS , perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHS ) , and perfluorobutane sulfonate ( PFBS ) were determined in samples of surface water , fish and bird blood and livers , and human blood collected in Japan .
Notable concentrations of PFOS were found in surface water and fish from Tokyo Bay .
PFOS was found in all of the 78 samples of fish blood and liver analyzed .
Based on the concentrations of PFOS in water and in fish livers , bioconcentration factors were calculated to range from 274 to 41 600 .
Concentrations of PFOS in the blood of Japanese human volunteers ranged from 2.4 to 14 ng/mL .
PFHS was detected in 33% of the fishes analyzed , at concentrations severalfold less than those of PFOS .
