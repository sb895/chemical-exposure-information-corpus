Copper in drinking water has been associated with non-Indian childhood cirrhosis ( NICC ) , a form of liver cirrhosis in childhood .
This epidemiological study examines the exposure of infants to increased copper concentrations through drinking water from public water supplies in southern Lower Saxony , Germany , and whether this dietary copper intake causes liver damage in early childhood .
In total , water samples from 1674 households with infants were tested for copper .
The mean copper concentration was 0.18 mg/L in the 1619 collected stagnation samples and 0.11 mg/L in the 1660 random daytime samples .
There were notable regional differences in copper values .
In 10.3% of all sampled households a copper value of 0.5 mg/L or more was found .
These families were requested to additionally collect 2 composite samples .
An increased level of copper in the drinking water with copper concentrations at or above 0.8 mg/L in the composite samples and a defined minimum ingestion of tap water was followed by a recommendation of a pediatric examination .
Fourteen infants were examined by a pediatrician and of these 11 received a blood serum analysis .
None of the examined infants showed any signs of liver malfunction .
From the results of the study , no indication of a hazard due to copper pipes connected to public water supplies could be found .
