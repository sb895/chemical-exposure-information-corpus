Perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) are persistent environmental contaminants that affect metabolic regulation , inflammation , and other factors implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis ( OA ) .
However , the link between these compounds and OA remains unknown .
In this study , the authors investigated the association of OA with PFOA and PFOS in a population of 49,432 adults from 6 PFOA-contaminated water districts in the mid-Ohio Valley ( 2005-2006 ) .
Participants completed a comprehensive health survey ; serum levels of PFOA , PFOS , and a range of other blood markers were also measured .
Medical history , including physician diagnosis of osteoarthritis , was assessed via self-report .
Analyses included adjustment for demographic and lifestyle characteristics , body mass index , and other potential confounders .
Reported OA showed a significant positive association with PFOA serum levels ( for highest quartile of PFOA vs. lowest , adjusted odds ratio = 1.3 , 95% confidence interval : 1.2 , 1.5 ; P-trend = 0.00001 ) and a significant inverse association with PFOS ( for highest quartile vs. lowest , adjusted odds ratio = 0.8 , 95% confidence interval : 0.7 , 0.9 ; P-trend = 0.00005 ) .
The relation between PFOA and OA was significantly stronger in younger and nonobese adults .
Although the cross-sectional nature of this large , population-based study limits causal inference , the observed strong , divergent associations of reported OA with PFOA and PFOS may have important public health and etiologic implications and warrant further investigation .
