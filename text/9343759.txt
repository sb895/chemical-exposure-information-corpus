The purpose of this study was to determine if hair nicotine and cotinine levels reflect relative exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) in subjects who worked in the hospitality industry , where public smoking was permitted .
Hair samples from 26 subjects were analyzed by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry techniques for nicotine and cotinine .
An exposure gradient was shown for nicotine but not cotinine .
Among nonsmokers , those working in bars where there are no public smoking restrictions had the highest hair nicotine levels , which were close to levels found in smokers .
Nicotine measured in hair is useful as a biological marker for exposure to ETS from multiple sources .
Bar workers in particular are exposed to high levels of ETS , which may adversely affect the health of nonsmokers .
