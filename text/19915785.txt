The extent of human exposure to mercury in some individuals in Ghana was evaluated by analysing samples of human head hair for total mercury and methylmercury .
The average level of total mercury was 0.843 microg g(-1) ( in range of 0.119-4.140 , n = 123 ) and that of methylmercury was 0.787 microg g(-1) ( in range of 0.208-1.847 , n = 42 ) .
Mercury was present in the hair samples almost completely in the methylated form .
The average percentage ratio of methylmercury to total mercury was 97.2% ( in range of 88.5%-107.6% ) .
The results of this study indicate low levels of exposure to methylmercury and does not pose a significant risk to the individuals and to a greater extent the general population .
