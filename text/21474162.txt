The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( dl-PCBs ) and polybrominated diphenylethers ( PBDEs ) in 33 breast milk samples collected in 2006-2007 from primipara mothers close to four industrial areas of Slovak Republic were determined .
The total PCDDs/PCDFs and dl-PCBs expressed as TEQ based on WHO TEFs 1998 in breast milk samples varied from 5.0 to 51.8 pg g(-1) fat ( median : 13.1 pg g(-1) fat ; mean : 18.0 pg g(-1) fat ) .
The measurements of seven PBDE congeners ( IUPAC No. 28 , 47 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 154 , and 183 ) were performed for the first time in human milk from Slovakia .
PBDE levels ranged between 0.22 and 1.62 ng g(-1) fat , with median and mean value of 0.43 ng g(-1) fat and 0.57 ng g(-1) fat respectively .
No statistically significant differences were observed between studied areas in total PBDE concentrations .
Furthermore , this study presents first results concerning the daily intake ( DI ) of PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like compounds for the most vulnerable breast-fed infant population in Slovakia .
The total PCDD/PCDF and dl-PCB DI for an infant during the first 2 months of life was estimated in a range from 14.4 to 230 pg TEQ kg(-1)b.w. , with a median value of 58.9 pg TEQ kg(-1)b.w. .
The DI values substantially exceeded the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) 1-4 pg TEQ kg(-1)b.w. recommended by WHO .
The dietary infant intake concerning PBDEs was estimated to be between 0.69 and 7.1 ng kg(-1)b.w.d(-1) , with median value of 1.7 ng kg(-1)b.w.d(-1) .
