Diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) and di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) are used extensively in personal care products , including fragrances ( DEP ) and nail polish ( DnBP ) .
Between May 2003 and July 2006 , we gathered questionnaire data on the use of seven product categories ( deodorant , perfume , hair spray , hair gel , nail polish/polish remover , liquid soap/body wash , and lotion/mist ) over 48\u2009h during the third trimester of pregnancy from 186 inner-city women .
A 48-h personal air sample was collected and analyzed for DEP and DnBP ; a maternal spot urine sample was collected and analyzed for their monoester metabolites , monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) and mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MnBP ) , respectively .
In all , 97% of air samples and 84% of urine samples were collected within Â±2 days of the questionnaire .
During the 48\u2009h , 41% of women reported perfume use and 10% reported nail polish/polish remover use .
In adjusted analyses , no association was seen between nail product use and air DnBP or urine MnBP concentrations .
Women reporting perfume use had 2.3 times higher ( 95% CI 1.6 , 3.3 ) urinary MEP concentrations .
Personal air DEP increased by 7% for each 25% increase in a composite indicator of the six other product categories ( P<0.05 ) , but was not associated with perfume use .
Air DEP was correlated with urine MEP concentrations only among non-perfume users ( r=0.51 , P<0.001 ) .
Results suggest that perfume use is a significant source of DEP exposure .
