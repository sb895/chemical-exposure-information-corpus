There is evidence indicating that ingestion of arsenic may predispose the development of diabetes mellitus in arsenic-endemic areas in Taiwan .
However , the prevalence of diabetes and related vascular diseases in the entire southwestern arseniasis-endemic and nonendemic areas remains to be elucidated .
We used the National Health Insurance Database for 1999-2000 to derive the prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes and related vascular diseases by age and sex among residents in southwestern arseniasis-endemic and nonendemic areas in Taiwan .
The study included 66,667 residents living in endemic areas and 639,667 in nonendemic areas , all greater than or equal to 25 years of age .
The status of diabetes and vascular diseases was ascertained through disease diagnosis and treatment prescription included in the reimbursement claims of clinics and hospitals .
The prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes , age- and gender-adjusted to the general population in Taiwan , was 7.5% ( 95% confidence interval , 7.4-7.7% ) in the arseniasis-endemic areas and 3.5% ( 3.5-3.6% ) in the nonendemic areas .
Among both diabetics and nondiabetics , higher prevalence of microvascular and macrovascular diseases was observed in arseniasis-endemic than in the nonendemic areas .
Age- and gender-adjusted prevalence of microvascular disease in endemic and nonendemic areas was 20.0% and 6.0% , respectively , for diabetics , and 8.6% and 1.0% , respectively , for nondiabetics .
The corresponding prevalence of macrovascular disease was 25.3% and 13.7% for diabetics , and 12.3% and 5.5% for nondiabetics .
Arsenic has been suggested to increase the risk of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and its related micro- and macrovascular diseases .
