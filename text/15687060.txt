The Children's Post-Pesticide Application Exposure Study ( CPPAES ) was conducted to look at the distribution of chlorpyrifos within a home environment for 2 weeks after a routine professional crack-and-crevice application and to determine the amount of the chlorpyrifos that is absorbed by a child living within the home .
Ten residential homes with a 2- to 5-year-old child in each were selected for study , and the homes were treated with chlorpyrifos .
Pesticide measurements were made from the indoor air , indoor surfaces , and plush toys .
In addition , periodic morning urine samples were collected from each of the children throughout the 2-week period .
We analyzed the urine samples for 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol , the primary urinary metabolite of chlorpyrifos , and used the results to estimate the children's absorbed dose .
Average chlorpyrifos levels in the indoor air and surfaces were 26 ( pretreatment)/120 ( posttreatment ) ng/m3 and 0.48 ( pretreatment)/2.8 ( posttreatment ) ng/cm2 , respectively , reaching peak levels between days 0 and 2 ; subsequently , concentrations decreased throughout the 2-week period .
Chlorpyrifos in/on the plush toys ranged from 7.3 to 1,949 ng/toy postapplication , with concentrations increasing throughout the 2-week period , demonstrating a cumulative adsorption/absorption process indoors .
The daily amount of chlorpyrifos estimated to be absorbed by the CPPAES children postapplication ranged from 0.04 to 4.8 microg/kg/day .
During the 2 weeks after the crack-and-crevice application , there was no significant increase in the amount of chlorpyrifos absorbed by the CPPAES children .
