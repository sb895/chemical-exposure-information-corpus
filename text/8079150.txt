Total mercury concentration in hair , sampled at delivery , was determined in women living in an area polluted with atmospheric emissions of mercury from a metal smelter , ( n = 122 ) and in a control area ( n = 75 ) .
Information on fish consumption was obtained at the 10th week of pregnancy .
The average mercury concentration in hair was 0.27 mg/kg ( range 0.07-0.96 mg/kg ) , which is somewhat lower than previously reported for pregnant women in Sweden and very low compared with levels in fish-eating populations in other parts of the world .
Women living in the polluted area had significantly lower mercury levels in hair than women in the control area when comparing groups with quantitatively similar consumption of freshwater fish .
Possibly , the population in the smelter area does not catch fish in the neighbourhood and/or the fish in the control area has elevated mercury levels .
Consumption of freshwater fish > or = once a week resulted in approximately twice as high hair mercury levels as in those who did not eat freshwater fish at all .
Also consumption of saltwater fish > or = once a week resulted in significantly higher hair mercury levels than in those consuming saltwater fish < once a month .
Hair levels from the 10th week of pregnancy were similar to the levels at delivery in women with high ( > or = once a week ) consumption of freshwater fish but decreased during this period in women who did not eat freshwater fish at all , which could be explained by decreased exposure during pregnancy and measurement in recently formed hair .
