The Alvarado Lagoon System ( ALS ) is located within the Papaloapan River Basin in southern Veracruz , Mexico .
The ALS is a shallow system ( 2 m ) connected to the Gulf of Mexico through a narrow sea channel .
There are a large number of riverbank communities within the ALS that are dependent upon its biological productivity for comestible and economic subsistence .
The purpose of this project was to determine the levels of mercury in water , sediment , fish , and hair samples from within the Papaloapan River Basin and to characterize the risk of Hg exposure to the individuals that reside in these communities .
Water and fish samples were collected during the wet ( September 2005 ) and dry ( March 2003 and 2005 ) seasons .
Hair samples , dietary surveys , and sediment samples were obtained during the wet and dry seasons of 2005 .
Total Hg in the water column ranged from 1.0 to 12.7 ng/L .
A strong correlation ( R(2)=0.82 ; p<0.001 ) between total Hg and total suspended solids in the water column suggests that particulate matter is a transport mechanism for Hg within the lagoon system .
Total Hg in the sediments ranged from 27.5 to 90.5 ng Hg/g dry weight with no significant difference between the 2005 wet and dry seasons .
There was a mild , but significant , correlation between total Hg and % carbon for the March 2005 sediment samples ( R(2)=0.435 ; p=0.020 ) , suggesting that Hg is associated with organic matter on the solid phase .
Concentrations of total Hg in fish and shellfish harvested from the ALS ranged from 0.01 to 0.35 microg Hg/g wet .
The levels of total Hg in hair ranged from 0.10 to 3.36 microg Hg/g ( n=47 ) and 58% of the samples were above 1.00 microg Hg/g .
The findings from this study suggest that individuals who frequently consume fish and shell fish containing low levels of Hg ( <0.3 microg/g ) can accumulate low to moderate body burdens of Hg , as indicated by hair Hg concentrations>1.0 microg/g , and may be at risk for experiencing low dose mercury toxicity .
