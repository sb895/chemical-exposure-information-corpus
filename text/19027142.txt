Arsenic ( As ) poisoning has become a worldwide public health concern .
The skin is quite sensitive to As and skin lesions are the most common and earliest nonmalignant effects associated to chronic As exposure .
In 2005-2007 , a survey was carried out on surface and groundwater arsenic contamination and relationships between As exposure via the drinking water and related adverse health effects ( melanosis and keratosis ) on villagers resides on the banks of Manchar lake , southern part of Sindh , Pakistan .
We screened the population from arsenic-affected villages , 61 to 73% population were identified patients suffering from chronic arsenic toxicity .
The effects of As toxicity via drinking water were estimated by biological samples ( scalp hair and blood ) of adults ( males and females ) , have or have not skin problem ( n=187 ) .
The referent samples of both genders were also collected from the areas having low level of As ( <10 microg/L ) in drinking water ( n=121 ) .
Arsenic concentration in drinking water and biological samples were analyzed using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry .
The range of arsenic concentrations in lake surface water was 35.2-158 microg/L , which is 3-15 folds higher than World Health Organization [ WHO , 2004 .
Guidelines for drinking-water quality third ed. , WHO Geneva Switzerland. ] .
It was observed that As concentration in the scalp hair and blood samples were above the range of permissible values 0.034-0.319 microg As/g for hair and <0.5-4.2 microg/L for blood .
The linear regressions showed good correlations between arsenic concentrations in water versus hair and blood samples of exposed skin diseased subjects ( R2=0.852 and 0.718 ) as compared to non-diseased subjects ( R2=0.573 and 0.351 ) , respectively .
