Arsenic is a potent environmental pollutant that has caused one of the largest public health poisonings in the history of human civilization , affecting tens of millions of people worldwide especially in Bangladesh .
Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) in blood plays an important role in predicting cell or organ damage and as an important clue to the diagnosis of a variety of cancers .
However , effect of chronic arsenic exposure on the LDH level in blood has not yet been documented .
Since the chronic arsenic exposure is associated with organ damages and multi-site cancers , this research aimed at assaying the plasma level of LDH activity in the population who were exposed to arsenic chronically in Bangladesh .
A total of 185 individuals living in arsenic-exposed areas and 121 individuals living in non-exposed area in Bangladesh were recruited as study subjects .
Arsenic content in drinking water , hair and nails were estimated by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy ( ICP-MS ) and LDH activity was assayed by a spectrophotometer .
Significant increase in LDH activity was observed with increasing concentrations of arsenic in water , hair and nails .
Further , the study subjects were split into four groups based on the three ways of each exposure metrics ( water , hair and nail arsenic concentrations ) where the study subjects in the non-exposed area were used as a reference ( lowest exposure ) group .
LDH activity was found to be increased in the higher exposure groups of water and hair arsenic concentrations .
LDH activity was also increased at low to medium exposure groups of nail arsenic concentrations.Thus , the elevated plasma LDH activity might be helpful for the early prognosis of organ or tissue damage in the individuals who were exposed to arsenic chronically .
