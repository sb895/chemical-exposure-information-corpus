Several follow-up studies have assessed lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer ( LHC ) among workers with potential exposure to 1,3-butadiene .
These investigations of the styrene-butadiene rubber and butadiene manufacturing industries include 17,448 subjects with an average of 22 years of follow-up .
When the results of the studies are combined , the total number of observed leukemia deaths is 36 , compared with 34.2 expected .
The standardized mortality ratio is 1.05 , with a 95% confidence interval of 0.74-1.46 .
These null data are compatible with , at most , a weak positive association of butadiene with leukemia .
There is little evidence of an association with other forms of LHC among styrene-butadiene rubber workers ( 55 observed/50.1 expected deaths ) .
Only one study has evaluated directly the relation between estimates of butadiene exposure and leukemia , and this investigation reports a positive association .
The result , however , cannot be interpreted as causal , because there is no satisfactory explanation for the marked discrepancy between this case-control study and a null follow-up study based on the same subjects .
Overall , the epidemiologic evidence does not provide persuasive evidence that butadiene exposure causes LHC .
