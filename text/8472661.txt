A computer-administered neurobehavioral evaluation system in a Chinese language version ( NES-C ) and a mood inventory of the profile of mood states ( POMS ) were applied to assess the psychological effects of low-level exposure to mercury vapor in a group of 88 workers ( 19 males and 69 females , with mean age of 34.2 years ) exposed to mercury vapor ( average duration of exposure 10.4 years ) .
The well-matched group of 97 nonexposed workers was treated as the control .
The intensity of current mercury vapor was relatively mild as reflected by the average level of mercury in the air of the workplace ( 0.033 mg/m3 ) and in urine ( 0.025 mg/liter ) .
The results indicated that the profile of mood states posed was moving to the negative side in Hg-exposed group and most of the NES-C performances , in particular , the mental arithmetic , two-digit search , switching attention , visual choice reaction time , and finger tapping , were also significantly affected compared with those obtained from controls ( P < 0.05-0.01 ) .
The present study and the previous study on the validation of the system suggest that the NES-C we developed is valid for the neurotoxicity screening among the working population exposed to neurotoxic agents .
