The health implications of the consumption of high arsenic groundwater in Bangladesh and West Bengal are well-documented , however , little is known about the level of arsenic exposure elsewhere in Southeast Asia , where widespread exploitation of groundwater resources is less well established .
We measured the arsenic concentrations of nail and hair samples collected from residents of Kandal province , Cambodia , an area recently identified to host arsenic-rich groundwaters , in order to evaluate the extent of arsenic exposure .
Nail and hair arsenic concentrations ranged from 0.20 to 6.50 microg g(-1) ( n=70 ) and 0.10 to 7.95 microg g(-1) ( n=40 ) , respectively , in many cases exceeding typical baseline levels .
The arsenic content of the groundwater used for drinking water purposes ( 0.21-943 microg L(-1) ( n=31) ) was positively correlated with both nail ( r=0.74 , p<0.0001 ) and hair ( r=0.86 , p<0.0001 ) arsenic concentrations .
In addition , the nail and hair samples collected from inhabitants using groundwater that exceeded the Cambodian drinking water legal limit of 50 microg L(-1) arsenic contained significantly more arsenic than those of individuals using groundwater containing <50 microg L(-1) arsenic .
X-ray absorption near edge structure ( XANES ) spectroscopy suggested that sulfur-coordinated arsenic was the dominant species in the bulk of the samples analysed , with additional varying degrees of As(III)-O character .
Tentative linear least squares fitting of the XANES data pointed towards differences in the pattern of arsenic speciation between the nail and hair samples analysed , however , mismatches in sample and standard absorption peak intensity prevented us from unambiguously determining the arsenic species distribution .
The good correlation with the groundwater arsenic concentration , allied with the relative ease of sampling such tissues , indicate that the arsenic content of hair and nail samples may be used as an effective biomarker of arsenic intake in this relatively recently exposed population .
