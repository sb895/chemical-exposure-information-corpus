Pattern visual , brainstem auditory , and somatosensory evoked potential ( EP ) studies were performed on 26 chloralkali workers .
The intensity of mercury vapor exposure in these workers was estimated from the individual working history .
Mercury levels in blood , urine , and hair were determined with atomic absorption spectrometry .
The EP findings were compared with those from individually matched normal subjects .
In brainstem auditory and somatosensory EP studies , prolonged neural conduction times in the central nervous system ( CNS ) were found in workers exposed to mercury vapor .
In the pattern visual EP study , mercury workers had higher interpeak amplitudes .
Findings of this study suggested that chronic exposure to mercury vapor would affect the CNS functions .
A multimodality EP study is a useful adjunct in evaluation of chronic mercury neurotoxicity , especially in an epidemiological study .
