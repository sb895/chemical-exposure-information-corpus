The relationships between occupational risk factors in France and bladder cancer were assessed from a hospital-based case-control study conducted between 1984 and 1987 in five regions representing various industries , including mining , textile manufacture , metallurgy and the production of rubber and chemicals .
The study concerned 765 cases ( 658 men and 107 women ) and the same number of controls .
Odds ratios ( OR ) adjusted for matching variables ( age , place of residence and hospital ) , and tobacco smoking were estimated by unconditional logistic regression .
A significantly increased risk of bladder cancer was observed among men employed in coal mining ( OR = 2.42 ; 95% confidence interval ( Cl ) : 1.25-4.67 ) and the chemicals industry ( OR = 2.36 ; 95% Cl : 1.23-4.53 ) .
Aircraft and ship's officers ( OR = 11.8 ; 95% Cl : 1.46-95.7 ) , managers ( OR = 1.64 ; 95% Cl : 1.11-2.43 ) and street vendors ( OR = 3.60 ; 95% Cl : 1.15-11.3 ) also had an increased risk .
Among women , employment in the clothing industry was associated with a high OR ( = 3.21 ; 95% Cl : 1.34-7.71 ) .
Assessment of individual exposures by a panel of industrial hygiene experts showed that significantly more cases than controls had been exposed to the following substances : chlorinated solvents ( OR = 1.86 ; 95% Cl : 1.19-2.90 ) , industrial oils and greases ( OR = 1.44 ; 95% Cl : 1.10-1.89 ) , welding fumes ( OR = 1.40 ; 95% Cl : 0.98-2.01 ) , coal dust ( OR = 1.71 ; 95% Cl : 1.02-2.89 ) and metallic oxide dust ( OR = 2.99 ; 95% Cl : 1.12-8.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
