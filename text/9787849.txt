BACKGROUND Occupational , environmental , or experimental exposure of people , animals , and cell cultures to radon has been the subject of numerous studies .
The present study comprised 120 miners , occupationally exposed to radon and heavy metals in a Pb-Zn mine ; 57 female subjects environmentally exposed ( control group 1 ) ; and 100 subjects from the urban population ( control group 2 ) .
METHODS Radon measurements were performed , and the effective equivalent radiation doses over a 2-year period were calculated .
The following end points were studied : conventional analysis of structural chromosomal aberrations , micronuclei , and sister chromatid exchanges ( SCE ) .
RESULTS The mean values of the percentage of structural chromosomal aberration frequency were 4.09% in miners , 1.43% in control group 1 , and 1.88% in control group 2 .
The difference in frequencies was statistically significant ( AV/FP 0.000 ) .
The frequency of micronuclei was 13.00 +/- 3.54 per 500 CB cell in miners and 6.4 +/- 2.11 per 500 CB cells in control subjects ( AV/FP 0.000 ) .
The frequency of SCE was 7.97 per cell in miners ( range 6.2-13.1 ) and 6.17 and 6.63 for the two control groups , respectively ( AV/FP 0.000 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Comparative analysis of the cytogenetic results for all three groups showed significant differences between the miners and the two control groups .
The findings of this study need to be interpreted with regard to simultaneous exposure to radon and metals , i.e. , lead , cadmium , and zinc .
