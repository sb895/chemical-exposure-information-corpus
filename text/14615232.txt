In this work , we studied the frequency of DNA damage in children living in Villa de la Paz , Mexico , a mining site contaminated with arsenic and lead .
DNA damage in blood cells was assessed using the Comet assay , and the results were compared to those found in children living in a less exposed town ( Matehuala ) .
In Villa de la Paz , high concentrations of arsenic and lead in surface soil and household dust were found .
All of the soil samples had concentrations above 100 mg/kg of arsenic , and 58% of the samples were higher than 400 mg/kg of lead ( these concentrations are used as intervention guidelines by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ) .
In agreement with the environmental results , urinary arsenic in children living in Villa de la Paz ( geometric mean 136 microg/g creatinine ) was significantly higher than that found in children living in Matehuala ( 34 microg/g creatinine ) .
Blood lead levels were also significantly higher in children from Villa de la Paz ( 11.6 microg/dL ) than in children from Matehuala ( 8.3 microg/dL ) .
The results of the Comet assay showed that the tail length and the tail moment in children living in Villa de la Paz were higher than those observed for children in Matehuala ( P<0.05 ) .
Taking all the data into account , our study has shown increased DNA damage in children exposed to arsenic and lead in the mining site of Villa de la Paz .
