Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) are normally the dominant perfluoroalkyl substances ( PFASs ) in human serum , but here a Canadian family of seven was identified with particularly high exposure to perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) .
Disproportionately high serum PFHxS concentrations ( range 27.5-423 ng/mL ) and moderately high PFOS ( range 15.2-108 ng/mL ) and PFOA ( range 2.40-9.23 ng/mL ) concentrations were detected in the family members , with all three chemicals being highest in the youngest children .
We therefore sought to identify the source(s) and pathway(s) of this unusual exposure , and to study the excretion of PFASs for this family .
Serum , urine , and stool were sampled from family members , carpet , dust , and air were sampled in the home , and a questionnaire was administered .
Over 15 years , the family's household carpets were treated 8 times with Scotchgard formulations .
Elevated concentrations of PFHxS were detected in household dust ( 2780 ng/g dust ) and in family room carpet ( 2880 ng/g carpet ) , and the primary mode of excretion for the major PFASs was through urine .
The high PFHxS and moderately high PFOS concentrations in serum and household samples are consistent with the known PFAS content of certain Scotchgard formulations , and exposure was likely through dust ingestion and/or inhalation .
