Mercury concentrations in morning urine and ejaculate were detected in 80 husbands of women presenting for infertility treatment .
Additionally , the number of their dental amalgam fillings was documented .
A routine spermiogram was performed , from which a numerical " fertility index " was calculated .
Urinary mercury concentrations were in the range of non-exposed populations , only minute Hg concentrations were determined in ejaculate , 75% of the semen sample concentrations were under the detection limit of 5 micrograms/l .
In comparison , 7 proven fertile workers with occupational mercury exposure had elevated levels of mercury in their ejaculates ( range 10-65 micrograms/l ) .
No positive correlation could be established between subject mercury concentrations in urine or ejaculate and the quality of their semen , expressed as fertility index .
Equally , no such correlation could be established between the fertility index and the number of their dental amalgam fillings .
From these preliminary data no evidence can be derived for the alleged relation between the mercury burden from dental amalgam fillings and male fertility disorders .
