In 2003 UNIDO ( United Nations Industrial Development Organization ) conducted an environmental and health assessment in a small-scale mining area in Tanzania .
BGS ( British Geological Survey ) performed the environmental assessment .
The Institute of Forensic Medicine - University of Munich performed the health assessment .
The results of the medical , neurological and neuro-psychological examination of 180 participants from the affected area of Rwamagasa and 31 controls were analyzed .
Urine , blood and hair samples were analyzed to detect the level of mercury body burden .
Mercury concentrations in the bio-monitors urine , blood and hair were statistically significantly higher in the exposed population from Rwamagasa compared to the control group from Katoro .
Only amalgam burners showed mercury levels above the toxicological threshold limits .
A speciation of mercury in hair indicated that mainly elemental mercury vapor contributed to the high body burden of the artisanal miners. 104 amalgam-burners , the most exposed population group , were examined. 25 of these workers were found to be intoxicated .
Small-scale mining is a serious health hazard for amalgam burners .
Reduction of the exposure is essential to prevent further damage .
