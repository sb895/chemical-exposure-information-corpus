BACKGROUND Autopsied lungs from 29 hard rock miners were investigated to determine the relationship of the dust content to pathology , radiology , and occupational exposure .
METHODS Each lung was divided horizontally into three sections .
Pathological and radiological studies and chemical analyses were carried out on samples from each section .
The hilar lymph nodes were also studied chemically .
The work history and smoking history were assessed .
The occupational exposure to silica and total dust were estimated .
The effect of smoking was examined , and the relationship between dust content of the lungs to that of the lymph nodes were also investigated .
RESULTS There was a good agreement between radiologic and pathologic findings .
Positive correlations were seen between hydroxyproline ( as an index of fibrosis ) , silica dust , non-silica inorganic dust , radiographic category of pneumoconiosis and pathologic grade of silicosis .
Smokers lost on average 7 years of life compared to non-smokers , but numbers were small and no adjustment was made .
Silica appeared to be concentrated in lungs and lymph nodes compared to the estimates of silica concentration in the mining environment .
Silica in the lymph nodes on average is 2.4-fold higher than in the lungs .
CONCLUSIONS This study of autopsied hard rock miners lungs shows positive relationships between lung dust and hydroxyproline content , radiological and pathological findings .
