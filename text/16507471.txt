We assessed concurrent exposure to a mixture of > 50 environmental chemicals by measuring the chemicals or their metabolites in the blood of 43 ethnically diverse children ( 3-6 years of age ) from a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood in Minneapolis .
Over a 2-year period , additional samples were collected every 6-12 months from as many children as possible .
We analyzed blood samples for 11 volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) , 2 heavy metals ( lead and mercury , 11 organochlorine ( OC ) pesticides or related compounds , and 30 polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) congeners .
The evidence suggests that numerous VOCs originated from common sources , as did many PCBs .
Longitudinal measurements indicate that between-child variance was greater than within-child variance for two VOCs ( benzene , toluene ) , for both heavy metals ( Pb , Hg ) , for all detectable OC pesticides , and for 15 of the measured PCB congeners ( 74 , 99 , 101 , 118 , 138-158 , 146 , 153 , 156 , 170 , 178 , 180 , 187 , 189 , 194 , 195 ) .
Despite the relatively small sample size , highest measured blood levels of 1,4-dichlorobenzene , styrene , m-/p-xylene , Pb , Hg , heptachlor epoxide , oxychlordane , dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene ( p,p -DDE ) , trans-nonachlor , and PCB congeners 74 , 99 , 105 , 118 , 138 , 146 , 153 , 156 , 170 , and 180 were comparable with or higher than 95th percentile measurements of older children and adults from national surveys .
Results demonstrate that cumulative exposures to multiple environmental carcinogens and neurotoxins can be comparatively high for children from a poor inner-city neighborhood .
