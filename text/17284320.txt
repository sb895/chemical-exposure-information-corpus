BACKGROUND Polymorphisms in GSTT1 , GSTM1 and GSTP1 impact detoxification of carcinogens by GSTs and have been reported to increase susceptibility to environmentally related health outcomes .
Individual factors in arsenic biotransformation may influence disease susceptibility .
GST activity is involved in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds , including catalyzing the formation of arsenic-GSH conjugates .
METHODS We investigated whether polymorphisms in GSTT1 , GSTP1 and GSTM1 were associated with risk of skin lesions and whether these polymorphisms modify the relationship between drinking water arsenic exposure and skin lesions in a case control study of 1200 subjects frequency matched on age and gender in community clinics in Pabna , Bangladesh in 2001-2002 .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION GSTT1 homozygous wildtype status was associated with increased odds of skin lesions compared to the null status ( OR1.56 95% CI 1.10-2.19 ) .
The GSTP1 GG polymorphism was associated with greater odds of skin lesions compared to GSTP1 AA , ( OR 1.86 ( 95%CI 1.15-3.00 ) .
No evidence of effect modification by GSTT1 , GSTM1 or GSTP1 polymorphisms on the association between arsenic exposure and skin lesions was detected .
CONCLUSION GSTT1 wildtype and GSTP1 GG are associated with increased risk of skin lesions .
