BACKGROUND Benzene is a common industrial chemical known to induce leukemia and other blood disorders , as well as aneuploidy , in both human blood cells and sperm at exposures > 10 ppm .
Recent reports have identified health effects at exposure levels < 1 ppm , the permissible exposure limit ( PEL ; 8 hr ) set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
OBJECTIVE We investigated whether occupational exposures to benzene near 1 ppm induce aneuploidy in sperm .
METHODS We used multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization to measure the incidence of sperm with numerical abnormalities of chromosomes X , Y , and 21 among 33 benzene-exposed men and 33 unexposed men from Chinese factories .
Individual exposures were assessed using personal air monitoring and urinary concentrations of benzene and trans,trans-muconic acid ( E,E-MA ) .
Air benzene concentrations were not detectable in unexposed men ; in exposed men , concentrations ranged from below the detection limit to 24 ppm ( median , 2.9 ppm ) , with 27% of exposed men ( n = 9 ) having concentrations of <or= 1 ppm .
Exposed men were categorized into low and high groups based on urinary E,E-MA ( median concentrations of 1.9 and 14.4 mg/L , respectively ; median air benzene of 1 and 7.7 ppm , respectively ) , and aneuploidy frequencies were compared with those of unexposed men .
RESULTS Sperm aneuploidy increased across low- and high-exposed groups for disomy X [ incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) = 2.0 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.1-3.4 ; and IRR = 2.8 ; 95% CI , 1.5-4.9 , respectively ] , and for overall hyperhaploidy for the three chromosomes investigated ( IRR = 1.6 ; 95% CI , 1.0-2.4 ; and IRR = 2.3 ; 95% CI , 1.5-3.6 , respectively ) .
We also found elevated disomy X and hyperhaploidy in the nine men exposed to <or= 1 ppm benzene compared with unexposed men ( IRR = 1.8 ; 95% CI , 1.1-3.0 ; and IRR = 2.0 ; 95% CI , 1.1-3.9 , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS Benzene appeared to increase the frequencies of aneuploid sperm for chromosomes associated with chromosomal abnormality syndromes in human offspring , even in men whose air benzene exposure was at or below the U.S. permissible exposure limit .
