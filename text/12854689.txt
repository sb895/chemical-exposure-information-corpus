We report the results of environmental sampling and modeling in a neighborhood adjacent to a wood processing plant .
This plant used creosote and pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) to treat wood for over 70 years .
Between 1999 and 2001 , environmental samples were obtained to quantify the level of environmental contamination from the wood processing plant .
Blood from 10 residents was measured for chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans .
Soil sediment samples from drainage ditches and attic/dust samples from nearby residents ' homes were tested for polychlorinated dioxins , furans , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) .
The dioxin congeners analysis of the 10 residents revealed elevated valued for octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin compatible with PCP as the source .
The levels of carcinogenic PAHs were higher than background levels and were similar to soil contamination on wood preserving sites .
Wipe sampling in the kitchens of 11 homes revealed that 20 of the 33 samples were positive for octachlorinated dioxins with a mean value of 10.27 ng/m2 .
The soil , ditch samples , and positive wipe samples from the homes indicate a possible ongoing route of exposure to the contaminants in the homes of these residents .
Modeled air exposure estimated for the wood processing waste chemicals indicate some air exposure to combustion products .
The estimated air levels for benzo(a)pyrene and tetrachlorodibenzodiozin in this neighborhood exceeded the recommended levels for these compounds in some states .
The quantitative data presented suggest a significant contamination of a neighborhood by wood processing waste chemicals .
These findings suggest the need for more stringent regulations on waste discharges from wood treatment plants .
