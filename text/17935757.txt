This work presents the results of a research concerning the copper content in different types of deciduous teeth ( incisor , canine , molar ) of boys and girls living in the Upper Silesian Industry Region ( Southern Poland ) .
The average copper concentration in deciduous teeth was 9.92 microg/g and was significantly higher in the deciduous teeth of boys ( 12.24 microg/g ) in comparison to the deciduous teeth of girls ( 8.60 microg/g ) .
The concentration of copper was statistically variable depending on the type of tooth ( incisor , canine , molar ) .
The results of the correlation analysis and cluster analysis indicate mainly the participation of lead , iron , manganese and chromium ions in the formation of copper content in hard tissue of deciduous teeth .
