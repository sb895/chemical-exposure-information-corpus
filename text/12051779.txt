French Guiana , like its neighbors , suffers from environmental pollution with methylmercury from gold mining activities , and Amerindian communities are particularly affected .
A neurological and a neurospsychological evaluation were carried out in children of three Amerindian communities with various levels of pollution : 156 children from the Upper Maroni ( high exposure ) , 69 from Camopi on the Oyapock river ( median exposure ) , and 153 from Awala on the Atlantic coast ( low exposure ) .
Exposure to methylmercury was measured by determination of total mercury in the hair of the children and their mothers ( geometric mean , 12.7 microg/g in Upper Maroni ) .
No major neurologic signs were observed in the children examined .
After adjustment for potential confounders , we found a dose-dependent association between maternal hair mercury level and increased deep tendon reflexes , poorer coordination of the legs , and decreased performance in the Stanford-Binet Copying score , which measures visuospatial organization .
In this last test , the frequency of rotation errors was high in the 5-6 years age group and increased with mercury exposure .
These associations depended on the sex of child and were stronger among boys .
The interpretation of these results is limited mainly by the cross-sectional design of the study .
It identifies specific neurological and neuropsychological deficits , in some cases modulated by sex , which are consistent with known targets of mercury neurotoxicity .
