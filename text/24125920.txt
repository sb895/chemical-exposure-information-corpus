Preterm premature rupture of membranes ( PROM ) is the leading identifiable predisposing factor for preterm birth .
Although maternal exposure to air pollution can potentially have an impact on preterm PROM , there is no available evidence on such an impact .
In this study , based on 5,555 singleton births occurring in Barcelona , Spain ( 2002-2005 ) , we investigated the associations of maternal exposure to nitrogen dioxide , nitrogen oxides , and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of \u22642.5 µm ( PM2.5 ) , 2.5 µm-10 µm , and \u226410 µm and PM2.5 light absorption with preterm PROM and gestational age at the rupture of membranes ( ROM ) .
We utilized temporally adjusted land-use regression models to predict pollutant levels at each subject's home address during each week of her pregnancy .
We conducted matched ( according to the length of exposure ) case-control analyses to estimate the preterm PROM risk associated with 1 interquartile-range increase in exposure levels during the entire pregnancy and during the last 3 months prior to ROM .
We found an increase in preterm PROM risk of up to 50% ( 95% confidence interval : 4 , 116 ) and a 1.3-day ( 95% confidence interval : -1.9 , -0.6 ) reduction in gestational age at ROM associated with PM2.5 absorbance , nitrogen dioxide exposure , and nitrogen oxide exposure during the entire pregnancy and the last 3 months prior to ROM .
