Heavy metal pollution is becoming a serious issue in developing countries such as China , and the public is increasingly aware of its adverse health impacts in recent years .
We assessed the potential health risks in a lead-zinc mining area and attempted to identify the key exposure pathways .
We evaluated the spatial distributions of personal exposure using indigenous exposure factors and field monitoring results of water , soil , food , and indoor and outdoor air samples .
The risks posed by 10 metals and the contribution of inhalation , ingestion and dermal contact pathways to these risks were estimated .
Human hair samples were also analyzed to indicate the exposure level in the human body .
Our results show that heavy metal pollution may pose high potential health risks to local residents , especially in the village closest to the mine ( V1 ) , mainly due to Pb , Cd and Hg .
Correspondingly , the residents in V1 had higher Pb ( 8.14 mg/kg ) levels in hair than those in the other two villages .
Most of the estimated risks came from soil , the intake of self-produced vegetables and indoor air inhalation .
This study highlights the importance of site-specific multipathway health risk assessments in studying heavy-metal exposures in China .
