INTRODUCTION Asians , Pacific Islanders , and Native Americans are a potentially high-risk group for dietary exposure to methylmercury through fish consumption .
However , blood mercury levels in this group have not been identified in recent reports of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) for the years 1999-2002 .
METHODS We used NHANES data from 1999-2002 to obtain population estimates of blood mercury levels among women of childbearing age classified as belonging to the " other " racial/ethnic group ( Asian , Pacific Islander , Native American , and multiracial ; n = 140 ) .
Blood mercury levels in this group were compared with those among all other women participants , classified as Mexican American , non-Hispanic black , non-Hispanic white , and " other " Hispanic .
RESULTS An estimated 16.59 +/- 4.0% ( mean +/- SE ) of adult female participants who self-identified as Asian , Pacific Islander , Native American , or multiracial ( n = 140 ) had blood mercury levels > or = 5.8 microg/L , and 27.26 +/- 4.22% had levels > or = 3.5 microg/L .
Among remaining survey participants ( n = 3,497 ) , 5.08 +/- 0.90% had blood mercury levels > or = 5.8 microg/L , and 10.86 +/- 1.45% had levels > or = 3.5 microg/L .
CONCLUSIONS Study subjects in NHANES who self-identified as Asian , Pacific Islander , Native American , or multiracial had a higher prevalence of elevated blood mercury than all other racial/ethnic participants in the survey .
Future studies should address reasons for the high mercury levels in this group and explore possible interventions for lowering risk of methylmercury exposure in this population .
