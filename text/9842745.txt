Twenty primary schools in three areas ( Merebank , Austerville and Bluff ) of south-central Durban , South Africa were studied to determine if dust lead loading ( microgram/m2 ) is high enough to constitute a risk to children .
Atmospheric lead fallout rates in the schools varied from 9 to 264 micrograms/m2 per day and were higher than the values now being reported in the developed countries .
Mean outside dust lead loadings were 425 micrograms/m2 in Merebank , 771 micrograms/m2 in Austerville and 1174 micrograms/m2 in Bluff areas , and 25% of the primary schools were found to have mean outside dust lead loading above 1000 micrograms/m2 .
Mean dust lead loadings inside classrooms were 2-4 times lower than the outside rates , and showed no significant difference among schools in the three areas .
Dust lead loadings were correlated with lead concentrations in dust but not with distance from the highway or with atmospheric lead deposition rates .
Exposure to dust lead in classrooms and in the school yard is considered to be an important contributor to blood lead levels in , and hence a potential health hazard to , children in many urban areas of the city .
