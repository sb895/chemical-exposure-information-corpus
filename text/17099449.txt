OBJECTIVE We investigated whether PM2.5-mediated autonomic modulation depends on individual coronary risk profiles .
METHODS Five-minute average heart rate ( HR ) and heart rate variability ( HRV , including standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals [ SDNN ] , square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals [ rMSSD ] , high frequency [ HF] ) were measured from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms , and personal PM(2.5) exposures were monitored in a prospective study of 10 male boilermakers ( aged 34.3 +/- 8.1 years ) .
We used the Framingham score to classify individuals into low ( score = 1-3 ) and high ( score = 5-6 ) risk categories .
Mixed-effect models were used for statistical analyses .
RESULTS Each 1-mg/m(3) increase in the preceding 4-hour moving average PM(2.5) was associated with HR increase ( 5.3 beats/min ) and HRV reduction ( 11.7% , confidence interval [ CI ] = 6.2-17.1% for SDNN ; 11.1% , CI = 3.1-19.1% for rMSSD ; 16.6% , CI = 1.5-31.7% for HF ) .
Greater responses ( 2- to 4-fold differences ) were observed in high-risk subjects than in low-risk subjects .
CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that adverse autonomic responses to metal particulate are aggravated in workers with higher coronary risk profiles .
