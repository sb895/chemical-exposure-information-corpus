Perfluorooctanesulfonylfluoride ( POSF)-based compounds have been manufactured and used in a variety of industrial applications .
These compounds degrade to perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) which is regarded as a persistent end-stage metabolite and is found to accumulate in tissues of humans and wildlife .
PFOS , perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) , perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , and perfluorooctanesulfonamide ( PFOSA ) have been found in human sera from the United States .
In this study , concentrations of PFHxS , perfluorobutanesulfonate ( PFBS ) , PFOS , perfluorohexanoic acid ( PFHxA ) , PFOA , perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) , perfluorodecanoic acid ( PFDA ) , perfluoroundecanoic acid ( PFUnDA ) , perfluorododecanoic acid ( PFDoDA ) , and PFOSA were measured in 85 samples of whole human blood collected from nine cities ( eight provinces ) in China , including Shenyang ( Liaoning ) , Beijing ( Hebei ) , Zhengzhou ( Henan ) , Jintan ( Jiangsu ) , Wuhan ( Hubei ) , Zhoushan ( Zhejiang ) , Guiyang ( Guizhou ) , Xiamen ( Fujian ) , and Fuzhou ( Fujian ) .
Among the 10 perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) measured , PFOS was the predominant compound .
The mean concentration of PFOS was greatest in samples collected from Shenyang ( 79.2 ng/mL ) and least in samples from Jintan ( 3.72 ng/mL ) .
PFHxS was the next most abundant perfluorochemical in the samples .
No age-related differences in the concentrations of PFOA , PFOS , PFOSA , and PFHxS were observed .
Gender-related differences were found,with males higher for PFOS and PFHxS , and females higher in PFUnDA .
Concentrations of PFHxS were positively correlated with those of PFOS , while concentrations of PFNA , PFDA , and PFUnDA were positively correlated with those of PFOA .
There were differences in the concentration profiles ( percentage composition ) of various PFCs in the samples among the nine cities .
