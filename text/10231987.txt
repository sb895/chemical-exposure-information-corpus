Through 1996 into 1997 , a spot investigation on mercury contamination was conducted three times in Tanzania , especially around the Lake Victoria .
A total of 150 goldminers , 103 fishermen and their families , and 19 residents of Mwanza City volunteered for the current study .
A high total mercury level of 48.3 ppm ( near to 50 ppm , a critical level of Minamata disease ) and over in the head hair was observed in six goldminers ( highest value , 953 ppm ) , four fishermen and their families ( highest value , 416 ppm ) , and four Mwanza people ( highest value , 474 ppm ) .
With the exception of these 14 subjects , however , each mean total mercury level was well within the normal range ( below 10 ppm ) .
Out of the goldminers examined , 14 cases were diagnosed as a mild form of inorganic-mercury poisoning according to their clinical symptoms ( such as polyneuropathy mercurialis , neuroasthemia , or tremor mercurialis ) and the low ratio of methylmercury to total mercury , whereas neither inorganic-mercury poisoning nor methylmercury poisoning ( Minamata disease ) was noted in the fishermen and their families or in the Mwanza people .
In addition , some subjects who showed a high total mercury level made habitual use of toilet soap containing much mercury .
The findings obtained suggest that the mercury pollution in Tanzania is not very serious , however , it should be observed continuously .
