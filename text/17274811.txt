BACKGROUND Exposure to arsenic concentrations in drinking water in excess of 300 microg/L is associated with diseases of the circulatory and respiratory system , several types of cancer , and diabetes ; however , little is known about the health consequences of exposure to low-to-moderate levels of arsenic ( 10-100 microg/L ) .
METHODS A standardized mortality ratio ( SMR ) analysis was conducted in a contiguous six county study area of southeastern Michigan to investigate the relationship between moderate arsenic levels and twenty-three selected disease outcomes .
Disease outcomes included several types of cancer , diseases of the circulatory and respiratory system , diabetes mellitus , and kidney and liver diseases .
Arsenic data were compiled from 9251 well water samples tested by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality from 1983 through 2002 .
Michigan Resident Death Files data were amassed for 1979 through 1997 and sex-specific SMR analyses were conducted with indirect adjustment for age and race ; 99% confidence intervals ( CI ) were reported .
RESULTS The six county study area had a population-weighted mean arsenic concentration of 11.00 microg/L and a population-weighted median of 7.58 microg/L .
SMR analyses were conducted for the entire six county study area , for only Genesee County ( the most populous and urban county ) , and for the five counties besides Genesee .
Concordance of results across analyses is used to interpret the findings .
Elevated mortality rates were observed for both males ( M ) and females ( F ) for all diseases of the circulatory system ( M SMR , 1.11 ; CI , 1.09-1.13 ; F SMR , 1.15 ; CI , 1.13,-1.17 ) , cerebrovascular diseases ( M SMR , 1.19 ; CI , 1.14-1.25 ; F SMR , 1.19 ; CI , 1.15-1.23 ) , diabetes mellitus ( M SMR , 1.28 ; CI , 1.18-1.37 ; F SMR , 1.27 ; CI , 1.19-1.35 ) , and kidney diseases ( M SMR , 1.28 ; CI , 1.15-1.42 ; F SMR , 1.38 ; CI , 1.25-1.52 ) .
CONCLUSION This is some of the first evidence to suggest that exposure to low-to-moderate levels of arsenic in drinking water may be associated with several of the leading causes of mortality , although further epidemiologic studies are required to confirm the results suggested by this ecologic SMR analysis .
