BACKGROUND This cross-sectional study explores associations between preterm delivery and demographic , clinical and occupational characteristics of women employed within a university and health system .
METHODS A comprehensive surveillance system linking individual-level data from Human Resources , medical insurance claims and a job-exposure matrix was used to identify women with a single live birth between 2001 and 2004 and describe maternal characteristics during pregnancy .
RESULTS Preterm delivery occurred in 7.1% ( n = 74 ) of the 1,040 women , a lower preterm delivery prevalence than observed in the general U.S. population .
Nearly all ( >99.5% ) women utilized prenatal care services .
Prevalence of preterm delivery was highest for inpatient nurses , nurses ' aides and office staff .
In multivariate analyses , preterm delivery was positively associated with several clinical conditions : placenta previa , diabetes and cardiovascular disorder/disease .
CONCLUSIONS We observed associations between preterm delivery and several previously indicated clinical conditions .
Further study of the effect of job characteristics on preterm delivery is warranted .
