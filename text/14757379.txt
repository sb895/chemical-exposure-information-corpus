A study was conducted with the objective of assessing how dietary , occupational , and residential exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) contribute to body burden among pregnant Mohawk women residing near three hazardous waste sites .
From 1992 to 1995 , 111 pregnant women were interviewed about fish consumption and other environmental risk factors and donated a 20-mL venous blood sample for serum PCB analysis .
To supplement previous fish sampling , samples of residential soil , ambient air , wild duck , and local meats and vegetables were also collected and analyzed for PCBs .
The results indicated a significant decline in local fish consumption from an annual mean of 31.3 meals more than 1 year prior to pregnancy to an annualized mean of 11.7 meals during pregnancy .
This change was reportedly a result of the advisories issued against consumption of local fish by pregnant and nursing women of childbearing age .
The geometric mean concentration of total PCBs in the serum was 1.2 ppb , a level that is similar to that in other studies of women with no unusual exposures to PCBs .
However , multiple regression analysis revealed that serum levels of total PCBs and three individual congeners were associated with local fish consumption .
The PCB levels in soil , air , and local foodstuffs other than fish generally were not elevated , except for those obtained in close proximity to one of the hazardous waste sites , and no association was found between serum PCB levels and exposure through these media or through occupation .
