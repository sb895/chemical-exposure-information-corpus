Perfluoroalkyl substances are manmade chemicals used in many consumer products and have become ubiquitous in the environment .
Animal studies and a limited number of human studies have demonstrated developmental effects in offspring exposed to perfluoroalkyl substances in utero , but the implications of timing of in utero exposure have not been systematically investigated .
The present study investigated variation in perfluorocarbon levels of 9952 women of childbearing age who had been exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) in drinking water contaminated by industrial waste .
An analysis of variance with contrast was performed to compare the levels of PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid ( PFOS ) in pregnant and nonpregnant women overall and during each trimester of pregnancy .
We found that pregnant women had lower circulating PFOA and PFOS concentrations in peripheral blood than nonpregnant women and that PFOA levels were consistently lower throughout all trimesters for pregnancy , suggesting transfer to the fetus at an early stage of gestation .
These results are discussed in the context of the endocrine-disrupting properties of perfluoroalkyl substances that have been characterized in animal and human studies .
Our conclusion is that further , systematic study of the potential implications of intrauterine perfluorocarbon exposure during critical periods of fetal development is urgently needed .
