Indoor air pollution can be an important risk factor for human health , considering that people spend more than 60% of their time indoors .
Fifty percent of the world population and approximately 90% of the rural population in developing countries are using biomass as energy source .
Latin America represents 12% of the global consumption of biomass ; in Mexico , 27 million people use wood as an energy source .
Therefore , in this study we evaluated a 3-stage risk reduction program .
The stages were : 1 ) removal of indoor soot adhered to roofs and internal walls ; 2 ) paving the dirt floors ; and 3 ) introduction of a new wood stove with a metal chimney that expels smoke outdoors .
The complete intervention program was applied .
In 20 healthy subject residents from an indigenous community in San Luis PotosÃ­ , Mexico , we measured blood carboxyhemoglobin ( % COHb ) , DNA damage ( comet assay ) in nucleated blood cells , and urinary 1-OHP levels before and after the program .
Before intervention individuals had a geometric mean COHb level of 4.93% and 53% of the population presented levels above 2.5% considered a safe level .
However , in all the studied individuals the levels of COHb were reduced to below 2.5% ( mean level 1.0% ) one month after the intervention .
Moreover , when compared , DNA damage in people exposed before the intervention was higher ( 5.8+/-1.3 of Tail Moment ) than when the program was introduced ( 2.8+/-0.9 of Tail Moment ) ( P>0.05 ) and a same trend was observed with urinary 1-OHP levels ; 6.71+/-3.58 micromol/mol creatinine was the concentration before intervention ; whereas , 4.80+/-3.29 micromol/mol creatinine was the one after the program .
The results suggest that the intervention program offers an acceptable risk reduction to those families that use biomass for food cooking .
