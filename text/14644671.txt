In this article we report on the effectiveness of a community-based , culture-specific , controlled trial of intensive peer education aimed at preventing lead burden in children 0-36 months of age within a neighborhood with high risk for lead exposure .
Mothers ( n = 594 ) were randomly assigned to control or intervention groups .
Offspring blood lead levels were assessed every 4 months .
All participants received brochures on basic lead prevention strategies .
Intervention participants were offered 20 bi-weekly educational sessions by same-ethnicity peer educators over the course of 1 year , and quarterly booster sessions for 2 years afterward .
The intervention group's educational curriculum included information on lead sources ( e.g. , paint , dust , water , soil , and risks from home repairs and remodeling ) , health consequences of lead burden , and strategies to reduce lead exposure , including household cleaning , hygiene , safe use of water , and nutritional recommendations .
Results indicated that of the 378 children contributing sufficient blood data for analysis , 23% had blood lead levels > 10 micro g/dL before 3 years of age .
Intervention participants were more likely to maintain blood lead levels < 10 micro g/dL than were controls ( 81% vs. 73% ; p = 0.08 ) .
Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the intervention reduced the risk of blood lead levels > 10 micro g/dL by approximately 34% .
We conclude that although intensive education resulted in a lower proportion of children with elevated lead levels , education alone cannot be relied upon to prevent lead burden .
