To conduct a reliable safety assessment , accurate exposure information for cosmetic products and ingredients is needed .
The aim of the present retrospective study was to determine the amount per application and the daily exposure for some of the most commonly used baby cosmetic products .
Consumption data from 48 clinical studies performed on 1481 babies and children ( from 0 to 10 years old ) were reviewed and used to conduct a probabilistic evaluation of dermal exposure .
Six categories of products were reviewed : rinseoff products for hair and body ; rinse-off products for the whole body ; leave-on products for face and body ; cleansers for face and body ; diaper dermatitis treatment products ; shampoos .
Subjects were provided with products and recorded detailed daily usage information over a 1-4-week period , depending on the study .
Products were weighed at the start and upon completion of each study in order to determine the total amount of product used .
The mean , median , standard deviation and 95th percentile were calculated for daily consumption and exposure , for several age groups from 0 to 10 years old .
This study provides current baby cosmetic exposure information for commonly used products which will be useful for risk assessment purposes .
