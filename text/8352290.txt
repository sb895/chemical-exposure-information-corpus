Health care workers may be occupationally exposed to known and suspected teratogens including viruses , anesthetic gases , sterilants , mercury , and x-radiation .
To assess the risk of congenital defects among offspring of health care workers , we analyzed parental occupational histories for 4,915 case babies with congenital defects , registered during the years 1968-1980 by the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) registry , and for 3,027 control babies born without defects during the same period .
Offspring of mothers employed in a nursing occupation during the periconceptional period had a modest excess risk of having at least one congenital defect ( relative risk [ RR ] = 1.42 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] 1.06-1.88 ) ; the offspring were at statistically significant increased risk of having anencephaly or spina bifida ( RR = 2.00 ; 95% CI 1.01-4.30 ) , coarctation of the aorta ( RR = 2.06 ; 95% CI 1.10-3.82 ) , genital system defects ( RR = 1.61 ; 95% CI 1.03-2.53 ) , and urinary system defects ( RR = 3.43 ; 95% CI 1.41-8.34 ) .
These associations were not confounded by maternal age , education , or alcohol consumption .
Offspring of mothers employed in administrative or clerical jobs in the health care industry also had a modest excess risk of defects ( RR = 1.35 ; 95% CI 0.96-1.90 ) , including a statistically significant excess risk of limb defects .
We also found associations between neural tube defects and potential exposure to anesthetic gases and to x-radiation , but each association was based on only three case babies of potentially exposed parents .
We found no associations between defects and paternal health care employment , except for a few individual defects , and these were based on small numbers of exposed subjects .
Only one of five previous studies reviewed found an increased risk of congenital defects among offspring of nurses , but three of the four negative studies had substantially smaller sample sizes than the present study .
Detection bias may be a possible explanation for the apparent excess risk of certain defects among offspring of nurses .
