Styrene is widely used in the production of various plastics , synthetic rubber and resins .
Occupational exposure occurs mainly via inhalation and relatively high exposure occurs due to its use in manual application techniques .
The aim of this study was to evaluate if SO-Hb adducts are a suitable biomarker for assessing occupational exposure to styrene .
Seventy-five reinforced plastic workers and 77 control subjects were studied .
In the selected population the main urinary styrene metabolites and the styrene oxide N-terminal valine ( SO-Hb ) adducts in human globin were quantified .
The levels of SO-Hb adducts were significantly higher ( p<0.01 ) in the exposed subjects ( 5.98pmol/g globin ) when compared with controls ( 2.59pmol/g globin ) and a significant difference was found in levels of SO-Hb adducts between non-smokers and smokers among the control group .
From our data we conclude that SO-Hb adduct measurement is a sensitive and specific means of assessing exposure to styrene at the occupational and environmental level .
