Children attending schools in urban areas with high traffic density are a high risk group for lead poisoning .
We assessed the magnitude of lead exposure in schoolchildren from Jakarta by analyzing blood lead concentrations and biomarkers of heme biosynthesis .
A total of 131 children from four public elementary schools in Jakarta ( two in the southern district and two in the central district ) were enrolled in the study .
To evaluate lead pollution in each area , soil samples and tap water were collected .
The mean blood lead concentration was higher in the central district than in the southern district ( 8.3 +/- 2.8 vs. 6.9 +/- 3.5 microg/100 ml ; p<0.05 ) ; 26.7% of the children had lead levels greater than 10 microg/100 ml .
In 24% of the children , zinc protoporphyrin concentrations were over 70 micromol/mol hemoglobin ; in 17% of the samples , hemoglobin was less than 11 g/100 ml .
All other values were within the physiological range .
Blood lead concentration and hematological biomarkers were not correlated .
Analyses of tap water revealed lead values under 0. 01 mg/l ; lead contamination of soil ranged from 77 to 223 ppm .
Our data indicate that Indonesian children living in urban areas are at increased risk for blood lead levels above the actual acceptable limit .
Activities to reduce pollution ( e.g. , reduction of lead in gasoline ) and continuous monitoring of lead exposure are strongly recommended .
