Our objectives were to determine relative contributions of diet and dust exposure from multiple microenvironments to PentaBDE body burden , and to explore the role of handwipes as a measure of personal exposure to PentaBDE .
We administered a food frequency questionnaire and collected serum , dust ( office , main living area , bedroom , and vehicle ) , and handwipe samples from 31 participants. \u03a3PentaBDEs ( sum of BDE 28/33 , 47 , 99 , 100 , and 153 ) in handwipes collected in the office environment were weakly correlated with dust collected from offices ( r = 0.35 , p = 0.06 ) and bedrooms ( r = 0.39 , p = 0.04 ) , but not with dust from main living areas ( r = -0.05 , p = 0.77 ) or vehicles ( r = 0.17 , p = 0.47). \u03a3PentaBDEs in serum were correlated with dust from main living areas ( r = 0.42 , p = 0.02 ) and bedrooms ( r = 0.49 , p = 0.008 ) , but not with dust from offices ( r = 0.22 , p = 0.25 ) or vehicles ( r = 0.20 , p = 0.41 ) .
Our final regression model included variables for main living area dust and handwipes , and predicted 55% of the variation in serum \u03a3PentaBDE concentrations ( p = 0.0004 ) .
Diet variables were not significant predictors of \u03a3PentaBDEs in serum .
Our research suggests that exposure to dust in the home environment may be the most important factor in predicting PentaBDE body burden in North Americans , and potential exposure pathways may involve PBDE residues on hands .
