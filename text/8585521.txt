The relation between dermal and respiratory exposure and uptake into the body of captan , measured as 24 hr cumulative tetrahydrophtalimide ( THPI ) dose , was studied among 14 male fruit growers applying pesticides in orchards in the Netherlands .
No contribution of respiratory exposure was observed on THPI in the urine .
Dermal exposure , measured with skin pads , showed a clear relation with THPI in urine when exposure was estimated from exposure on skin pads of ankles and neck .
No relation was found for total dermal exposure , calculated from measured exposure on skin pads of representative skin areas according to models described in the literature .
Determinants of exposure such as use of a cabin on the tractor , use of gloves during mixing and loading , and use of rubber boots also explained THPI in urine very well .
This finding corroborated the findings on measured dermal exposure .
Results indicate that more attention should be paid to skin areas which are suspected to be most permeable for a chemical under study .
It was concluded that dermal exposure data can be linked better to biological monitoring based on empirical findings as gathered in a pilot study on exposure of specific body areas than on estimations of total skin dose .
