Some phthalates , parabens and phenols have shown adverse endocrine disrupting effects in animal studies and are also suspected to be involved in human reproductive problems .
However , knowledge about exposure sources and biomonitoring data in different subsets of populations are still scarce .
Thus , in this study first morning urine samples were collected from 6 to 11 years Danish children and their mothers .
The content of seven parabens , nine phenols and metabolites of eight different phthalates were analysed by LC-MS/MS .
Two parabens , six phenols and metabolites from six phthalate diesters were measurable in more than 50% , 75% and 90% of the participants , respectively .
Thus the children and their mothers were generally exposed simultaneously to a range of phthalates , phenols and parabens .
In general , the levels were low but for several of the compounds extreme creatinine adjusted concentrations 100-500-fold higher than the median level were seen in some participants .
Children were significantly higher exposed to bisphenol A ( BPA ) and some of the phthalates ( DiBP , DnBP , BBzP , DEHP and DiNP ) than their mothers , whereas mothers were higher exposed to compounds related to cosmetics and personal care products such as parabens ( MeP , EtP and n-PrP ) , benzophenone-3 , triclosan and diethyl phthalate .
However , a very high correlation between mothers and their children was observed for all chemicals .
A high individual exposure to one chemical was often associated with a high exposure to other of the chemicals and the possibility of combination effects of multiple simultaneous exposures cannot be excluded .
