It is well established that methylmercury ( MeHg ) and mercury vapor pass the placenta , but little is known about infant exposure via breast milk .
We measured MeHg and inorganic mercury ( I-Hg ) in blood of Swedish mothers ( n = 20 ) and their infants , as well as total mercury ( T-Hg ) in breast milk up to 13 weeks postpartum .
Infant blood MeHg was highly associated with maternal blood MeHg at delivery , although more than twice as high .
Infant MeHg decreased markedly until 13 weeks of age .
Infant blood I-Hg was associated with , and about as high as , maternal blood I-Hg at delivery .
Infant I-Hg decreased until 13 weeks .
In breast milk , T-Hg decreased significantly from day 4 to 6 weeks after delivery but remained unchanged thereafter .
At 13 weeks , T-Hg in breast milk was associated with infant MeHg but not with maternal MeHg .
Conversely , T-Hg in breast milk was associated with maternal I-Hg but not with infant I-Hg .
From the findings of the present study in which the exposure to both MeHg and I-Hg was low , we conclude that the exposure to both forms of mercury is higher before birth than during the breast-feeding period , and that MeHg seems to contribute more than I-Hg to infant exposure postnatally via breast milk .
