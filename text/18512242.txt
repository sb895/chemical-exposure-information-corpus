BACKGROUND Polychlorinated biphenyls and other organochlorines have contaminated the Hudson River and New York/New Jersey Harbor for many decades .
Although body burdens and health effects resulting from exposure to these pollutants have been measured in other populations , little is known about anglers from the lower Hudson area .
METHODS Anglers were recruited from fishing clubs and along piers on the lower Hudson River .
One hundred twenty-five participants provided blood samples and questionnaire information .
Serum was analyzed at Mount Sinai School of Medicine for organochlorines .
RESULTS Mean concentration of total PCB congeners was 4.78 microg/L .
A non-significant adjusted mean difference of -0.59 microg/L was observed between local fish eaters and non-eaters with higher levels among the non-eaters .
Similar negative , but non-significant associations were observed for p,p'-DDT , HCB , and beta-BHC .
For pp'-DDE , and several chlordane residues , levels were higher among anglers reporting local fish consumption , but the difference was statistically significant only for TN .
CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest eating fish from the lower Hudson River and NY/NJ harbor is not associated with an increased body burden of PCBs or most other organochlorines .
