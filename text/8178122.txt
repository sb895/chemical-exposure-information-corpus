In a follow-up study concentrations of cadmium , copper , lead and zinc ( measured by atomic absorption spectrometry ) in scalp hair and toenail clippings of 47 children ( 5-9 years ) were compared with previous values ( 2 years earlier ) .
Family members were also monitored .
Twenty-five of the children selected have had either high hair values of Cd , Cu , Pb or low hair Zn concentrations or combinations of these ( group A ) in the first study .
Control group comprised 22 children ( B ) .
At the follow-up study , there were no more differences between group A and B. Between the first and follow-up study Cd and Pb levels in hair and toenails of group A children declined ( geometric means ; hair Cd : 265 vs. 111 ng/g ; hair Pb : 10.1 vs. 3.8 micrograms/g ; toenail Cd : 720 vs. 335 ng/g ; toenail Pb 18.5 vs. 5.8 micrograms/g ) and hair Zn values increased ( 54 vs. 103 micrograms/g ) .
Fathers of exposed children had more Cd and Pb in hair and toenails than fathers of control children ( hair Cd : 88 vs. 48 ng/g ; hair Pb : 4.4 vs. 1.3 micrograms/g ; toenail Cd : 46 vs. 23 ng/g ; toenail Pb : 1.3 vs. 0.7 microgram/g ) .
No conclusive findings were obtained for Cu .
With respect to heavy metal levels of mothers and brothers and sisters there was no uniform pattern .
Children < 5 years of age are especially prone to higher Cd , Pb exposure and to lower Zn status compare with older children .
