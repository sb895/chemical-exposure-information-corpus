Human breast milk represents the best choice for the nutrition of infants .
It is often used for monitoring human exposures to environmental chemicals .
Uniquely suited to meet human biological needs , breast milk composition , especially fat content , changes significantly with time from delivery .
With the aim to compare the concentration of organochlorine compounds ( OCs ) in colostrum versus mature milk , we obtained samples of fourth-fifth day postpartum milk ( colostrum ) and day-14 postpartum milk ( mature milk ) from 12 women enrolled in the project " Early Childhood Development and PCB Exposure in Slovakia " .
The concentrations of selected organochlorine pesticides and congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were measured using gas chromatography with electron capture detection and reported on lipid adjusted basis .
No significant differences were found between organochlorine levels in colostrum and those in mature milk samples .
A very close correlation was found between the concentrations of organochlorine compounds in colostrum and mature milk ( Spearman correlation coefficient r=0.94-0.98 for PCBs , and r=0.85-0.99 for organochlorine pesticides , p<0.001 for all compounds ) .
The present study concludes that the use of colostrum samples provides a close estimate of the child's exposure to OCs in the early neonatal period and demonstrates that , despite the lower fat content , colostrum specimens are adequate to conduct OC analyses .
