In utero exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) reduces the number of ovarian follicles in rat females and causes permanent effects on rat males .
Little data have been gathered on the associations between PBDEs exposure and birth outcome and female menstruation characteristics in both epidemiological and animal studies .
The aim of this study was to examine how PBDEs in breast milk are associated with infant birth outcome and maternal menstruation characteristics .
Study participants were healthy women recruited from central Taiwan between December 2000 and November 2001 .
Twelve congener levels of PBDEs ( BDE-17 , 28 , 47 , 66 , 85 , 99 , 100 , 138 , 153 , 154 , 183 , 209 ) in 20 breast milk samples were measured by gas chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometer .
The mean level of PBDEs in breast milk was 3.93+/-1.74 ng/g lipid .
The estimated PBDE daily intake for a breastfed infant was 20.6 ng/kg b.w./day after delivery .
After maternal age , pre-pregnant BMI , and parity were adjusted , increased PBDEs in breast milk was related with decreased birth outcome , particularly for birth weight and length , chest circumference , and Quetelet's index of infants .
No significant differences in PBDEs were found between the two groups of menstrual cycle length higher and lower than 30 days after we adjusted for maternal age , pre-pregnant BMI , and parity .
In utero exposure to low doses of PBDEs may result in lower birth weight and short or birth length .
Our findings are limited based on the low doses of PBDEs and the small sampling size .
