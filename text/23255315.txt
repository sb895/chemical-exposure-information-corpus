BACKGROUND Nail salons represent a rapidly growing industry with mainly Vietnamese immigrant workers .
Workers routinely handle nail products containing hazardous compounds , yet have limited accessible information to minimize workplace exposures .
METHODS We conducted a culturally appropriate pilot intervention on workplace chemical exposure reduction strategies .
We trained eight Vietnamese owners , who then trained Vietnamese workers in their salons .
We conducted pre- , mid- , and post-intervention assessments with workers , including an in-person survey and personal air monitoring of volatile compounds .
RESULTS Survey results suggested statistically significant increases for chemical knowledge and behavioral changes in glove and mask use , and a reduced prevalence of nose , throat , and skin irritations .
Air monitoring results showed a net reduction for methyl methacrylate and total volatile organic compounds , but not for toluene .
CONCLUSIONS Worker education disseminated through salon owners to their workers can improve work-related knowledge , behavior , health symptoms , and exposures for select air contaminants , although more research is warranted .
