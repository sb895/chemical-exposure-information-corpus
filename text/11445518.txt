We studied a group of women of reproductive age ( 15-49 years ) who were chronically exposed to arsenic through drinking water to identify the pregnancy outcomes in terms of live birth , stillbirth , spontaneous abortion , and preterm birth .
We compared pregnancy outcomes of exposed respondents with pregnancy outcomes of women of reproductive age ( 15-49 years ) who were not exposed to arsenic-contaminated water .
In a cross-sectional study , we matched the women in both exposed and nonexposed groups for age , socioeconomic status , education , and age at marriage .
The total sample size was 192 , with 96 women in each group ( i.e. , exposed and nonexposed ) .
Of the respondents in the exposed group , 98% had been drinking water containing [ Greater and equal to ] 0.10 mg/L arsenic and 43.8% had been drinking arsenic-contaminated water for 5-10 years .
Skin manifestation due to chronic arsenic exposure was present in 22.9% of the respondents .
Adverse pregnancy outcomes in terms of spontaneous abortion , stillbirth , and preterm birth rates were significantly higher in the exposed group than those in the nonexposed group ( p = 0.008 , p = 0.046 , and p = 0.018 , respectively ) .
