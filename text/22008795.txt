Longitudinal measurements of biomarkers for metals , phthalates , environmental tobacco smoke , organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides , polychlorinated biphenyls , and volatile organic compounds were made in blood and/or urine from a stratified , random sample of more than 100 elementary school-aged children living in an inner-city section of Minneapolis .
Repeated measures of 31 exposure biomarkers indicate that between-child variance ( B-CV ) was greater than within-child variance ( W-CV ) for 8 compounds , B-CV was a significant proportion of total variance for 9 compounds , and variances were homogeneous for 14 compounds .
Among siblings living in the same household , positive correlations were observed for biomarker concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls , organochlorine pesticides , metals , and volatile organic chemicals in blood , and total cotinine in urine .
Biologic markers confirm that children from a low-income , ethnically diverse neighborhood experienced concurrent exposure to a variety of hazardous environmental chemicals during their everyday activities .
Future monitoring studies should examine the nature and magnitude of children's cumulative exposure to both chemical and non-chemical stressors , especially in disadvantaged populations .
