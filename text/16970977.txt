In the Arctic , the traditional diet exposes its people to a very high intake of cadmium because it is highly concentrated in the liver and kidneys of commonly eaten marine mammals .
In one study in Greenland , the cadmium intake was estimated to 182 microg/day/person in the fall and 346 in the spring .
To determine whether the cadmium is accumulated in humans , we analyzed autopsy samples of liver and kidneys from 95 ethnic Greenlanders ( aged 19-89 ) who died from a wide range of causes .
The cadmium concentration in liver ( overall mean 1.97 microg/g wet wt ) appeared to be unrelated to any particular age group , whereas the concentrations in the kidneys peaked in Greenlanders between 40 and 50 years of age ( peak concentration 22.3 microg/g wet wt ) .
Despite the high cadmium levels in the typical Greenlander diet , we found that the cadmium concentrations in livers and kidneys were comparable to those reported from Denmark , Sweden , Australia and Great Britain .
Furthermore , even though the mean cadmium intake from the diet was estimated to be 13-25 times higher in Greenlanders than in Danes , we found similar cadmium levels in the kidneys of both .
Seal livers and kidneys are the main source of cadmium in the diet of Greenlanders , but these tissues are not eaten in Denmark .
Thus , our results suggest that the accumulation of cadmium from Greenlander's marine diet is very low .
