Over 250 adults and children were exposed to chlordane when the wooden building surfaces and soil around an apartment complex were sprayed in 1987 .
Two hundred-sixteen adults had neurobehavioral functions measured and completed questionnaires for symptom frequency , mood status , confounding factors , and medical , rheumatic , and respiratory disorders in 1994 .
Measurements included simple and choice reaction time , balance , blink reflex latency , color vision , cognitive , perceptual motor , memory , and recall functions .
We analyzed 216 exposed and 174 referent adults .
Age , educational level , weight , height , and gender ratio were similar for the exposed and referent groups .
Performance of balance , reaction times , Culture Fair , digit symbol , verbal recall , and trail-making were significantly impaired in exposed persons compared to referents .
Mood-state scores were elevated , as were the frequencies of respiratory , neurobehavioral , and rheumatic symptoms .
In contrast , long-term memory function was similar in both groups , consistent with its status before exposure .
There was no identified bias or confounding factors .
Chlordane exposure was associated with protracted impairment of neurophysiological and psychological functions .
The central nervous system is the most important target of chlorinated cyclodiene insecticides .
Human exposure should be prohibited .
