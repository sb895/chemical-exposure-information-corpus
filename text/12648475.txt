Despite growing concern for possible carcinogenic effects associated with environmental benzene exposure in the general population , few studies exist at parts per billion ( ppb ) levels .
We investigated the existence of a relationship between airborne/biological measurements of benzene exposure ( i.e. , personal/area sampling and unmodified urinary benzene/trans,trans-muconic acid ; t,t-MA ) and micronuclei induction ( cytochalasin B technique ) among exposed chemical laboratory workers ( n=47 ) and traffic wardens ( n=15 ) .
Although urinary t,t-MA ( 106.9+/-123.17 microg/L(urine) ) correlated ( R(2)=0.37 ) with urinary benzene ( 0.66+/-0.99 microg/L(urine) ) , neither biological measurement correlated with environmental benzene exposure ( 14.04+/-9.71 microg/m(3) ; 4.39+/-3.03ppb ) , suggesting that , at ppb level ( 1ppb=3.2 microg/m(3) ) , airborne benzene constitutes a fraction of the total intake .
Traffic wardens and laboratory workers had comparable numbers of micronuclei ( 4.70+/-2.63 versus 5.76+/-3.11 ; n.s. ) , similar to levels recorded in the general population .
With univariate/multivariate analysis , no association was found between micronuclei induction and air/urinary benzene exposure variables .
Notably , among the personal characteristics examined ( including age , gender , smoking , drinking , etc. ) , high body mass index correlated with micronuclei induction while , among females , use of hormonal medication was associated with less micronuclei .
Thus the present study provides no evidence that ppb levels of environmental benzene exposure appreciably affect micronuclei incidence ( against the background of other relevant factors ) .
However , this should not be taken as an argument against efforts aiming to reduce environmental benzene pollution .
