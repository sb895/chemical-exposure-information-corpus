The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) were determined in breast milk from women living in the vicinity of a hazardous waste incinerator ( HWI ) in Catalonia , Spain .
The results were compared with the levels obtained in previous surveys carried out in the same area in 1998 ( baseline study ) , 2002 and 2007 .
The current total concentrations of 2,3,7,8-chlorinated PCDD/Fs in breast milk ranged from 18 to 126 pg g(-1)fat ( 1.1-12. 3 pg WHO2005-TEQPCDD/F ) , while the total levels of PCBs ranged from 27 to 405 pg g(-1)fat(0.7-5.3 pg WHO2005-TEQPCB ) .
In turn , PBDE concentrations ( sum of 15 congeners ) ranged 0.3-5.1 g g(-1)fat , with a mean value of 1.3 ng g(-1)fat .
A general decrease in the concentrations for PCDD/Fs , both planar and total PCBs , and PBDEs in breast milk was observed .
The levels of PCDD/Fs , PCBs , and PBDEs in milk of women living in urban zones were higher than those corresponding to industrial zones ( 41% , 26% , and 8% , respectively ) .
For PCDD/Fs and PCBs , the current decreases are in accordance with the reduction in the dietary intake of these pollutants that we have also observed in recent studies carried out in the same area of study .
