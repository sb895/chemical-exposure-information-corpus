The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) , dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( dl-PCBs ) , and polychlorinated naphthalenes ( PCNs ) were determined in workplace air from eight secondary nonferrous metal processing plants to investigate occupational exposure to these toxic compounds .
The total estimated daily intakes of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs for workers by inhalation in the workplace were in the range of 0.15-9.91 and 0.13-8.59 pg of WHO-TEQ/kg of body weight ( bw ) for moderate and light activities , respectively .
The daily inhalation doses for workers in the workplaces of three investigated plants exceeded the tolerable daily intake recommended by the World Health Organization .
These results indicate that the risk of occupational exposure to dioxins by inhalation in the workplace of plants investigated was considerably high .
For PCNs , the daily inhalation doses for workers in the workplace were in the range of 0.005-4.46 and 0.004-3.87 pg of TEQ/kg of bw for moderate and light activities , respectively , which were lower than those of dioxins .
To identify the source of PCDD/Fs , PCBs , and PCNs in workplace air , their homologue profiles were compared with those in stack gas from the plants investigated .
It was found that significant dioxin contamination in workplace air was mainly attributed to the emission of fugitive gas from smelting furnaces during reclamation processes .
