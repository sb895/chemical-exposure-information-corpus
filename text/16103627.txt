A community-based , dose-response study on arsenic contamination was conducted in three communities in Terai in lowland Nepal .
The arsenic concentration of all the tube wells in use ( n = 146 ) and the prevalence of arsenic-induced skin manifestation among 1,343 ( approximately 80% of the inhabitants ) subjects indicated the existence of a highly contaminated area in Terai .
It was found that overall prevalence of arsenicosis among the subjects > or = 15 years old was 6.9% , which was comparable to those found by the same examiner in arsenic-contaminated areas in Bangladesh , and that males had prevalence a twice as high as females , which could not be explained by the difference in the exposure level .
