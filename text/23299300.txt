The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and specificity of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene ( 1-OHPu ) as a biomarker of the exposure from urban pollution to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) among outdoor workers in a meta-analysis .
Our meta-analysis was performed according to standard methods , and the results show that the concentrations of 1-OHPu tend to be higher in exposed workers than in unexposed workers ( if we exclude two highly heterogeneous articles ) , in exposed non-smokers than in unexposed non-smokers and in exposed than in unexposed workers who were carriers of the CYP1A1 genotype and in those with the glutathione-S-transferase M1 ( -)genotype .
These genotypes enhance the effect of exposure , particularly in non-smokers .
Smoking reduces the differences between exposed and unexposed subjects .
In conclusion , our results suggest that the use of the 1-OHPu biomarker appears to be reliable for studying occupational exposure to PAHs from urban pollution , as long as environmental and behavioural factors are considered .
