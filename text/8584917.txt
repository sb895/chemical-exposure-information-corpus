The level of lead and cadmium in foodstuffs in the Republic of Croatia was determined by the method of atomic absorption spectrophotometry from the beginning of 1988 to mid 1993 .
Mean weekly dietary intake of these toxic metals was then estimated on the basis of the level of contamination and consumption of the foodstuffs concerned .
The results show that mean weekly dietary intake of lead is 701 micrograms/person and 121.4 micrograms cadmium/person .
With respect to the provisional tolerable weekly intake ( PTWI ) , these values are equal to 19.9% for lead and 24.4% for cadmium .
