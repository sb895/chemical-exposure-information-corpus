Sera of 87 industrial workers with a history of occupational exposition to various diisocyanates , toluene diisocyanate , hexamethylene diisocyanate and methylene-diphenyl diisocyanate were analyzed for antibodies to isocyanate-conjugated human serum albumin and for anti-dsDNA autoantibodies .
Ten workers ( approx. 11% ) were shown to have elevated anti-dsDNA autoantibody concentrations and 13 revealed antibodies to isocyanate-modified human serum albumin .
The overlap of both tests being positive was calculated at about 40% .
It would seem , therefore , that routine estimation of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies could provide additional useful information for the clinical diagnosis of occupational health impairment due to isocyanate exposure .
