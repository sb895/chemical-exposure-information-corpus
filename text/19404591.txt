In the research , the contents of heavy metals , Al , Cd and Pb , in the hair of individuals who reside in similar environmental conditions were spectrometrically determined with the use of atomic emission spectrometry\u2013inductively coupled plasma spectrophotometer .
The relation to their tobacco smoking habit , age and sex was established .
It was observed that the level of all three determined elements was generally higher in the hair of smokers in comparison to hair of non-smokers in both younger and older age groups .
In addition , it has been observed that , in the group of elderly people over 50 years old , there was an increase in the content of aluminium , cadmium and lead both in smokers and non-smokers , irrespective of their sex .
The sex-related differences in the content of the investigated elements were not unidirectional , and only in few cases did they reveal statistical significance .
