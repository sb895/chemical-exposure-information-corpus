Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were commercially produced between 1959 and 1984 in eastern Slovakia .
Improper handling led to a highly contaminated local environment and high levels of PCBs in humans and wildlife in the Michalovce area .
The aim of this study was to analyse serum for methylsulfonyl metabolites of PCB ( MeSO(2)-PCBs ) and DDE ( 3-MeSO(2)-DDE ) in serum samples from pregnant women and in a selected number of paired cord blood samples to assess maternal sulfone levels and patterns , and transplacental transfer of these metabolites .
The donating women were from two districts in eastern Slovakia .
A liquid-liquid extraction method together with separation of substance groups and further clean-up on silica gel columns were applied prior to analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 3-MeSO(2)-DDE was the major methyl sulfone in most of the samples followed by a yet not identified MeSO(2)-hexaCB , 4'-MeSO(2)-CB101 , 4'-MeSO(2)-CB87 and 4-MeSO(2)-CB149 .
The women from the contaminated area had three times higher concentrations of the MeSO(2)-PCBs than women from the reference area .
This is the first report on methyl sulfone metabolites of PCB and DDE in human cord serum .
It is shown that these metabolites are transported through the placenta .
The levels of MeSO(2)-PCBs in the maternal serum were about 1.5 times higher than in the corresponding cord serum on a lipid weight basis .
For 3-MeSO(2)-DDE , the levels were about the same in maternal and cord serum .
The difference in the maternal:cord ratio , comparing MeSO(2)-PCBs with 3-MeSO(2)-DDE might be due to differences in transport through the placenta caused by their different affinities for lipoproteins and plasma proteins .
