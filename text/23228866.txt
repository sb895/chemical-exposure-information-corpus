This study investigated the occurrence of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and several additive brominated flame retardants ( BFRs ) in indoor dust and air from two Vietnamese informal e-waste recycling sites ( EWRSs ) and an urban site in order to assess the relevance of these media for human exposure .
The levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) , 1,2-bis-(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane ( BTBPE ) and decabromodiphenyl ethane ( DBDPE ) in settled house dust from the EWRSs ( 130-12,000 , 5.4-400 , 5.2-620 and 31-1400 ng g(-1) , respectively ) were significantly higher than in urban house dust but the levels of PCBs ( 4.8-320 ng g(-1) ) were not higher .
The levels of PCBs and PBDEs in air at e-waste recycling houses ( 1000-1800 and 620-720 pg m(-3) , respectively ) , determined using passive sampling , were also higher compared with non-e-waste houses .
The composition of BFRs in EWRS samples suggests the influence from high-temperature processes and occurrence of waste materials containing older BFR formulations .
Results of daily intake estimation for e-waste recycling workers are in good agreement with the accumulation patterns previously observed in human milk and indicate that dust ingestion contributes a large portion of the PBDE intake ( 60%-88% ) , and air inhalation to the low-chlorinated PCB intake ( >80% for triCBs ) due to their high levels in dust and air , respectively .
Further investigation of both indoor dust and air as the exposure media for other e-waste recycling-related contaminants and assessment of health risk associated with exposure to these contaminant mixtures is necessary .
