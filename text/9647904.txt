In this paper , we present results from the SAPALDIA study ( Swiss Study on Air Pollution and Lung Diseases in Adults ) regarding associations between lung function [ forced vital capacity ( FVC ) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1) ] , as assessed during the cross-sectional study in 1991 , and average levels of NO2 exposure within the eight study communities .
We distinguished average home outdoor exposure and average personal exposure to NO2 and obtained exposure estimates by computing regional averages of passive sampler measurements performed by a random subsample of SAPALDIA participants in 1993 .
Previous analyses had revealed associations between average lung function and average air pollution levels between communities .
The present results show that such associations may also be seen within communities : a 10-micrograms per m3 increase in average home outdoor and personal exposure to NO2 between zones of residence of the same community was associated with a change in average FVC by -0.59% [ 95% confidence limits ( CL ) = 0.01 , -1.19 ] and -0.74% ( 95% CL = -0.07 , -1.41 ) , respectively .
These values , however , are smaller than the ones found for the corresponding associations between study communities : -1.67% ( 95% CL = -1.01 , -2.33 ) and -2.93% ( 95% CL = -2.11 , -3.75 ) , respectively .
The different magnitudes of these two types of associations might be explained by differences in spatial variation between various components of air pollution .
