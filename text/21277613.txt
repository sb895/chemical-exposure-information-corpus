This study investigates the compositional variations , changes in concentrations and contribution of particular congeners of PCDDs , PCDFs , non-ortho PCBs and mono-ortho PCBs in human milk from two mothers sampled during the 12-month lactation period .
Total PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB concentration in milk sampled from the primiparous mother on day 5 after delivery was 37 pg TEQ/g fat , and this value decreased significantly by 43% at 12 months .
In milk sampled from the multiparous mother nursing her second child on day 5 after delivery was 12 pg TEQ/g fat , and this value decreased by 40% at 12 months .
The decrease was statistically significant not for PCDD/Fs , but for dioxin-like PCBs .
The ratio variance of the congener profiles of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in the milk remained similar during lactation .
Moreover , the congener profiles of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in the milk showed similar percentages for both mothers independent of the lactation event and the number of previous births .
The mean daily intake of dioxins by the infant nursed by the primiparous mother and the infant nursed by the multiparous mother up to six months of age was 140 and 46 pg TEQ/kg body weight , respectively .
From seven to twelve months of age , the mean daily intake was 37 and 13 pg TEQ/kg body weight , respectively .
Both values decreased by approximately 70% .
The reasons why the mothers ' body burden of dioxins decreased by breastfeeding and why the infants ' daily intake of human milk per body weight decreased as the infant grows older consequently decreased were considered .
