We conducted a congener-specific analysis of non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( non-dioxin-like PCBs ) in blood collected between July 2002 and July 2004 from 195 pregnant women living in Sapporo City of Hokkaido Prefecture , Japan .
The present study is one of the few studies in which full congener concentrations of non-dioxin-like PCBs have been measured in the blood of pregnant women .
Of the 195 pregnant women , 101 were primipara ( mean : 28.8 years , median : 28.0 years ) and 94 were multipara ( mean : 32.3 years , median : 33.0 years ) .
Among the 197 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners , 58 congeners were identified in the blood of pregnant women .
The arithmetic mean total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers in Sapporo City were 42.2-329.3 ( mean : 114.5 , median : 98.6 ) and 31.5-258.0 ( mean : 100.3 , median : 91.4)ngg(-1)lipid , respectively .
The results show that the contamination of non-dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of women has decreased compared to past levels in other domestic areas , in which the subject age was similar to that in this study .
The results of the present study indicate that current levels of non-dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of Japanese women and can be used as baseline data for future temporal trends .
The sums of the ratios of the concentrations of hexaCBs and heptaCBs to the total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers were 78.5% and 77.7% , respectively .
The hexaCBs ratios in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers were 45.4% and 44.7% , respectively .
HexaCB-153 among hexaCBs congeners , the most abundant congener in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers , contributed approximately 22.0% and 21.8% to the total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners that were measured in the blood , respectively .
Among the non-dioxin-like PCB congeners measured in the present study , hexaCB-138 , heptaCB-170 , heptaCB-180 , and heptaCB-182/heptaCB-187 also showed high ratios to total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners detected in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers .
With regard to the relationship between the total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in maternal blood and the number of deliveries or the age of primiparous and multifarious mothers , the total levels of these PCB congeners tended to decreases with increases in the number of deliveries and significantly increased with increasing maternal age in both groups .
Furthermore , significant correlations were observed between the total concentrations of these PCB congeners in blood and the age of primiparae and multiparae .
The concentrations of hexaCB-153 in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers showed a close correlation to the total concentrations of these PCBs , suggesting that hexaCB-153 could be an indicator of total concentrations of non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in the blood of pregnant women .
