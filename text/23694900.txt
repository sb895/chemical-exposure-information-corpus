BACKGROUND Inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) causes cancer and possibly other adverse health outcomes .
Arsenic-based drugs are permitted in poultry production ; however , the contribution of chicken consumption to iAs intake is unknown .
OBJECTIVES We sought to characterize the arsenic species profile in chicken meat and estimate bladder and lung cancer risk associated with consuming chicken produced with arsenic-based drugs .
METHODS Conventional , antibiotic-free , and organic chicken samples were collected from grocery stores in 10 U.S. metropolitan areas from December 2010 through June 2011 .
We tested 116 raw and 142 cooked chicken samples for total arsenic , and we determined arsenic species in 65 raw and 78 cooked samples that contained total arsenic at \u2265 10 µg/kg dry weight .
RESULTS The geometric mean ( GM ) of total arsenic in cooked chicken meat samples was 3.0 µg/kg ( 95% CI : 2.5 , 3.6 ) .
Among the 78 cooked samples that were speciated , iAs concentrations were higher in conventional samples ( GM = 1.8 µg/kg ; 95% CI : 1.4 , 2.3 ) than in antibiotic-free ( GM = 0.7 µg/kg ; 95% CI : 0.5 , 1.0 ) or organic ( GM = 0.6 µg/kg ; 95% CI : 0.5 , 0.8 ) samples .
Roxarsone was detected in 20 of 40 conventional samples , 1 of 13 antibiotic-free samples , and none of the 25 organic samples. iAs concentrations in roxarsone-positive samples ( GM = 2.3 µg/kg ; 95% CI : 1.7 , 3.1 ) were significantly higher than those in roxarsone-negative samples ( GM = 0.8 µg/kg ; 95% CI : 0.7 , 1.0 ) .
Cooking increased iAs and decreased roxarsone concentrations .
We estimated that consumers of conventional chicken would ingest an additional 0.11 µg/day iAs ( in an 82-g serving ) compared with consumers of organic chicken .
Assuming lifetime exposure and a proposed cancer slope factor of 25.7 per milligram per kilogram of body weight per day , this increase in arsenic exposure could result in 3.7 additional lifetime bladder and lung cancer cases per 100,000 exposed persons .
CONCLUSIONS Conventional chicken meat had higher iAs concentrations than did conventional antibiotic-free and organic chicken meat samples .
Cessation of arsenical drug use could reduce exposure and the burden of arsenic-related disease in chicken consumers .
