The over-riding aim of the present investigation was to obtain information concerning exposure that can be used as a basis for studies on the health of individuals residing in the Michalovce area of eastern Slovakia which is heavily contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .
Accordingly , this work focused on determination of serum concentrations of hydroxylated ( OH-PCBs ) and methylsulfonyl-substituted ( MeSO2-PCBs ) metabolites of PCBs .
One hundred and twenty-two men and women , 20-59 years of age , living in the contaminated area and 175 from the control Stropkov/Svidnik district were selected randomly from 2047 sampled individuals .
Following a specially designed cleanup , the levels of various congeners of OH-PCBs and MeSO2-PCBs in their serum were quantitated by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry , with comparison to authentic reference standards .
The median concentrations of PCB congeners and their OH-PCB and MeSO2-PCB metabolites were 2-3-fold higher in residents of Michalovce than in the control region .
The levels of certain OH-PCB metabolites were in the same high range as those of individual PCB congeners , whereas the MeSO2-PCB levels were significantly lower .
The PCB and their metabolites were present at slightly higher concentrations in men than in women , and the serum levels of PCBs and MeSO2-PCBs increased with increasing age .
Thus , the environmental contamination resulting from previous industrial production of PCBs has led to elevated concentrations of PCBs and their metabolites in the serum of individuals living in the Michalovce area .
