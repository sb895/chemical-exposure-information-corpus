BACKGROUND Ingestion of groundwater with high concentrations of inorganic arsenic has been linked to adverse health outcomes , including bladder cancer , however studies have not consistently observed any elevation in risk at lower concentrations .
Genetic variability in the metabolism and clearance of arsenic is an important consideration in any investigation of its potential health risks .
Therefore , we examined the association between genes thought to play a role in the metabolism of arsenic and bladder cancer .
METHODS Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in GSTO-1 , As3MT and MTHFR were genotyped using DNA from 219 bladder cancer cases and 273 controls participating in a case-control study in Southeastern Michigan and exposed to low to moderate ( <50 \u03bcg/L ) levels of arsenic in their drinking water .
A time-weighted measure of arsenic exposure was constructed using measures from household water samples combined with past residential history , geocoded and merged with archived arsenic data predicted from multiple resources .
RESULTS While no single SNP in As3MT was significantly associated with bladder cancer overall , several SNPs were associated with bladder cancer among those exposed to higher arsenic levels .
Individuals with one or more copies of the C allele in rs11191439 ( the Met287Thr polymorphism ) had an elevated risk of bladder cancer ( OR = 1.17 ; 95% CI = 1.04-1.32 per 1 \u03bcg/L increase in average exposure ) .
However , no association was observed between average arsenic exposure and bladder cancer among TT homozygotes in the same SNP .
Bladder cancer cases were also 60% less likely to be homozygotes for the A allele in rs1476413 in MTHFR compared to controls ( OR = 0.40 ; 95% CI = 0.18-0.88 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Variation in As3MT and MTHFR is associated with bladder cancer among those exposed to relatively low concentrations of inorganic arsenic .
Further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings .
