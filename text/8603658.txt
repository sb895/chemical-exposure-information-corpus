The first methylmercury poisoning by consumption of fish arose in Minamata , Japan , in 1953 .
Methylmercury dispersed from Minamata to the Shiranui Sea until 1968 .
Mercury concentration in the hair of residents on the coast of the Shiranui Sea was 10 to 20 times higher than that in nonpolluted people in Kumamoto Prefecture in 1960 .
People on the coast of the Shiranui Sea have consumed fish containing low-dose methylmercury without a ban over decades until 1968 .
We studied the effect of long-term consumption of methylmercury on those people 10 years later after the end of methylmercury dispersion .
Our epidemiological study clarified that people in a fishing village ( Ooura ) on the coast of the Shiranui Sea showed a significantly higher frequency of neurological signs characteristic of methylmercury poisoning ( hypoesthesia , ataxia , impairment of hearing , visual change , and dysarthria ) in comparison with people in a nonpolluted fishing village ( Ichiburi ) .
The neurological disorders were still detected 10 years later in Ooura after the end of methylmercury dispersion from Minamata ; hypoesthesia showed the highest frequency in Ooura .
These results suggest that people on the coast of the Shiranui Sea were afected by long-term dietary exposure to methylmercury .
