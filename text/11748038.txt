The Inuit population residing in Nunavik ( northern Qu√©bec , Canada ) relies on species from the marine food web for subsistence and is therefore exposed to high doses of environmental contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and methylmercury and to a lesser extent lead .
In view of the neurotoxic properties of these substances following developmental exposure , we initiated a study on infant development in this remote coastal population .
Here we report the magnitude of prenatal exposure to these contaminants and to selective nutrients in Inuit mothers and their newborns who were recruited on the Hudson Bay coast .
We conducted interviews during the women's pregnancies and at 1 and 11 months postpartum and collected biological samples for mercury , lead , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and chlorinated pesticides analyses as well as selenium and N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n3-PUFA ) .
Cord blood , maternal blood , and maternal hair mercury concentrations averaged 18.5 microg/L , 10.4 microg/L , and 3.7 microg/g , respectively , and are similar to those found in the Faroe Islands but lower than those documented in the Seychelles Islands and New Zealand cohorts .
Concentrations of PCB congener 153 averaged 86.9 , 105.3 , and 131.6 microg/kg ( lipids ) in cord plasma , maternal plasma , and maternal milk , respectively ; prenatal exposure to PCBs in the Nunavik cohort is similar to that reported in the Dutch but much lower than those in other Arctic cohorts .
Levels of n3-PUFA in plasma phospholipids and selenium in blood are relatively high .
The relatively low correlations observed between organochlorine and methylmercury concentrations may make it easier to identify the specific developmental deficits attributable to each toxicant .
Similarly , the weak correlations noted between environmental contaminants and nutrients will facilitate the documentation of possible protective effects afforded by either n3-PUFA or selenium against neurotoxic contaminants .
