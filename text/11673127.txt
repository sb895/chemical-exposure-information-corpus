The objectives of this study were to to identify maternal characteristics associated with traditional food consumption and to examine food items associated with polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and mercury body burden in pregnant Inuit women from Northern Qu√©bec .
We interviewed women from three communities at mid-pregnancy and at 1 and 11 months postpartum .
We measured PCBs , Hg , and selenium in maternal blood ; Hg was also measured in maternal hair .
The women reported eating significant amounts of fish , beluga muktuk/fat , seal meat , and seal fat .
Although consumption of fish and seal was associated with lower socioeconomic status , consumption of beluga whale was uniform across strata .
Fish and seal meat consumption was associated with increased Hg concentrations in hair .
Traditional food intake during pregnancy was unrelated to PCB body burden , which is more a function of lifetime consumption .
This study corroborated previous findings relating marine mammal and fish consumption to increased Hg and selenium body burden .
Despite widespread knowledge regarding the presence of these contaminants in traditional foods , a large proportion of Inuit women increased their consumption of these foods during pregnancy , primarily because of pregnancy-related changes in food preferences and the belief that these foods are beneficial during pregnancy .
