Fish is an important item in the diet of Amazonians , and per se is their best single source of essential nutrients .
Rapid urbanization and migration are bringing changes in dietary habits of Amazonians .
Exposure to fish-Hg during pregnancy and lactation were studied in 100 women and newborns from Porto Velho .
Tissue-Hg concentrations and neurodevelopment ( Gesell Developmental Schedules ) were assessed at birth and at 6 months in exclusively breastfed infants .
Maternal mean frequency of fish consumption was low ( <2 meals/week ; range 0->7 meals/week ) compared to Amazonian standards .
Women consuming <2 fish meals/week showed less median hair-Hg ( 3.5 microgg-1 ) than women that consumed 2 fish meals/week ( 5.7 microgg ) .
Median total Hg in maternal hair ( 5.4 microgg-1 ) was higher than in newborns ( 1.6 microgg-1 ) .
Significant correlation was observed between maternal hair-Hg and infant hair-Hg at birth ( r=0.353 ; p<0.01 ) and at six months ( r=0.510 ; p<0.01 ) .
Placenta-Hg was also significantly correlated to maternal hair-Hg ( r=0.321 ; p<0.01 ) , newborn hair-Hg ( r=0.219 ; p<0.05 ) , maternal blood-Hg ( r=0.250 ; p<0.01 ) and to umbilical cord-Hg ( r=0.857 ; p<0.01 ) .
Most infants ( 74% ) had normal Gesell Schedules but among the 26% showing neuro-motor development delays only six ( 7% ) had multiple ( motor , language , and adaptative ) delays .
The infants with multiple delays were born from mothers with range of hair-Hg comparable to mothers of normally developed infants .
Coincidentally , mothers of infants with multiple delays also showed the lowest range of income and level of education .
Fish consumption , income , and level of education varied greatly among these breastfeeding urban mothers .
It seems that development delays of exclusively breastfed infants are a component of the health inequalities that accompanies socioeconomic disadvantages .
