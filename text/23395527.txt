Polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs ) were measured in serum of twelve firefighters sampled after a fire event in San Francisco , California , along with polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , p,p'-DDE , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , perfluorinated chemicals ( PFCs ) , bisphenol-A ( BPA ) and tetrabromobisphenol-A ( TBBPA ) .
TEQPCDD/F concentrations were relatively low ( mean 5pgg(-1) ( lipid weight ) , lw , range 1-11pgg(-1)lw ) , but concentrations of 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD , a congener indicative of exposure during firefighting , were elevated .
Tentative WHO2005-TEQs calculated for PBDD/Fs in our samples ( mean 104pgg(-1)lw , range 0.2-734pgg(-1)lw ) suggested that PBDD/Fs may contribute substantially to dioxin-like toxicity in individual firefighters .
PBDE concentrations were elevated in firefighter serum ( mean 135ngg(-1)lw , range 48-442ngg(-1)lw ) .
PBDE-209 , PBDE-47 and PBDE-153 were prevalent congeners ; PBDE-209 contributed >50% of the total PBDE concentration in four individuals , implying continuous occupational exposure to deca-BDE .
Perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) was the dominant PFC in serum ( mean 12ngml(-1) ( wet weight ) , ww , range 3ngml(-1)ww to 59ngml(-1)ww ) , followed by perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) ( mean 7ngml(-1)ww , range 2ngml(-1)ww to 12ngml(-1)ww ) .
Concentrations of perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) ( mean 2ngml(-1)ww , range 1-4ngml(-1)ww ) were higher than those reported in the high-smoke exposure group of World Trade Center fire responders , suggesting that the California firefighters were exposed to PFNA in smoke during firefighting .
Given their elevated rates of cancers , these results illustrate the importance of monitoring halogenated contaminants including PBDD/Fs in firefighters .
