Arsenic contamination of rice irrigated with contaminated groundwater contributes to the additional arsenic burden of the population where rice is the staple food .
In an arsenic contaminated area , an experimental field-based study done on nine fields elucidated significant positive correlation between arsenic in irrigation water and soil , irrigation water and rice , and also soil and rice both for Boro ( groundwater ) and Aman ( rainwater ) rice .
Speciation studies showed that for both Boro ( cooked ) and Aman ( raw ) rice from contaminated area , 90% of total recovered arsenic was inorganic .
In arsenic contaminated , uncontaminated villages , and Kolkata city , daily quantities of arsenic ingested by adult population from cooked rice diet are equivalent to 6.5 , 1.8 , and 2.3 L respectively , of drinking water containing WHO guideline value .
In contaminated area , daily intake only from cooked Boro rice for 34.6% of the samples exceeded the WHO recommended MTDI value ( 2 microg In-As day(-1) kg(-1) body wt ) , whereas daily intake from Aman rice was below MTDI value as was rice from uncontaminated areas and Kolkata city .
Our study indicated that employing traditional rice cooking method as followed in Bengal delta and using water having arsenic <3 microg L(-1) for cooking , actual exposure to arsenic from rice would be much less .
