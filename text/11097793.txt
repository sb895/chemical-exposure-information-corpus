The region of Alta Floresta in the South of the Amazon basin , close to the Teles Pires River , was one of the main prospecting gold areas in the Amazon Basin until the beginning of the 1990s .
The economic growth was accompanied by a considerable increase in the population , due to a massive influx of migrants from the southern region of the country .
Women had an important role during that process .
They worked in the " garimpos " in different activities , such as cooking or managing , where they were exposed mainly to indoor elemental mercury during burning of amalgam .
They also worked in gold dealers ' shops , where a great amount of amalgam was burned daily .
Fish consumption was an important dietary protein source and also a possible exposure pathway , due to the high Hg concentrations reported in carnivorous species .
The present study evaluates the mercury uptake and consequent risks involved for pregnant women from Alta Floresta at the end of the gold rush period .
The survey included women at different pregnancy stages and it was supported by clinical exams , followed by an interview with a specific questionnaire .
Mercury hair concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 8.2 microg/g were found among women , with 13% of them showing concentrations above 2 microg/g .
According to the results , mean differences in hair mercury concentration were statistically higher for pregnant women if they had worked in gold mining areas , they had consumed alcohol , their husbands had worked as " garimpeiros, " they ate fish , and/or they had malaria before and/or during pregnancy
