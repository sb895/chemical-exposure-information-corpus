Inhalation exposure to total and hexavalent chromium ( TCr and HCr ) was assessed by personal air sampling and biological monitoring in 53 welders and 20 references .
Median inhalation exposure levels of TCr were 1.3 , 6.0 , and 5.4 microg/m(3) for welders of mild steel ( MS , <5% alloys ) , high alloy steel ( HAS , >5% alloys ) , and stainless steel ( SS , >26% alloys ) , respectively .
The median exposures to HCr compounds were 0.23 , 0.20 , and 0.08 microg/m(3) , respectively .
Median concentrations of TCr in urine , blood plasma and erythrocytes were elevated in all welders , compared with the corresponding median concentrations in the reference group ( p<0.005 ) .
The TCr levels observed in plasma were two-fold higher in welders of SS and HAS than in welders of MS ( p<0.01 ) .
Exposure to HCr as indicated by median total content of Cr in erythrocytes was 10 microg/L in welders of SS , MS and HAS .
Uptake of TCr during the shift was confirmed for welders of SS by a median increase of urinary TCr from pre- to post-shift of 0.30 microg/g creatinine .
For welders of MS and HAS as a group TCr was not increased .
