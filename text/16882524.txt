The mechanism(s) by which arsenic exposure contributes to human cancer risk is unknown ; however , several indirect cocarcinogenesis mechanisms have been proposed .
Many studies support the role of As in altering one or more DNA repair processes .
In the present study we used individual-level exposure data and biologic samples to investigate the effects of As exposure on nucleotide excision repair in two study populations , focusing on the excision repair cross-complement 1 ( ERCC1 ) component .
We measured drinking water , urinary , or toenail As levels and obtained cryopreserved lymphocytes of a subset of individuals enrolled in epidemiologic studies in New Hampshire ( USA ) and Sonora ( Mexico ) .
Additionally , in corroborative laboratory studies , we examined the effects of As on DNA repair in a cultured human cell model .
Arsenic exposure was associated with decreased expression of ERCC1 in isolated lymphocytes at the mRNA and protein levels .
In addition , lymphocytes from As-exposed individuals showed higher levels of DNA damage , as measured by a comet assay , both at baseline and after a 2-acetoxyacetylaminofluorene ( 2-AAAF ) challenge .
In support of the in vivo data , As exposure decreased ERCC1 mRNA expression and enhanced levels of DNA damage after a 2-AAAF challenge in cell culture .
These data provide further evidence to support the ability of As to inhibit the DNA repair machinery , which is likely to enhance the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of other directly genotoxic compounds , as part of a cocarcinogenic mechanism of action .
