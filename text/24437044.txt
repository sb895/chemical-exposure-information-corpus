The First National Environmental Health Survey of Child Care Centers was conducted to provide information about lead , allergen , and pesticide levels in licensed U.S. child care centers .
Lead levels were measured in settled dust , paint , and play area soil ; indoor allergen levels were measured in settled dust ; and pesticide residues were measured on indoor surfaces and in play area soil .
Fourteen percent of centers had significant lead hazards , suggesting that an estimated 470,000 children under age six ( approximately 10% of all children in licensed centers ) attend centers with significant lead hazards .
Approximately 5% of centers had levels of allergens associated with asthma and allergic conditions .
Three-quarters of centers had pesticides applied ( either indoors or outdoors ) during the previous year .
Although most centers did not appear to present risks from lead and allergens , some centers did have unsafe levels of these contaminants .
These conclusions cannot be generalized to unlicensed child care arrangements .
