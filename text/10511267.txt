Personal air samplers were attached to workers wearing protective masks to determine the levels of toluene vapor in the breathing zone .
Concentrations of toluene in exhaled air , blood and urine ; and hippuric acid and o-cresol concentrations in the urine of the workers were determined .
Subsequently , toluene concentrations in the air inhaled by workers with and without gas masks were estimated by single and multiple regression equations .
Analysis of single regression equations revealed that , compared with toluene concentrations in air , masks decreased the concentrations of the four biological exposure indicators : toluene in exhaled air , urinary toluene , urinary hippuric acid and urinary o-cresol by about 29% in average .
Analysis by multiple regression equations showed a decrease of 38% in four biological indicators .
Since average exposure to toluene in the shop was relatively low , the workers wore the masks only during high concentrations of toluene ; they were , however , exposed to direct inhalation when the masks were removed in lower concentrations .
