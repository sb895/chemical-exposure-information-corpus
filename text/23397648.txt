The study described in this article aimed to determine if measurable levels of mercury , lead , and cadmium are detected in the umbilical cord blood specimens collected in a community hospital in Rhode Island and if prenatal exposure correlates with prematurity or fetal growth indicators .
Total mercury , lead , and cadmium concentrations were measured in 538 specimens of cord blood and correlated with demographic characteristics and pregnancy outcomes for each mother-infant pair .
Lead concentrations determined in the cord blood of Rhode Island women ( geometric mean 0.99 microg/dL ) were similar to those reported in U.S. biomonitoring studies .
The overall geometric mean for mercury concentration ( 0.52 microg/L ) was slightly lower than in other comparable studies .
Cadmium concentrations were generally below the limit of detection .
A statistically significant correlation was detected between elevated mercury concentrations and racial and ethnic characteristics of the study participants .
Non-Hispanic African-American mothers were 9.6 times more likely to have a mercury concentration > or = 5.8 microg/L compared to women of other racial/ethnic backgrounds .
No association was detected between elevated mercury levels and adverse birth outcomes .
