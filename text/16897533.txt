Cyanide is a very toxic chemical that is used to extract gold from its ores .
Wastewaters from gold mining companies such as Bogoso Gold Limited ( BGL ) contain cyanide and other potentially toxic chemicals that have adverse effects on human beings and aquatic organisms .
This study was conducted to evaluate the human health risk assessment from exposure to free cyanide via oral and dermal contact of surface/underground water by resident adults within the concession of Bogoso Gold Limited .
The chronic non-cancer health risk from exposure to cyanide in River Bogo Upstream is 230 and 43 ( by Central Tendency Exposure ( CTE ) parameters respectively ) .
This means that approximately 230 and 43 resident adults are likely to suffer diseases related to cyanide intoxication via oral and dermal contact respectively .
For chronic exposure to River Bogo Downstream by resident adults , the non-cancer health risks are : 0.031 and 0.57 via oral and dermal contact for CTE parameters respectively , which also means that , the non-cancer health risks associated with cyanide intoxication is negligible as the hazard index is less than 1.0 via oral and dermal contacts respectively .
The results showed that health risk for acute exposure to cyanide by the resident adults is very high .
Hence the residents attribute most of the unexplained deaths in the communities to accidental ingestion and dermal contact of cyanide water .
