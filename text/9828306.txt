Effects of postnatal exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) on lymphocyte subpopulations were investigated in the peripheral blood of 36 breast-fed Japanese babies .
As a result , estimated total intakes of these chemicals in toxic equivalent quantity ( TEQ ) converted into 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( 2,3,7,8-TCDD ) equivalents from the breast milk positively and negatively correlated with the respective percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the blood of breast-fed babies .
Consequently , the ratios of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells showed significant increasing tendency with the estimated total TEQ intakes .
Therefore , our study suggests that exposure to background levels of the highly toxic organochlorine compounds through the breast milk influences the human neonatal immune system .
