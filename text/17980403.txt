The use of iridium in the latest catalytic converters to further reduce nitrogen oxide emission in the exhaust of lean-burn engines could result in increased atmospheric levels of this element in high-density vehicle traffic areas .
The objective of this study is to assess environmental Ir pollution and its urinary levels in workers and an urban control group .
Environmental monitoring inside a tram consisted in air samplings of total suspended particles ( TSP ) , PM10 and PM2.5 carried out during November 2005 .
Urinary Ir levels were evaluated in 64 municipal tram drivers and in 58 administrative employees as controls .
Quantification of Ir in air samples and urine was performed by means of Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry .
Means+/-standard deviation of Ir levels in TSP , in PM10 and PM2.5 fractions were 1.43+/-1.66 , 0.44+/-0.27 and 0.36+/-0.19 pg m(-3) , respectively .
No statistically significant differences were observed among urinary Ir values in the exposed subjects and control group .
The Ir levels in Rome air are still sufficiently low , even if the increased use of new Ir-based catalysts could be of some concern in the near future .
The results of our study are of interest as they are a first attempt to explore airborne levels and urinary concentrations of Ir in an urban context at medium-high density of vehicle traffic .
Particular attention should be given to the fact that Ir was found in the finest dust particles as the effects of fine particles containing Ir have not yet been studied .
