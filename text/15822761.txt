AIM To study mercury levels in hair from mothers and newborns in Surinam .
METHODS Hair and urine was collected from thirty-nine mothers of different ethnicity and hair from their newborns .
The women delivered in a large hospital in the capital .
Mercury analysis was performed .
RESULTS Fourteen ( 36% ) of the mothers had elevated Hg concentrations in the hair as compared with a reference US population .
Thirty-one newborns ( 80% ) presented with a higher mercury level in hair than their mothers .
A positive correlation existed between the hair levels of the mothers and their newborns .
Urine Hg concentrations were not elevated .
