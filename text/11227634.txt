Mercury exposure and health status were examined in 40 gold workers in the area surrounding El Callao , Venezuela .
Concentrations of mercury in workplace air were measured on 3 successive days , and spot urine and hair samples were also taken for analysis .
Subjects underwent a physical examination and completed a questionnaire regarding employment history , work activities involving mercury exposure , use of protective clothing and equipment , and frequency of 37 symptoms associated with mercury toxicity .
A complete set of health data was collected for 29 of the subjects .
Use of protective equipment was limited , and 17.9% , 24.1% , and 48.3% of subjects had mercury concentrations in air , hair , and urine , respectively , above contemporary occupational exposure guidelines .
Physical examination found the workers to be generally healthy and without overt symptoms of mercury toxicity .
The frequency of psychoneurological , gastrointestinal , cardio-respiratory , and dermal symptoms was unrelated to any of the measures of mercury exposure .
Two subjects had modestly elevated urinary levels of N-acetyl beta-D-glucosaminidase .
Despite substantial occupational exposure to mercury among a number of the subjects , few adverse health effects were observed that were plausibly related to mercury .
