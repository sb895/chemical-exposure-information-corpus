In the present study , the results of a measurement campaign aiming to assess cancer risk among two special groups of population : policemen and laboratory technicians exposed to the toxic substances , benzene and formaldehyde are presented .
The exposure is compared to general population risk .
The results show that policemen working outdoor ( traffic regulation , patrol on foot or in vehicles , etc. ) are exposed at a significantly higher benzene concentration ( 3-5 times ) than the general population , while the exposure to carbonyls is in general lower .
The laboratory technicians appear to be highly exposed to formaldehyde while no significant variation of benzene exposure in comparison to the general population is recorded .
The assessment revealed that laboratory technicians and policemen run a 20% and 1% higher cancer risk respectively compared to the general population .
Indoor working place air quality is more significant in assessing cancer risk in these two categories of professionals , due to the higher Inhalation Unit Risk ( IUR ) of formaldehyde compared to benzene .
Since the origin of the danger to laboratory technicians is clear ( use of chemicals necessary for the experiments ) , in policemen the presence of carbonyls in indoor air concentrations due to smoking or used materials constitute a danger equal to the exposure to traffic originated air pollutants .
