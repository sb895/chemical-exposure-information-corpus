A chemical plant located in Brescia , an industrial city in North-Western Italy , produced polychlorobiphenyls ( PCBs ) during a 30-50 year period , causing widespread pollution of the surrounding agricultural area .
This area contains several small farms , which principally produce veal meat for private consumption of the farmers ' families .
The pollution went undiscovered for many years , during which period contaminated food was regularly consumed .
This paper reports the polychlorodibenzodioxin ( PCDD ) , polychlorodibenzofuran ( PCDF ) and PCB levels of a serum sample pooled from the consumers of contaminated food , compared to six population groups of the city of Brescia .
Four of these groups were selected in order to represent , respectively , the local general population and the residents of three zones of the polluted area , while the last two groups represented , respectively , the present and the former workers of the plant .
One human milk sample from one of the consumers of contaminated food was also analyzed .
Results show that the consumers of the contaminated food and the former workers of the plant display considerably higher levels than all other groups .
The levels of general population and of all other groups were generally similar both to each other and to the range of literature values for unexposed populations .
The respective contribution of PCDDs , PCDFs , mono-ortho and non-ortho PCBs ( dioxin-like PCBs ) to ( Toxicity Equivalents ) TEQ of the population groups of this study were also compared to literature data : the two groups with a high contamination level , together with the human milk sample , displayed a higher incidence of mono-ortho PCBs and a lower contribution of PCDD , possibly correlated with the source of contamination .
