Research has shown that workers employed in footwear manufacture are at increased risk of some cancers , the strongest evidence being for nasal cancer and leukemia .
Footwear-workers are routinely exposed to complex mixtures of solvents in degreasers , cleaners , primers , and adhesives used in the production process as toluene , n-hexane , acetone , and possibly dust particles , additives in shoe materials and degradation products of materials .
The recognition of the potential health-hazards of solvent-based adhesives ( SBAs ) has lead to the development of adhesives with no organic solvents , the water-based adhesives ( WBA ) .
We investigated footwear-workers ( all males ) exposed to SBA ( n=29 ) ( for 3.98+/-4.13 years ) , and WBA ( n=16 ) , which had spent the six months previous to the study employed in an experimental section which used only water-based adhesives , although they had previously worked in sections which used solvent-based adhesives ( for 5.80+/-4.03 years ) ; 25 healthy subjects were used as controls .
The Comet assay and the micronucleus test were used as endpoints , while the traditional parameters for assessing exposure to toluene in organic mixtures by measuring the concentration of urinary hippuric acid were also assessed .
Our results showed a significantly lower mean concentration of hippuric acid in the control group than found in the SBA ( P<0.001 ) and WBA ( P<0.05 ) groups .
The Comet assay results showed that there was a significant increase in the mean damage index for the SBA ( P<0.001 ) group in comparison to the WBA group and control ( P<0.05 ) .
For the micronucleus test in binucleated lymphocytes and exfoliated buccal cell , the three groups were not statistically different .
Our study demonstrated that water-based adhesives are clearly a better option for safeguarding the health of footwear-workers , even with possibility of isocyanate presence , while the positive results observed in SBA group might be explained by chloroprene presence in the adhesive .
