The internal burden of arsenic among 5- to 14-year-old eastern German children in the heavily polluted areas of Hettstedt , a region of smelting and copper mining , and Bitterfeld , a center of chemical production and coal mining , was compared with that in a control area ( Zerbst ) by means of urinary arsenic concentrations in 1992-94 .
The unadjusted geometric mean among the 950 children was significantly higher in Hettstedt ( 5.1 micrograms/l ; 95% C.I. 4.8-5.5 ) but not in Bitterfeld ( 4.3 micrograms/l ; 95% C.I. 3.7-4.9 ) compared with the control area ( 4.0 micrograms/l ; 95% C.I. 3.5-4.5 ) .
This difference persisted after adjustment for relevant confounders .
Despite these regional differences , recent fish consumption was as strongly associated with urinary arsenic levels ( 42% increase , 95% C.I. 18-71% ) .
Additionally , although the geometric mean among the children in Hettstedt ( 4.8 micrograms As/g creatinine ; 95% C.I. 4.5-5.1 ) was higher than that found in an environmental survey of eastern German children ( 3.60 micrograms As/g creatinine ; 95% C.I. 3.06-4.24 ) , it was similar to that found among western German children ( 4.59 micrograms As/g creatinine ; 95% C.I. 4.20-5.02 ) .
This suggests that the arsenic contamination in Hettstedt is not substantially increasing the internal burden of arsenic among children above that found in other German children .
