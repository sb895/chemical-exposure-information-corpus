Workers who work near volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) source(s) , motor vehicle exhausts and/or gasoline vapor emissions , are suspected to be exposed to highly-elevated VOC levels during their work-time .
This study confirmed this suspicion and evaluated the work-time exposure VOCs for traffic police officers , parking garage attendants , service station attendants , roadside storekeepers and underground storekeepers , by measuring the concentrations of six aromatic VOCs in workplace air , or personal air and breath samples .
For nearly all target VOCs , the post-work breath concentrations of the workers were slightly or significantly higher than the pre-work breath concentrations , depending on the compound and occupation .
Furthermore , both the pre- and post-work breath concentrations of the workers showed elevated levels compared with a control group of college students .
The post-work breath concentrations were significantly correlated with the personal air concentrations , while the pre-work breath concentrations were not .
Smoking workers were not always exposed to higher aromatic VOC levels than non-smoking workers .
The breath and personal air concentrations for all the target compounds were both higher for underground parking garage attendants than for ground-level parking attendants .
For all the target compounds except toluene , storekeepers exhibited similar levels of exposure for all store types .
Print shopkeepers recorded the highest toluene exposure .
