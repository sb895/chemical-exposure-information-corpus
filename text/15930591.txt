The objective of this study was to establish the potential relationship between the levels of various metals in hair and cognitive functions in children living in zones of Tarragona ( Catalonia , Spain ) with different metal pollution levels .
Thirty-nine boys and 61 girls ( 12-14 yr old ) from various schools were selected for the study .
The concentrations of cadmium ( Cd ) , chromium ( Cr ) , mercury ( Hg ) , lead ( Pb ) , manganese ( Mn ) , nickel ( Ni ) , and tin ( Sn ) in scalp hair were determined by inductively coupled plasma- mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) .
Attention , visuospatial capabilities , and abstract reasoning were assessed as indicators of cognitive impairment .
Three categories of attention were defined : low , medium , and high .
A significant negative correlation ( p=0.019 ) between Pb levels in hair and attention was observed .
Significant differences between Pb levels in hair in low- and medium-performance groups and those in the high-performance group were also found .
Moreover , a positive correlation ( p=0.048 ) between Hg hair concentrations and visuospatial capabilities was also noted .
