Benzene is a recognized hematotoxin and leukemogen , but its mechanisms of action in humans are still uncertain .
To provide insight into these processes , we carried out a cross-sectional study of 44 healthy workers currently exposed to benzene ( median 8-hr time-weighted average ; 31 ppm ) , and unexposed controls in Shanghai , China .
Here we provide an overview of the study results on peripheral blood cells levels and somatic cell mutation frequency measured by the glycophorin A ( GPA ) gene loss assay and report on peripheral cytokine levels .
All peripheral blood cells levels ( i.e. , total white blood cells , absolute lymphocyte count , platelets , red blood cells , and hemoglobin ) were decreased among exposed workers compared to controls , with the exception of the red blood cell mean corpuscular volume , which was higher among exposed subjects .
In contrast , peripheral cytokine levels ( interleukin-3 , interleukin-6 , erythropoietin , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor , tissue necrosis factor-alpha ) in a subset of the most highly exposed workers ( n = 11 ) were similar to values in controls ( n = 11 ) , suggesting that benzene does not affect these growth factor levels in peripheral blood .
The GPA assay measures stem cell or precursor erythroid cell mutations expressed in peripheral red blood cells of MN heterozygous subjects , identifying NN variants , which result from loss of the GPA M allele and duplication of the N allele , and N phi variants , which arise from gene inactivation .
The NN ( but not N phi ) GPA variant cell frequency was elevated in the exposed workers compared with controls ( mean +/- SD , 13.9 +/- 8.4 mutants per million cells versus 7.4 +/- 5.2 per million cells , ( respectively ; p = 0.0002 ) , suggesting that benzene produces gene-duplicating but not gene-inactivating mutations at the GPA locus in bone marrow cells of exposed humans .
These findings , combined with ongoing analyses of benzene macromolecular adducts and chromosomal aberrations , will provide an opportunity to comprehensively evaluate a wide range of early biologic effects associated with benzene exposure in humans .
