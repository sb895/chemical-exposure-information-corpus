An acute oral protein load causes a transient hyperfiltration that might reveal a loss of glomerular permselectivity properties .
The effect of an oral protein load on the urinary excretion rate of albumin ( UAE ) , beta-2-microglobulin ( UB2MGE ) , and retinol-binding protein ( URBPE ) was thus examined in cadmium- and lead-exposed workers .
The results show a transient increase in UB2MGE and URBPE without relevant changes in UAE .
These changes were also observed in control groups and are due to competitive inhibition of tubular protein reabsorption by absorbed cationic amino acids .
These results do not support the hypothesis that the acute protein load test is of great utility in revealing a silent glomerular filtration disturbance in lead- or cadmium-exposed workers .
However , it might disclose imminent renal tubular dysfunction in cadmium workers not yet showing increased microproteinuria under baseline conditions .
