There is a paucity of prospective cohort studies investigating the impact of environmental factors on the development of cardiometabolic ( CM ) disorders like type II diabetes ( T2DM ) .
The objective of the Air-Pollution and Cardiometabolic Diseases ( AIRCMD ) study is to investigate the impact of personal level air pollution measures [ personal black carbon ( BC)/sulfate measures ] and ambient fine particulate matter [ (PM2.5)/NO2 ] levels on propensity to type II diabetes in Beijing , China .
Subjects with metabolic syndrome will undergo four repeated study visits within each season over a one year period following an initial screening visit .
At each study visit , subjects will be monitored for sub-acute exposure to personal and ambient measures of air-pollution exposure and will undergo a series of functional CM outcomes .
The primary endpoints include independent associations between integrated 5-day mean exposure to PM2.5 and BC and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) measures , 24-hour mean diastolic and mean arterial pressure and endothelial-dependent vasodilatation .
The secondary endpoints will explore the mechanistic explanation for a causal relationship between exposures and propensity for type II diabetes and will include additional functional outcomes such as arterial compliance , heart rate variability and plasma adipokines .
The novel aspects of the study include the launch of infrastructure for future translational investigations in highly polluted urbanized environments and the creation of novel methodologies for linking personalized exposure measurements with functional CM outcomes .
We believe that AIRCMD will allow for unprecedented new investigations into the association between environmental risk factors and CM disorders .
