We assessed levels and determinants of mercury biomarkers among residents of Montreal and surroundings who eat sportfish from the nearby St. Lawrence River .
Participants were selected from 1118 adult fishers responding to a 1996 screening questionnaire ; the study sample ( n=132 ) overrepresented respondents expected to have the greatest and the least exposure to mercury .
Tissue mercury concentrations were associated with sportfish consumption : among participants who ate sportfish at least once weekly , hair geometric mean ( GM)=0.82+/-2.54 microg/g and blood mercury GM=3.03+/-2.43 microg/L , compared to hair GM=0.38+/-2.28 microg/g and blood mercury GM=1.44+/-2.23 microg/L for those who ate sportfish less than once weekly .
While these levels are somewhat higher than those shown for other Greater Lakes and St. Lawrence River fishers , only one participant surpassed the Canadian recommended population mercury limit of 6 microg/g for hair and 20 microg/L for blood .
Consumption of several sportfish species independently explained much of the variation in measured blood mercury ; the predatory species pike was the most important in multivariable regression .
Coincident consumption of waterfowl , fishing during the longer summer/fall rather than the brief winter season , and fishers ' age were independently associated with blood mercury .
Serum selenium related neither to the level of fish consumption nor to the participants ' blood mercury .
