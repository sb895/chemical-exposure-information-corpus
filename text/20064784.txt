BACKGROUND We recently reported that the main reason for the documented higher prevalence of arsenic-related skin lesions among men than among women is the result of less efficient arsenic metabolism .
OBJECTIVE Because smoking has been associated with less efficient arsenic methylation , we aimed to elucidate interactions between tobacco use and arsenic metabolism for the risk of developing skin lesions .
METHODS We used a population-based case-referent study that showed increased risk for skin lesions in relation to chronic arsenic exposure via drinking water in Bangladesh and randomly selected 526 of the referents ( random sample of inhabitants > 4 years old ; 47% male ) and all 504 cases ( 54% male ) with arsenic-related skin lesions to measure arsenic metabolites [ methylarsonic acid ( MA ) and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA) ] in urine using high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICPMS ) .
RESULTS The odds ratio for skin lesions was almost three times higher in the highest tertile of urinary %MA than in the lowest tertile .
Men who smoked cigarettes and bidis ( locally produced cigarettes ; 33% of referents , 58% of cases ) had a significantly higher risk for skin lesions than did nonsmoking men ; this association decreased slightly after accounting for arsenic metabolism .
Only two women smoked , but women who chewed tobacco ( 21% of referents , 43% of cases ) had a considerably higher risk of skin lesions than did women who did not use tobacco .
The odds ratio ( OR ) for women who chewed tobacco and who had < or = 7.9%MA was 3.8 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.4-10 ] compared with women in the same MA tertile who did not use tobacco .
In the highest tertile of %MA or %inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) , women who chewed tobacco had ORs of 7.3 and 7.5 , respectively , compared with women in the lowest tertiles who did not use tobacco .
CONCLUSION The increased risk of arsenic-related skin lesions in male smokers compared with nonsmokers appears to be partly explained by impaired arsenic methylation , while there seemed to be an excess risk due to interaction between chewing tobacco and arsenic metabolism in women .
