OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relationship between arsenic exposure and oral cavity lesions among an arsenic-exposed population in Bangladesh .
METHODS We carried out an analysis utilizing the baseline data of the Health Effects of Arsenic Exposure Longitudinal Study , which is an ongoing population-based cohort study to investigate health outcomes associated with arsenic exposure via drinking water in Araihazar , Bangladesh .
We used multinomial regression models to estimate the risk of oral cavity lesions .
RESULTS Participants with high urinary arsenic levels ( 286.1 to 5000.0 \u03bcg/g ) were more likely to develop arsenical lesions of the gums ( multinomial odds ratio = 2.90 ; 95% confidence interval , 1.11 to 7.54 ) , and tongue ( multinomial odds ratio = 2.79 ; 95% confidence interval , 1.51 to 5.15 ) , compared with those with urinary arsenic levels of 7.0 to 134.0 \u03bcg/g .
CONCLUSIONS Higher level of arsenic exposure was positively associated with increased arsenical lesions of the gums and tongue .
