Mortality and morbidity of vascular diseases , including stroke , are known to be associated with chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic through drinking water .
A tap-water supply system was implemented in the early 1960s in the blackfoot disease ( BFD ) endemic areas of Taiwan .
The objective of this study was to examine whether mortality attributed to stroke decreased among residents living in the BFD-endemic areas after the curtailment of arsenic exposure .
Further it was of interest to determine whether arsenic exposure was related to a specific type of stroke .
Standardized mortality ratios ( SMRs ) for stroke were calculated for the BFD endemic area for the years 1971-2000 .
The study results show that mortality due to primary intracerebral hemorrhage ( PIH ) declined gradually after the improvement of drinking-water supply system by elimination of arsenic exposure through removal of artesian well water .
Based on the reversibility and specificity criteria , the association between arsenic exposure and mortality due to PIH is likely to be causal .
