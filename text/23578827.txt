BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Manganese , lead , arsenic and mercury are common neurotoxic metals in the environment .
Nonetheless , the relationship between prenatal exposure to low doses of neurotoxic metals and neurodevelopment in children is not clear .
The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between in utero exposure to environmental neurotoxic metals and neurodevelopment at 2 years of age .
METHODS The population of this study came from the Taiwan Birth Panel Study .
We included 230 pairs of non-smoking mothers without any occupational exposure and their singleton full-term children .
The information about exposure during pregnancy was obtained using a structured questionnaire , and the manganese , lead , arsenic and mercury levels in umbilical cord blood samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .
We used the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers ( CDIIT ) to evaluate the developmental status of each child at 2 years of age , and we examined the association of in utero exposure to environmental metals and neurodevelopment using linear regression models .
RESULTS The median concentrations of manganese , lead , arsenic and mercury in the cord blood samples in this study were 47.90 µg/L ( range , 17.88-106.85 µg/L ) , 11.41 µg/L ( range 0.16-43.22 µg/L ) , 4.05 µg/L ( range , 1.50-12.88 µg/L ) and 12.17 µg/L ( range , 1.53-64.87 µg/L ) , respectively .
After adjusting for maternal age , infant gender , environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy and after delivery , Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory results , and arsenic and mercury levels in cord blood , we found that manganese and lead levels above the 75th percentile had a significant adverse association with the overall ( \u03b2=-7.03 , SE=2.65 , P=0.0085 ) , cognitive ( \u03b2=-8.19 , SE=3.17 , P=0.0105 ) , and language quotients ( \u03b2=-6.81 , SE=2.73 , P=0.0133 ) of the CDIIT .
CONCLUSIONS In utero exposure to environmental manganese and lead may have an adverse association with neurodevelopment at 2 years of age , and there is an interaction effect between the manganese and lead levels in the cord blood that could aggravate the effect .
