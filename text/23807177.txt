Exhaled nitric oxide ( eNO ) is increasingly used as a non-invasive measure of airway inflammation .
Despite this , little information exists regarding the potential effects of indoor microbial components on eNO .
We determined the influence of microbial contaminants in house dust and other indoor environmental characteristics on eNO levels in seven-year-olds with and without a physician-diagnosis of asthma .
The study included 158 children recruited from a birth cohort study , and 32 were physician-diagnosed as asthmatic .
The relationship between eNO levels and exposures to home dust streptomycetes , endotoxin , and molds was investigated .
Streptomycetes and endotoxin were analyzed both as loads and concentrations in separate models .
Dog , cat , and dust mite allergens also were evaluated .
In the multivariate exposure models , high streptomycetes loads and concentrations were significantly associated with a decrease in eNO levels in asthmatic ( p<0.001 ) but not in healthy children .
The presence of dog allergen , however , was associated with increased levels of eNO ( p=0.001 ) .
Dust endotoxin was not significant .
The relationship between eNO and indoor exposure to common outdoor molds was u-shaped .
In non-asthmatic children , none of the exposure variables was significantly associated with eNO levels .
To our knowledge , this is the first study demonstrating a significant association between microbial components in the indoor environment and eNO levels in asthmatic children .
This study demonstrates the importance of simultaneously assessing multiple home exposures of asthmatic children to better understand opposing effects .
Common components of the indoor Streptomyces community may beneficially influence airway inflammation .
