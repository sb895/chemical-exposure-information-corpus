We studied four libraries in the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia ( Northern Italy ) to determine the presence of polluting agents such as total dusts , formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) including benzene , toluene and xylenes and to assess the sense of well-being perceived by library users .
This investigation was suggested by an increase in reported symptoms related to Sick Building Syndrome ( SBS ) observed in recent decades among people spending most of their time in various indoor environments , including libraries .
The microclimatic conditions and the concentrations of pollutants indicated an acceptable situation on the whole , even though a wide range of total dust values ( 40-350 microg/m3 ) and total VOCs ( 203-749 microg/m3 ) was observed .
However , the perception of the different environmental parameters by the 130 library users that were interviewed identified the existence of some discomfort mainly caused by the feeling of poor ventilation .
Moreover , 78.5% of the subjects stated they had at least one of the 16 investigated symptoms potentially related to a SBS .
The place of occurrence of the self-reported symptoms was also investigated , the symptoms arising during library attendance more frequently than elsewhere were only four , and in particular feeling hot , sore eyes , dry throat and breathing difficulties .
Overall , our study has shown the existence of an association between microclimatic perceptions as reported by library users and subjective symptoms related to SBS , considering the four libraries separately , the highest prevalence of self-reported symptoms was found in the library where environmental discomfort as perceived by users was greatest .
Nevertheless , an association between subjective self-reported symptoms and both microclimatic conditions as resulted by instrumental measurements and/or pollutants concentrations was not apparent .
