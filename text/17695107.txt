In order to test the value of an integrated approach for the analysis of health risks at contaminated sites , an integrated health risk assessment in a mining area was performed following 3 steps : 1 ) Environmental monitoring of surface soil , 2 ) assessment of exposure to metals in children and native rodents , and 3 ) DNA damage evaluation ( comet assay ) in children and rodents .
These aspects also were studied in less exposed populations .
Our results in humans showed that children living in the most polluted area ( Villa de la Paz , Mexico ) had higher lead blood concentrations ( geometric mean of 13.8 microg/dL ) and urinary arsenic levels ( geometric mean of 52.1 microg/g creatinine ) compared to children living in a control area ( Matehuala , Mexico ; blood lead of 7.3 microg/dL ; urinary arsenic of 16.8 microg/g creatinine ) .
Furthermore , the exposed children also had increased DNA damage ( tail moment mean in Villa de la Paz of 4.8 vs 3.9 in Matehuala ; p < 0.05 ) .
Results in rodents were identical .
Animals captured in the polluted area had higher levels of arsenic ( geometric mean of 1.3 microg/g in liver and 1.8 microg/g in kidney ) , lead ( 0.2 microg/g in liver and 0.9 microg/g in kidney ) , and cadmium ( 0.8 microg/g in liver and 2.2 microg/g in kidney ) , and increased DNA damage ( tail moment mean of 18.2 ) when compared to control animals ( arsenic in liver of 0.08 microg/g and kidney of 0.1 microg/g ; lead in liver of 0.06 microg/g and kidney of 0.3 microg/g ; cadmium in liver of 0.06 microg/g and kidney of 0.6 microg/g ; and tail moment of 14.2 ) .
With the data in children and rodents , the weight-of-evidence for health risks ( in this case DNA damage ) associated with metal exposure in Villa de la Paz was strengthened .
Therefore , a remediation program was easier to justify , and a feasibility study at this site is under way .
