Background : The presence of perfluoroalkyl acids ( PFAAs ) in breast milk has been documented , but their lactational transfer has been rarely studied .
Determination of the elimination rates of these chemicals during breastfeeding is important and critical for assessing exposure in mothers and infants.Objectives : We aimed to investigate the association between breastfeeding and maternal serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) , perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) , and perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS ) .
For a subset of the population , for whom we also have their infants ' measurements , we investigated associations of breastfeeding with infant serum PFAA concentrations.Methods : The present analysis included 633 women from the C8 Science Panel Study who had a child < 3.5 years of age and who provided blood samples and reported detailed information on breastfeeding at the time of survey .
PFAA serum concentrations were available for all mothers and 8% ( n = 49 ) of the infants .
Maternal and infant serum concentrations were regressed on duration of breastfeeding.Results : Each month of breastfeeding was associated with lower maternal serum concentrations of PFOA ( -3% ; 95% CI : -5 , -2% ) , PFOS ( -3% ; 95% CI : -3 , -2% ) , PFNA ( -2% ; 95% CI : -2 , -1% ) , and PFHxS ( -1% ; 95% CI : -2 , 0% ) .
The infant PFOA and PFOS serum concentrations were 6% ( 95% CI : 1 , 10% ) and 4% ( 95% CI : 1 , 7% ) higher per month of breastfeeding.Conclusions : Breast milk is the optimal food for infants , but is also a PFAA excretion route for lactating mothers and exposure route for nursing infants.Citation : Mondal D , Weldon RH , Armstrong BG , Gibson LJ , Lopez-Espinosa MJ , Shin HM , Fletcher T. 2014 .
