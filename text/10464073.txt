To determine the relationship of arsenic-associated skin lesions and degree of arsenic exposure , a cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangladesh , where a large part of the population is exposed through drinking water .
Four villages in Bangladesh were identified as mainly dependent on wells contaminated with arsenic .
We interviewed and examined 1,481 subjects [ Greater/equal to ] 30 years of age in these villages .
A total of 430 subjects had skin lesions ( keratosis , hyperpigmentation , or hypopigmentation ) .
Individual exposure assessment could only be estimated by present levels and in terms of a dose index , i.e. , arsenic levels divided by individual body weight .
Arsenic water concentrations ranged from 10 to 2,040 microg/L , and the crude overall prevalence rate for skin lesions was 29/100 .
After age adjustment to the world population the prevalence rate was 30. 1/100 and 26.5/100 for males and females , respectively .
There was a significant trend for the prevalence rate both in relation to exposure levels and to dose index ( p < 0.05 ) , regardless of sex .
This study shows a higher prevalence rate of arsenic skin lesions in males than females , with clear dose-response relationship .
The overall high prevalence rate in the studied villages is an alarming sign of arsenic exposure and requires an urgent remedy .
