Our study reports on the total mercury ( HgT ) concentrations measured in the muscles and livers of several benthic , demersal and pelagic fish species caught inside and outside of Augusta Bay ( southern Italy ) , a semi-enclosed marine area , highly contaminated by the uncontrolled ( since the 1950s to 1978s ) discharge of the largest European petrochemical plant .
Mercury levels in fish tissues are discussed with regard to specific habitat , size and/or age of the specimens and HgT distribution in the bottom sediments .
Results suggest a still active Hg release mechanism from the polluted sediments to the marine environment .
Also , the high HgT concentrations measured in fishes caught in the external area of the bay imply a potential role of Augusta Bay as a pollutant source for the Mediterranean ecosystem .
Finally , values of hazard target quotient ( THQ ) and estimated weekly intake ( EWI ) demonstrate that consumption of fishes caught inside the bay represents a serious risk for human health .
Also , data indicate that intake of fishes caught from the external area of the bay , especially for that concern demersal and benthic species , could be represent a significant component of risk for the local population .
