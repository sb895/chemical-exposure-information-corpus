Skin exposure to permanent hair dye compounds was assessed in 33 hairdressers using a previously evaluated hand rinse method .
Hand rinse samples were collected from each hand before the start of hair dyeing , after application of the dye and after cutting the newly-dyed hair .
Sixteen of the hairdressers did not use gloves during dye application , and none used gloves while cutting the dyed hair .
The samples were analysed for pertinent aromatic amines and resorcinol ( RES ) using an HPLC method. 10 of 54 hair dye mixtures contained 1,4-phenylenediamine ( PPD ) , 40 toluene-2,5-diaminesulphate ( TDS ) , and 44 RES .
After application of the hair dye , PPD was found in samples from 4 hairdressers , TDS in 12 and RES in 21 .
PPD was found in samples from 3 of the 17 hairdressers that used gloves during application of the hair dye , TDS in 5 and RES in 11 .
In the group that did not use gloves during the application of hair dye ( n = 16 ) PPD was found in samples from 1 hairdresser , TDS in 7 and RES in 11 .
After cutting the dyed hair , PPD was found in samples from 5 hairdressers , TDS in 14 and RES in 20 .
Analysis of samples of newly-dyed hair cuttings revealed the presence of aromatic amines and/or RES in 11/12 samples .
Our conclusion is that hairdressers ' skin is exposed to allergenic compounds during hair dyeing .
Exposure occurs from dye application , from cutting newly-dyed hair and from background exposure .
The exposure loadings are in the level , where there is a risk of sensitization and/or elicitation of contact allergy ( i.e. for PPD 22-939 nmol per hand ) .
The glove use observed in this study was often improper , and was insufficient to prevent exposure .
To reduce exposure , improved skin protection and work routines are important .
