A total of 191 fishermen and their family ( 32-82 years ) living in some mercury-polluted areas along the Shiranui Sea volunteered for the present study .
They made a living by fishery and had formerly eaten the methyl mercury-contaminated fish and shellfish caught there .
The questionnaire on subjective symptoms , fish eating habits , and past living history was conducted on the subjects .
In addition , they were clinically examined in detail by several neurologists and scalp hair was collected .
With six exceptions , all the 185 subjects showed a normal total mercury level in hair ( <10 ppm ) .
The ratio of methyl mercury to total mercury was 79-94% on the average for each group examined , suggesting indirect contamination ( perhaps through the food chain ) .
Despite their low mercury level in scalp hair , however , the subjects showed various neurological symptoms , particularly , sensory disturbance ( such as the glove and stocking type ) , at a very high rate .
Thus , it seems fair to state that , in addition to officially recognized Minamata disease patients , there still exist many people with atypical , slight Minamata disease on the coast of the Shiranui Sea .
The current hair mercury level is not necessarily useful as a criterion for diagnosing chronic Minamata disease because of the long lapse of time .
