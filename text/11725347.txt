Oncogenes are involved with the regulation of cellular proliferation and thus could be important in the development of many cancers .
Cells transformed in culture by ras genes can be activated either by the introduction of specific point mutations or by overexpression of the normal proto-oncogene .
The ras genes encode a protein of 189 amino acids ( molecular mass 21 kDa ) designated as p21. ras p21 proteins are contained in all eukaryotic cells on the inner surface of the plasma membrane .
We measured ras p21 proteins in lung cancer patients , patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and workers exposed to emissions from petrochemical plants and 1,3-butadiene and 1,3-butadiene/styrene .
Proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by Western blotting and detected by chemiluminescence .
A monoclonal pan-ras antibody was used as the primary antibody .
Optical densities of the peak area of the protein bands were calculated and values which were two standard deviations above negative control means were considered positive .
Many of the cancer patients and some of the COPD patients gave positive responses , whilst exposed worker groups did not show statistically significant increases by comparison with the controls .
Thus , an increase in ras oncoproteins could be a biomarker for cancer or the disease state in general , but it cannot be ruled out that it is a biomarker for exposure since many of the individuals examined were smokers exposed to cigarette smoke .
