Children may be exposed to arsenic during contact with structures treated with chromated copper arsenate ( CCA ) .
A high frequency of hand-to-mouth activity may increase their risk of ingesting arsenic .
Previous work showed that arsenic concentrations in the hand-wash samples of children playing on CCA playgrounds were four times higher than those playing on non-CCA playgrounds .
It is not clear whether playing on CCA playgrounds results in elevated overall exposure to arsenic .
The objective of this study was to perform arsenic biomonitoring in children to determine whether playing on CCA-treated playgrounds substantially contributes to their overall exposure to arsenic .
One hundred and twenty five saliva samples from 61 children and 101 urine samples from 45 children were collected after children played on 8 CCA and 8 non-CCA playgrounds .
Arsenic speciation analysis was conducted using high performance liquid chromatography combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .
The arsenic species detected in the urine and saliva samples from children playing on CCA and non-CCA playgrounds were similar .
Dimethylarsinic acid and arsenobetaine were the main arsenic species found in urine samples .
The sum of inorganic trivalent and pentavalent arsenic , monomethylarsonic acid , and dimethylarsinic acid in urine was 15 +/- 28 microg/L in the CCA group and 12 +/- 23 microg/L in the non-CCA group ( p = 0.60 ) .
The sum of these species in saliva was 1.1 +/- 2.1 microg/L in the CCA group and 1.4 +/- 1.1 microg/L in the non-CCA group ( p = 0.32 ) .
These results show that there is no significant difference in the concentration or speciation of arsenic between the samples from children playing on CCA and non-CCA playgrounds .
Contact with CCA playgrounds is not likely to significantly contribute to the overall arsenic exposure in children ; other sources such as dietary arsenic may be a main contributor to their overall exposure .
