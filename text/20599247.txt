Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) have been determined in 21 samples of selected food and beverages such as meat , fish , bread , vegetables , milk , drinking water and tea from the Norwegian marked .
Up to 12 different PFCs were detected in the samples .
Perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid ( PFOS ) were found in concentrations similar to or lower than what has been observed in other studies world-wide .
Differences in the relative proportion of PFOA and PFOS between samples of animal origin and samples of non-animal origin were observed and support findings that PFOS has a higher bioaccumulation potential in animals than PFOA .
Based on these 21 measurements and consumption data for the general Norwegian population , a rough estimate of the total dietary intake of PFCs was found to be around 100 ng d(-1) .
PFOA and PFOS contributed to about 50% of the total intake .
When dividing the population in gender and age groups , estimated intakes were decreasing with increasing age and were higher in males than females .
The estimated intakes of PFOS and PFOA in the present study are lower than what has been reported in studies from Spain , Germany , United Kingdom , Canada and Japan .
This study illustrates that by improving the analytical methods for determination of PFC in food samples , a broad range of compounds can be detected , which is important when assessing dietary exposure .
