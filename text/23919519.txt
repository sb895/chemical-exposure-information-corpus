Dechlorane Plus ( DP ) , as a widely used flame retardant in different electrical and textile applications , has recently attracted great concern around the world .
The present study investigated the DP levels and distribution in human samples from a DP manufacturing plant and a nearby area in east China .
The DP concentrations ranged from 89.8 to 2958 ng/g lipid weight in whole blood and 4.08 to 2159 ng/g dry weight in hair .
For the workers engaged in DP manufacturing process , their DP levels were significantly higher than those in most of the other two control groups from the nearby area .
The values of anti-DP fractional abundance ( fanti ratio ) were commonly lower in the human samples from both the manufacturing plant and nearby area compared with those in the commercial products , and excretion as well as biotransformation are possible reasons for stereoselective accumulation of the syn-DP isomer in humans .
Furthermore , a significantly positive relationship ( p < 0.05 ) was obtained between ( i ) the concentrations ( and fanti ) in the paired blood and hair samples , indicating a similar distribution pattern of the two DP isomers in the paired samples ; ( ii ) the DP levels in human body and the exposure time ( p < 0.05 ) , which suggests that further assessment could be needed to investigate potential long-term risks to the occupational population .
