To explore the levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in California , samples from 11 archived harbor seals ( Phoca vitulina Richardsi ) from the San Francisco Bay and breast adipose tissue samples from 23 women were analyzed .
The levels of PBDEs in human tissue samples were in the low ng/g fat range , with PBDEs 47 , 153 , 154 , 99 , and 100 as the major congeners .
Average sigma PBDEs ( 86 ng/g fat ) in these California women are the highest human levels reported to date .
An inverse relationship between concentration of PBDEs and age of these women was apparent .
The levels of PBDEs measured in harbor seal blubber were in the low ng/g to low microg/g fat range , with the same major congeners as those measured in the human tissues .
PBDE 47 was the highest among all congeners measured in both human tissue and seal blubber samples .
The concentrations of PBDEs in harbor seals in the San Francisco Bay have increased dramatically over the past decade , with current levels among the highest reported for this species .
