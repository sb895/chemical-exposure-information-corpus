Environmental toxicants such as metals may be detrimental to foetus and infant development and health because of their physiological immaturity , opportunistic and differential exposures , and a longer lifetime over which disease , initiated during pregnancy and in early life , can develop .
The placental mechanisms responsible for regulation of absorption and excretion of elements during pregnancy are not fully understood .
The aim of this paper is to assess the correlation for selected toxic and essential elements in paired whole blood samples of delivering women and cord blood , as well as to evaluate the placental permeability for selected elements .
Regression analyses used to assess this correlation in 62-paired samples of maternal and cord whole blood of delivering women show that the concentrations of mercury , lead , cobalt , arsenic and selenium in maternal and cord blood differed statistically .
Lead , cobalt , arsenic and selenium appear to pass the placental barrier by a diffusion mechanism .
It was also found that the mercury levels in cord blood were almost double those of the mother , suggesting that the foetus may act as a filter for the maternal mercury levels during pregnancy .
Transplacental transfer for arsenic and cobalt was 80% and 45% , respectively , suggesting that the placenta modulates the rate of transfer for these elements .
Cadmium , manganese , copper and zinc levels did not show statistically significant correlations between two compartments ( maternal versus cord whole blood ) .
The study confirms that most of the toxic metals measured have an ability to cross the placental barrier .
