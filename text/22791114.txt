Metal contamination of urban soils and homegrown products has caused major concern .
In Part 1 , we investigated the long-term effects of a former smelter on the degree of kitchen garden-soil contamination and the quality of the homegrown vegetables from these gardens .
The results showed that the soils retained a high level of contamination and that a large proportion of the vegetables produced did not comply with the legislation on the levels of metals allowed for human consumption .
The present study aims to assess the associated potential health risk to local inhabitants through consumption of homegrown vegetables and ingestion of soil particles using a land use-based approach .
For lead ( Pb ) , the standard hazard quotient ( HQ)-based risk assessment method was used to determine the HQ .
For cadmium ( Cd ) , the approach consisted of calculating the HQs and then deriving site-specific assessment criteria ( SSAC ) using the SNIFFER method .
The results suggested that the exposure pathways considered should not engender any form of deleterious health effects for adults .
For children , Pb was the main concern and induced a relatively high health risk through soil particle ingestion , and most total soil Cd concentrations exceeded the derived SSAC , in particular , through consumption of vegetables .
The metal bioaccessibility in soils was incorporated into the methods to establish more realistic risk assessment measures .
This study proposes an approach to integrate different human health risk assessment methods .
Further investigations should complete the assessment to improve risk determination , e.g. , the determination of metal bioaccessibility in vegetables .
