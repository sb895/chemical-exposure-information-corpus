Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) are one of the most common types of brominated flame retardants applied to foams , plastics and textiles to prevent fires .
These flame retardants are now regulated and are either banned or being voluntarily phased .
However , as these chemicals are persistent humans continue to be exposed .
Dust has been identified as an important source of exposure and hence residential concentrations are of interest .
The aim of this paper was to determine the concentrations of PBDEs in samples of residential dust from the homes of pregnant women in Western Australia .
Thirty residential dust samples were analysed for concentrations of 32 PBDE congeners .
Samples were collected from urban and rural areas .
PBDEs were detected in all residential dust samples with the sum of the most common PBDEs ( \u03a3(7) of BDEs 47 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 154 , 183 and 209 ) ranging from 60.4 to 82400 ng g(-1) ( median 571 ng g(-1) ) .
DecaBDE makes up the highest proportion of PBDEs in residential dust , on average 66% of \u03a3(32)PBDEs .
We did not find a relationship between housing characteristics nor the presence of appliances and PBDE concentrations .
Dust from urban areas had significantly higher concentrations of BDE-209 and \u03a3(32)PBDEs than dust from rural areas of Western Australia ( p values 0.01 and 0.03 respectively ) .
PBDEs were present in residential dust in Western Australia at concentrations higher than reported previously in Australia .
Further investigation of sources with a larger sample size is required to determine associations between PBDE concentrations and potential exposure sources and geographical regions .
