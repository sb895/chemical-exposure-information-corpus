Exposure to genotoxic compounds present in ambient air has been studied in Cotonou , Benin , a city where two-stroke motorbikes are the major form of transportation and gasoline quality is poor .
Personal monitoring and biomarkers were used to assess the exposure .
Non-smoking taxi-moto drivers ( city ) and village residents were the study subjects .
Benzene exposure was significantly higher in the city , as compared to the village ( 76.0+/-26.8 microg/m(3) versus 3.4+/-3.0 , p=0.0004 ) .
Urinary excretion of benzene and S-phenylmercapturic acid ( S-PMA ) were also highest in subjects living in the city , whereas 1-hydroxypyrene was not different .
The level of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , associated with particles , ranged from 76.21 to 103.23 in Cotonou versus 1.55 ng/m(3) for the village .
Determination of DNA damage in lymphocytes showed that subjects from the city had elevated number of lesions compared to subjects in the village in terms of bulky DNA adducts , 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 5-methylcytosine , whereas DNA fragmentations analysed by alkaline gel electrophoresis was not different between the subjects .
In conclusion , this study shows that air pollution is pronounced in Cotonou , BÃ©nin and is associated with elevated levels of DNA damage in residents of the city compared to people living in a non-polluted rural village .
