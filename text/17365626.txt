This study examined the difference between sulfhydryl-reactive metals ( mercury , lead , arsenic , and cadmium ) in the hair of 45 children with autism ( 1-6 yr of age ) as compared to 45 gender- , age- , and race-matched typical children .
Hair samples were measured with inductively coupled mass spectrometry .
Some studies , such as Holmes et al .
( 2003 ) , suggested that children with autism may be poor detoxifiers relative to normally developing children .
Metals that are not eliminated sequester in the brain .
Our study found that arsenic , cadmium , and lead were significantly lower in the hair of children with autism than in matched controls .
Mercury was in the same direction ( lower in autism ) following the same pattern , but did not achieve statistical significance .
The evidence from our study supports the notion that children with autism may have trouble excreting these metals , resulting in a higher body burden that may contribute to symptoms of autism .
