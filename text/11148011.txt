BACKGROUND Inorganic mercury is toxic to the nervous system , kidneys , and reproductive system .
We studied the health effects of mercury exposure among former employees of a chloralkali plant that operated from 1955 to 1994 in Georgia .
METHODS Former plant workers and unexposed workers from nearby employers were studied .
Exposure was assessed with a job-exposure matrix based on historical measurements and personnel records .
Health outcomes were assessed with interviews , physical examinations , neurological and neurobehavioral testing , renal function testing , and urinary porphyrin measurements .
Exposure-disease associations were assessed with multivariate modeling .
RESULTS Exposed workers reported more symptoms , and tended toward more physical examination abnormalities , than unexposed workers .
Exposed workers performed worse than unexposed subjects on some quantitative tests of vibration sense , motor speed and coordination , and tremor , and on one test of cognitive function .
Few findings remained significant when exposure was modeled as a continuous variable .
Neither renal function nor porphyrin excretion was associated with mercury exposure .
CONCLUSIONS Mercury-exposed chloralkali plant workers reported more symptoms than unexposed controls , but no strong associations were demonstrated with neurological or renal function or with porphyrin excretion .
