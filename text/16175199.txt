In order to build tools to quantify exposure to pesticides of farmers included into epidemiological studies , we performed a field study in Bordeaux vineyards during the 2001 and 2002 treatment seasons to identify parameters related to external contamination of workers .
In total , 37 treatment days were observed in tractor operators corresponding to 65 mixing operations , 71 spraying operations and 26 equipment cleaning .
In all , four operators with backpack sprayers and seven re-entry workers were also monitored .
We performed both detailed observations of treatment characteristics on the whole day and pesticide measurements of external contamination ( dermal and inhalation ) for each operation .
The median dermal contamination was 40.5 mg of active ingredient per day for tractor operators , 68.8 mg for backpack sprayers and 1.3 mg for vineyard workers .
Most of the contamination was observed on the hands ( 49% and 56.2% for mixing and spraying , respectively ) .
The median contribution of respiratory route in the total contamination was 1.1% .
A cleaning operation resulted in a 4.20 mg dermal contamination intermediate between a mixing ( 2.85 mg ) and a spraying operation ( 6.13 mg ) .
Farm owners experienced higher levels than workers and lower contaminations were observed in larger farms .
The contamination increased with the number of spraying phases and when equipment cleaning was performed .
Types of equipment influenced significantly the daily contamination , whereas personal protective equipment only resulted in a limited decrease of contamination .
