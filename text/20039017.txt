Ron Phibun District , approximately 800 km south of Bangkok , is the site of tin mines operated almost 100 years ago .
As a result of mining activities , arsenic contaminated the soil and groundwater of the district .
The specific aim of this study was to estimate the dietary intakes of total and inorganic arsenic in 20 adults ( 10 males and 10 females ) residing in Ron Phibun District by a duplicate food approach for 7-consecutive days .
The weekly intake rates of inorganic arsenic ranged from 5.54 to 13.3 microg/kg BW for males and 6.11-12.1 microg/kg BW for females .
