In 137 females ( F ) and 94 males ( M ) aged 21-35 years from organochlorines ( OCs ) polluted area ( POLL ) increased thyroid volume ( ThV ) , prevalence of antibodies to thyroperoxidase ( TPOab ) , thyrotropin receptor ( TRab ) and of impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) was found compared to 116 F and 107 M from background pollution area ( BCGR ) .
In F and M from POLL also strikingly increased level of PCBs , DDE and HCB was found .
Such findings were compared to the generation of their parents aged 41-55 years consisting of 320F/213M from POLL and 406F/231M from BCGR .
However , in spite of strikingly lower level of those OCs in young adults from POLL , they showed about the same prevalence of adverse health signs as the old generation .
From such reason 44 young F and 40 young M with lowest PCBs level from POLL were selected to obtain nearly the same PCB level as found in all young F and M from BCGR .
In such PCB adjusted groups the prevalence of TPOab , TRab , IFG and increased ThV was still significantly higher than that in all young subjects from BCGR .
At the same time , also the level of DDE and HCB in such PCBs adjusted groups was considerably lower .
It was concluded that such adverse effects in young adults from POLL possibly did not result from their actual OCs levels , but very likely from their exposure to high OCs levels of their mothers during their prenatal and perinatal life .
Thus , the data may be compatible with present views on transgenerational transmission of endocrine disruptors action .
