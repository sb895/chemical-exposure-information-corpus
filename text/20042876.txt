OBJECTIVE To know the variability of the creatinine-adjusted inorganic mercury ( HgUCr ) levels in women aged >or=12 years to evaluate the impact of residing at a site contaminated by mercury in soil .
METHODS A cross-sectional epidemiologic study was conducted , in which 122 women participated , in whom , HgUCr was determined .
Simultaneously , a questionnaire was applied for evaluate the different factors of mercury exposure , sociodemographic characteristics , and dietary hygiene measures .
The environmental exposures were evaluated by measure Hg in soil and mining dumps .
RESULTS Women aged >30 years residing in areas contaminated by Hg in soil ( >625 ppb ) had 212% more HgUCr than the women who living in areas least contaminated , while women with amalgam dental fillings had 120% more HgUCr than women without these .
CONCLUSION In conclusion , exposure to different physicochemical forms of Hg by environmental mechanisms and factors intrinsic to the women are probably responsible for HgUCr-level variability in the women .
