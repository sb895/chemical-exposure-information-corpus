Cadmium and lead have been identified as very toxic metals , which are widely present in the environment due to natural and anthropogenic emissions .
Many studies have shown that the food chain is the main pathway of cadmium and lead transfer from the environment to humans .
It is well documented that many factors will affect their transfer through food chains .
Previous investigations on heavy metals were mostly concentrated on one contaminant in isolation .
However , in real environments , exposure to mixtures of metals is ubiquitous such that cadmium pollution is invariably being associated with lead and zinc , etc .
This study focuses on the contamination and health effects of the metal mixtures .
For this purpose , a dietary survey was taken for 3 groups in Nanning in October 2002 .
Samples of soils , plants ( vegetables ) , urine and blood of humans were measured for Cd , Fe , Cu , Zn , Ca and Pb , in addition , the urinary indicators of renal dysfunction Albumin ( ALB ) , N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) , Beta-2-microglobulin ( beta2-MG ) and Retinol-binding protein ( RBP ) in urine were also measured .
Results showed that soil contamination with metal mixtures had caused significant renal dysfunction of the local residents living in the contaminated area , and the dose-response curve was somewhat altered by the mixed contamination of Cd and Pb as well as the intake of other minerals .
The importance of mixtures of metal contamination and human health are also discussed in this paper .
