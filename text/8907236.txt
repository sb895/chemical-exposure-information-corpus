A Japanese was estimated to ingest 3 and 11 pg/kg/day of TEQ from PCDD/PCDFs and coplanar PCBs respectively through foods .
A Japanese baby was calculated to consume 100-530 pg/kg/day level of TEQ through breast milk feeding , more than 60% being attributed to TEQ of coplanar PCBs .
These intakes of TEQ were compared to the average ( 154 ng/kg/day ) and minimum ( 28 ng/kg/day ) intakes of Yusho , a PCB posioning occurred in Japan in 1968 .
There are three or four orders of magnitude difference between the daily TEQ intakes of general population and Yusho patients .
However , the TEQ intakes by breast milk-fed babies of general population are at least 53 times less than the minimum intake of Yusho patients .
