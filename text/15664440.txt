Experiments were designed to evaluate and compare metallothionein ( MT ) , zinc and cadmium levels in human placentas of smoking and non-smoking women .
Smoking was assessed by self-reported cigarette consumption and urine cotinine levels before delivery .
Smoking pregnant women with urine cotinine levels higher than 130 ng/ml were included in the smoking group .
Determination of placental MT was performed by western blot analysis after tissue homogenization and saturation with cadmium chloride ( 1000 ppm ) .
Metallothionein was analyzed with a monoclonal antibody raised against MT-1 and MT-2 and with a second anti mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase .
Zinc and cadmium were determined by neutron activation analysis and atomic absorption spectrometry respectively .
Smokers showed higher placental MT and cadmium levels , together with decreased newborn birth weights , as compared to non-smokers .
The semi-quantitative analysis of western blots by band densitometry indicated that darker bands corresponded to MT present in smokers ' samples .
This study confirms that cigarette smoking increases cadmium accumulation in placental tissue and suggests that this element has a stimulatory effect on placental MT production .
