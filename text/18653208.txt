Human breast milk samples from primipara women from Northern ( Tromsø ) ( N=10 ) and Southern Norway ( Oslo ) ( N=19 ) collected in 2000-2001 were analysed with respect to hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCHs ) , chlordanes ( CHLs ) , DDTs , mirex , toxaphenes ( CHBs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polybrominated diphenylethers ( PBDEs ) and hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) .
CHBs , PBDEs and HBCD were only analysed in the Tromsø samples .
Sum-PCBs and sum-DDTs were the major organochlorines ( OCs ) ( 170 and 110 ng g(-1) lipid weight ( lw ) , respectively ) .
Other OCs were found in levels of approximately 10- to 300-fold lower than sum-PCBs .
Overall , the concentrations of OCs followed the decreasing order of PCBs>DDTs>HCB>HCHs approximately CHLs>CHBs>mirex .
Concentrations of sum-HCHs were significantly higher in breast milk from Oslo compared to Tromsø ( p<0.05 ) .
The PCB profile was dominated by PCB-153 , -138 and -180 .
The PBDE pattern was dominated by PBDE-47 and PBDE-153 .
The median level of sum-PBDEs was 4.1 ng g(-1) lw .
PBDE-209 was detected in all analysed samples ( median 0.13 ng g(-1) lw ) .
The estimated daily intake ( EDI ) for the median ( range ) of sum mono-ortho ( mo ) PCBs(8) was 3.7 ( 1-9 ) pg TEQ kg(-1) body weight per day for breast fed infants in Norway .
This exceeded the TDI by a factor of 1.8 ( 1-4 ) based only on intake of mono-ortho PCBs .
The present study shows that concentrations of OCs in primipara breast milk have decreased 50-60% since 1991 , and that this trend is continuing .
