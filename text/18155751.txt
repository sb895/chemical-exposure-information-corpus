BACKGROUND Mercury ( Hg ) is a ubiquitous pollutant that negatively affects fetal and child neurodevelopment at accidental high-dose exposure .
Some studies indicate that Mediterranean populations could be at risk of prenatal exposure to mercury through fish consumption .
OBJECTIVES To assess the prenatal exposure to total mercury ( T-Hg ) , both inorganic and organic , in newborns by analyzing the T-Hg concentration in cord blood , and to evaluate the role of maternal fish consumption in this exposure .
METHODS In the context of a multi-center project ( INMA project ) , a prospective birth cohort was set up in Valencia , Spain , from 2005 to 2006 .
A total of 253 newborns were included in this study .
We compared cord blood T-Hg concentration by levels of fish intake assessed by a food frequency questionnaire completed at 28-32 weeks of gestation .
Maternal covariates were obtained through a questionnaire .
RESULTS The geometric mean of T-Hg at birth was 9.9 microg/L ( 95% CI : 9.0 , 10.8 ) .
Seventy five percent of cord blood samples were above the estimated level assumed to be without appreciable harm ( 5.8 microg/L ) .
Women who consumed a portion of large oily fish , lean fish , or mixed fried fish two or more times per week had mean cord blood levels 1.6 , 1.4 and 1.3 times higher , respectively , than those who rarely or never consumed fish .
Other factors such as the mother's age , country of origin , smoking and season of delivery were also significantly and independently associated with cord blood T-Hg concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS Newborns from a Mediterranean area presented elevated levels of T-Hg in cord blood .
Higher concentrations of T-Hg were related to maternal fish intake , particularly in the case of large oily fish species .
