Parabens are used as anti-microbial preservatives in a range of consumer products , especially in cosmetics .
In vitro and animal studies have shown weak estrogenic and other endocrine disrupting effects of parabens , including reduced testosterone levels in exposed male rats .
The knowledge of paraben exposure , distribution and excretion in humans is limited .
In this study we determined the concentration of five parabens ; methyl- , ethyl- , n-propyl- , n-butyl- and benzylparaben in urine , serum and seminal plasma samples from 60 healthy Danish men .
To conduct the study a sensitive and specific method using LC-MS/MS for simultaneous determination of the five parabens was developed for all three different matrices .
Highest concentrations of the parabens were found in urine , wherein methyl- , ethyl- , n-propyl- and n-butyl parabens were measurable in 98% , 80% , 98% and 83% of the men , respectively .
Benzyl paraben was only measurable in urine from 7% of the men .
Methyl- and n-propyl parabens were also measurable in the majority of serum and seminal plasma samples , whereas the other parabens could only be detected in some of the samples .
In all the three matrices significant correlations between the parabens were seen .
Furthermore , urinary paraben concentrations correlate to the paraben concentrations in both serum and seminal plasma .
