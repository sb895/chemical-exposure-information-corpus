Majority of arsenicosis patients were male ( 56.67% ) .
The mean age of the cases was 43.07+/-13.73 years .
Nail changes were found in 26.67% of cases , most were nail dystrophy ( 23.33% ) and rest were Mee's line ( 3.34% ) .
There was significant difference between cases with or without nail changes and nail arsenic level .
