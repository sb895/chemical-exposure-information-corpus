The effects of organochlorines on human reproduction have been recently under scrutiny .
Some negative effects on animal reproduction have been reported .
In this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of maternal contamination with a certain group of organochlorines , which are cyclodienes , HCB ( hexachlorobenzene ) and beta-BHC ( beta-hexachlorocyclohexane ) on human reproduction .
Breast milk samples from 815 eligible Victorian mothers were used for measuring maternal contamination and the reproductive outcomes such as birth weight , head circumference and prematurity were taken from health files .
Our study did not show any significant negative effect on outcomes such as birth weight , small for gestation age , previous miscarriage or still birth , head circumference or sex ratio .
An inconsistent increase across oxychlordane exposure levels for prematurity was found .
We also found an inverse association between the highest levels of HCB and oxychlordane with previous miscarriage or still birth ; but this was based on small numbers and may be explained by loss of contaminants through the aborted fetus .
These results suggest that the declining contamination levels of these chemicals do not impose a threat to human reproduction .
