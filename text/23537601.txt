The aim of the present study was to examine the body burden of lead ( Pb ) , mercury ( Hg ) , and cadmium ( Cd ) in blood among Swedish adults and the association between blood levels , diet and other lifestyle factors .
The study was based on a subgroup ( n=273 ) of the national survey Riksmaten 2010-2011 ( 4-day food records and questionnaire ) .
Lead , Hg , and Cd were measured in whole blood , and Cd additionally in urine , by mass or fluorescence spectrometry methods .
The median values ( 5-95th percentiles ) of the metals in blood were as follows ; Pb : 13.4 ( 5.8-28.6 ) \u03bcg/L , Hg : 1.13 ( 0.31-3.45 ) \u03bcg/L , and Cd : 0.19 ( 0.09-1.08 ) \u03bcg/L .
All three metals increased with increasing age .
Lead levels in blood were positively associated with intakes of game and alcohol , Hg was related to fish intake , and blood Cd related to smoking and low iron stores and to a low meat intake .
Body burdens of the studied metals were generally below health based reference values , but several individuals had blood Pb levels above the reference point for possible nephrotoxic and developmental neurotoxic effects .
As health effects cannot be excluded , individuals with high Pb exposure should aim at decreasing their body burden , both from food and from other exposure routes .
