Although prenatal exposure to water disinfection by-products does not appear to affect the duration of gestation , its impact on fetal growth remains an open question .
The authors studied the associations between prenatal exposure to disinfection by-products and fetal growth restriction ( FGR ) and preterm birth in the PELAGIE cohort , a French birth cohort comprising 3,421 pregnant women recruited between 2002 and 2006 .
Exposure was assessed by estimating levels of trihalomethanes ( THMs ) in tap water during pregnancy and maternal water use and by measuring maternal urinary levels of trichloroacetic acid ( TCAA ) during early pregnancy in a nested case-control design that compared 174 FGR cases , 114 preterm births , and 399 controls .
Higher uptake of THMs ( especially brominated THMs ) was associated with a higher risk of FGR .
Women with TCAA detected in their urine ( >0.01 mg/L ) had a higher risk of FGR than those with TCAA levels below the detection limit ( adjusted odds ratio = 1.8 , 95% confidence interval : 0.9 , 3.7 ) and had an odds ratio for preterm birth below 1 ( adjusted odds ratio = 0.8 , 95% confidence interval : 0.3 , 2.6 ) .
Results from this prospective study , the first to use a biomarker of disinfection by-product exposure , suggest that prenatal exposure affects fetal growth , but the causal agent or agents remain to be identified .
