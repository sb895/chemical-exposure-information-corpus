Exposure to arsenic in drinking water is known to produce a variety of health problems , including peripheral neuropathy .
Auditory , visual and somatosensory impairment have been reported in Mongolian farmers living in the Yellow River Valley , where drinking water is contaminated by arsenic .
In the present study , sensory tests , including pinprick and vibration thresholds , were administered to 320 residents with well-water arsenic levels , ranging from non-detectable to 690 microg/L .
Vibration thresholds in the second and fifth fingers of both hands were measured using a vibrothesiometer .
Drinking water , urine and toenail samples were obtained to assess arsenic exposure and body burden .
Regression analyses indicated significant associations of pinprick scores and vibration thresholds with all arsenic measures .
Vibration thresholds were more strongly associated with urinary than water or nail arsenic measures , but odds ratios for decreased pinprick sensitivity were highest for the water arsenic measure .
Results of the current study indicate neurosensory effects of arsenic exposure at concentrations well below the 1000 microg/L drinking water level specified by NRC , and suggest that non-carcinogenic end-points , such as vibration thresholds , are useful in the risk assessment of exposure to arsenic in drinking water .
