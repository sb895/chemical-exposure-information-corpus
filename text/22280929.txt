Assessment of human exposure to environmental persistent organic pollutants such as organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans ( PCDD/Fs ) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) based on the levels in human breast milk provides a reasonable tool not only to assess the contaminant burden in mothers but also to assess potential exposure of breast-fed neonates .
There are limited data on levels of PCBs and OCPs in humans but no previous reports from Turkey on chemically determined levels PAHs in human milk .
The aim of this study was to report the levels and accumulation profiles of OCPs , PCBs and PAHs in 47 breast milk samples obtained from a Mediterranean city , Mersin .
High resolution analyses were performed by a gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer ( GC-MS ) .
Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane ( 4.4'-DDE ) was the dominant pollutant .
Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane ( ÃŸ-HCH ) , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( 4.4'-DDT ) , dieldrin , hexachlorobenzene , oxy-chlordane , cis-heptachlorepoxide were the other main OCPs detected .
Mean levels of \u03a3PCB congeners and WHO(PCB)-TEQ were 9.94 and 0.001 ng/g lipid , respectively .
PCB 153 showed the highest concentration ( 3.37 ng/g lipid ) , followed by PCB 138 and 180 .
For the dioxin-like PCBs , PCB 118 was the dominant ( 0.97 ng/g lipid ) .
Naphthalene , phenanthrene , pyrene and fluoranthene were the major PAHs among the 16 PAHs detected .
The estimated daily intakes of DDTs , PCBs , HCHs and HCB were not exceeded the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) proposed by the Health Canada Guideline .
These results indicate that the neonates of Mersin city are exposed to persistent organic pollutants analyzed in this study .
However , neonates born in Mersin province are less exposed than the ones born in other regions , considering OCP and PCB levels in breast milk .
