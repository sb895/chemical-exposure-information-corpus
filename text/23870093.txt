INTRODUCTION Early life exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA ) , an endocrine disrupting chemical used in some food and beverage containers , receipts , and dental sealants , has been associated with anxiety and hyperactivity in animal studies .
A few human studies also show prenatal and childhood BPA exposure to be associated with behavior problems in children .
METHODS We measured BPA in urine from mothers during pregnancy and children at 5 years of age ( N=292 ) .
Child behavior was assessed by mother and teacher report at age 7 years and direct assessment at age 9 years .
RESULTS Prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with increased internalizing problems in boys , including anxiety and depression , at age 7 .
No associations were seen with prenatal BPA concentrations and behaviors in girls .
Childhood urinary BPA concentrations were associated with increased externalizing behaviors , including conduct problems , in girls at age 7 and increased internalizing behaviors and inattention and hyperactivity behaviors in boys and girls at age 7 .
CONCLUSIONS This study adds to the existing literature showing associations of early life BPA exposure with behavior problems , including anxiety , depression , and hyperactivity in children .
Additional information about timing of exposure and sex differences in effect is still needed .
