The levels of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in adipose tissue samples from the mammary glands of 123 women living in Cordoba ( Spain ) were evaluated .
The influence of alimentary habits , age and previous and present occupation on the tissue levels of PCBs were also investigated .
The compound found at the highest concentration was PCB 180 ( 0.134 microg/g ) , followed by the congeners 153 ( 0.121 microg/g ) , 138 ( 0.102 microg/g ) , 187 ( 0.047 microg/g ) , 170 ( 0.046 microg/g ) , 28 ( 0.039 microg/g ) , 118 ( 0.023 microg/g ) , 183 ( 0.020 microg/g ) , 52 ( 0.011 microg/g ) , 188 ( 0.011 microg/g ) , and 101 ( 0.002 microg/g ) .
A positive correlation was found between donor age and tissue levels of PCBs 28 , 118 , 138 , 153 , 170 , 180 , 183 and 187 .
Conversely , age had no influence on tissue levels of PCBs 52 and 101 .
The majority of donors ( 40.65% ) reported fruits as the most consumed food , followed by mixed food ( 34.15% ) , legumes and root vegetables ( 6.5% ) , stewed meat and vegetables ( 6.5% ) , leafy vegetables ( 4.88% ) , milk ( 3.25% ) , fish ( 2.44% ) and meat ( 1.63% ) .
" Farmer " ( 38% ) and " housewife " ( 38% ) were the most frequent previous occupations , followed by " other activities " ( 24% ) , while " housewife " was the most frequent present occupation ( 67% ) , followed by " other activities " ( 24% ) and " farmer " ( 9% ) .
No significant correlation was observed between tissue levels of PCBs and alimentary habits or previous or present occupation of donors .
