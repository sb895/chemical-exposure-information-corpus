In August , 1990 , a regional transit authority began removing paint on two overhead bridges on a commuter railroad line running through a residential neighborhood of Lynn , Massachusetts , an industrial city north of Boston .
The contracted work involved the sandblasting of existing bridge paint to prepare the surface for repainting .
The sandblasting was conducted without shrouding or adequate worker protection .
The bridge paint was not tested for lead content , nor were neighborhood residents informed of the operations prior to the commencement of the work .
Following complaints by residents to the local and state health departments , a cease-work order was issued .
Laboratory tests of paint samples revealed a lead content ranging from 5% to 15% .
Sandblasting debris was evident throughout the adjacent neighborhood .
What followed was a 3-month effort by state and local government officials and the transit authority and its contractors to assess , communicate , and remedy the damage done by the operations .
Soil , dust , and blood samples were collected to assess environmental contamination and health effects .
Notices were sent , meetings held , and informational sites established to inform community residents of the impact of the operations and remediation efforts .
The local and Boston media provided extensive coverage of the incident and its aftermath .
Remediation efforts involved the relocation of occupants from residences in proximity of the site and extensive clean-up of the interiors of affected homes by licensed lead abatement contractors .
The cost of the cleanup was well over $1 million.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
