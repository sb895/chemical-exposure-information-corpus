The biological specimen bank was initiated by the department of Environmental Medicine and the department of Medicine at the University of Ume√• in 1975 .
The aims of the bank are to collect information on trace elements in human organs .
Special attention is focused on the influence of occupational exposure .
Tissue samples are taken from deceased workers from a copper and lead smelter in northern Sweden .
Control specimens have been collected from deceased normal individuals from four control areas .
Lung , liver and kidney samples are collected with quartz instruments and stored in quartz ampoules to avoid contamination .
Other samples , e.g. bone , brain , fat , hair , heart muscle , nails , skin and stomach are taken with common autopsy instruments and stored in acid-washed polyethene vessels .
The samples are stored at -20 degrees C. The elements Sb , As , Cd , Cr , Co , La and Se are analyzed by neutron activation analysis , Pb and Zn by atomic absorption spectrophotometry .
The findings over time can be related to a number of factors : normal values in tissues , airborne exposure and causes of death .
Special attention is paid variation over time , reevaluation of threshold limit values and risk assessment .
