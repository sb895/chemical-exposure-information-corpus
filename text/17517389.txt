A wood treatment facility operating in southern Alabama released dioxins and other hazardous substances into the surrounding community over a period of approximately 35 years .
The facility used a variety of chemical insecticides including pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) , chromated copper arsenate ( CCA ) , and creosote ( which contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) ) to treat wood .
The health risks associated with the released contaminants are numerous and significant .
To evaluate the historic exposure to the contaminants from the facility , blood samples and health surveys were collected from 21 current and past residents of the adjacent , isolated community and analyzed for concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( dioxins ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( furans ) .
In addition , attic dust sampling was performed in 11 buildings located within a 1-mile radius of the former wood treatment facility .
The average total dioxin toxic equivalent ( TEQ ) concentration in the residents ' blood samples was 36.6 pg/g lipids .
In the attic dust , the average total dioxin TEQ concentration , benzo[a]pyrene ( PAH ) TEQ concentration , and arsenic concentration were 145 ng/kg , 0.98 and 29.8 mg/kg , respectively .
The concentrations of dioxins measured in the blood samples exceed the 90th percentile total dioxin levels found in the general US adult population .
Concentrations of dioxin , arsenic , and PAHs found in the attic samples exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency ( USEPA ) Region 4 soil exposure cancer risk preliminary remediation goal ( PRG ) values .
These findings indicate a very significant potential for related health effects in these communities .
