Risk behavior and environmental sources of exposure to arsenic for 10-year-old schoolchildren were studied in a high exposure area and a low exposure area of Ron Phibun Subdistrict , Ron Phibun District , Nakhon Si Thammarat Province and compared to those in a control area .
Arsenic concentrations of surface soil , ambient air and drinking water to which subjects in the high exposure group , the low exposure group and the control group were exposed , were significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) .
Similarly , urinary concentrations of total arsenic and the sum of inorganic arsenic and its metabolites were significantly higher in the study groups than the control group .
The arsenic content of locally grown agricultural produce was small with the exception of freshwater snails ( Sinotaia ingallsiana ) .
Drinking water and surface soil were found to be the main sources of exposure .
The exposure was mediated by the subjects ' risk behavior , such as playing with soil and no hand-washing before eating .
The estimated cancer risk from arsenic for the schoolchildren in the study area was between 10(-5)-10(-6) which meant that their risk of developing cancer was probable .
Measures to reduce the cancer risk are recommended .
