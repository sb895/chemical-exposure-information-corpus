We used two methods to collect data on indoor smoking exposure of 3-month-old infants .
First , parents of approximately 100 children completed a questionnaire .
We then measured nicotine in the air of the living rooms in smoking and non-smoking households with a passive sampler for a period of 2 weeks , several months after the questionnaire had been completed .
Smoking habits reported in the questionnaire generally with reported number of cigarettes smoked during the measurement weeks , and with nicotine concentrations in the air .
These results suggest that exposure classification based on questionnaire data is likely to be reasonably valid .
