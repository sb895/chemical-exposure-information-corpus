PURPOSE This study evaluated the arsenic methylation profile of adolescents and explored the influence of body mass index ( BMI ) on the arsenic methylation profile of adolescents in an area of Taiwan with no-obvious arsenic exposure .
METHODS This study evaluated 202 normal weight students and 101 obese students from eight elementary schools , recruited from September 2009 to December 2009 .
Concentrations of urinary arsenic species , including inorganic arsenic , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA(5+) ) and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA(5+) ) were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography-linked hydride generator and atomic absorption spectrometry .
RESULTS Urinary total arsenic was significantly decreased with increasing BMI , indicating that obese children may retain higher levels of arsenic in the body , as compared to normal weight children .
Participants with obesity accompanied by high insulin levels had higher inorganic arsenic , significantly higher MMA percentage and significantly lower DMA percentage than those with obesity and low insulin levels .
It seems children with obesity and high insulin levels had lower arsenic methylation capacity than those with obesity and low insulin .
CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to demonstrate that total urinary arsenic is negatively associated with the BMI in adolescents in Taiwan , adjusted for age and sex .
Obese adolescents with high insulin levels had significantly higher MMA% and significantly lower DMA% than obese adolescents with low insulin .
