During May-September 1999 human hair samples were collected from the village of Caimito , a fishing community of the state of Sucre ( Colombia ) , in the San Jorge River basin area , and analyzed for total mercury ( t-Hg ) by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy .
T-Hg was measured in both male and female people aged 15-65 years , whose diet mainly consists of fish collected in nearby marshes .
Average hair t-Hg concentration in people from Caimito was 4.91 +/- 0.55 microg/g ( n = 94 ) , similar to the value previously detected in fishermen living in the gold mining area , 50 km east .
Males had similar t-Hg concentrations ( 4.31 +/- 0.42 microg/g ; n = 56 ) to females ( 5.78 +/- 1.21 microg/g ; n = 38 ) and there was no difference in t-Hg levels between groups of different age .
Mercury content in hair was weakly but significantly associated ( R = 0.20 , P = 0.05 ) with fish consumption .
