Chlorpyrifos ( CPF ) is applied seasonally in Egypt by adolescent agricultural workers and the extent of occupational exposure and the potential for environmental CPF exposure in this population is poorly understood .
Adolescent pesticide applicators ( n=57 ; 12-21 years of age ) and age-matched non-applicators ( n=38 ) from the same villages were followed for 10 months in 2010 , spanning pre-application through post-application .
Eight urine and five blood samples were collected from participants within this time period .
Blood acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ; exposure/effect biomarker ) and urine 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TCPy ; exposure biomarker ) were used to assess occupational CPF exposures in pesticide applicators and environmental exposures in non-applicators .
Applicators demonstrated significantly higher TCPy concentration and BChE depression than non-applicators throughout CPF application .
This difference persisted for 4-7 weeks after the cessation of agricultural spraying .
However , both groups exhibited significantly elevated TCPy and depressed BChE , compared with their respective baseline .
The peak TCPy levels during the spray season ( 95% confidence interval ( CI) ) for non-applicators and applicators reached 16.8 ( 9.87-28.5 ) and 137 ( 57.4-329)\u2009ug/g creatinine , respectively .
BChE levels ( 95% CIs ) during the spray were as follows : 1.47 ( 1.28-1.68 ) for non-applicators and 0.47 ( 0.24-0.94)\u2009U/ml for applicators .
The longitudinal assessment of CPF biomarkers provided robust measures of exposure and effect throughout CPF application in adolescents and revealed significant exposures in both applicators and non-applicators .
Biomarker data in the non-applicators , which mirrored that of the applicators , indicated that non-applicators received environmental CPF exposures .
This suggests that similar exposures may occur in other residents of this region during periods of pesticide application .
