We conducted congener-specific analysis of non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( non-dioxin-like PCBs ) in blood collected in February 2004 from 127 elderly residents living in Nakagawa Town , Fukuoka Prefecture , Japan .
The present study is one of the few studies in which 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners were measured in human blood .
Of the 127 elderly residents , 51 were men ( mean : 68.1 years ) and 76 were women ( mean : 68.1 years ) .
Among 197 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners , 56 were identified in the blood of elderly residents .
The arithmetic mean total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners in the blood of elderly men and women in Nakagawa Town were 419 ( median : 378 ) and 363 ( median : 323)ngg(-1)lipid , respectively , and the concentrations were in the range of 172-1102 and 119-1226ngg(-1)lipid , respectively , indicating that the total concentrations in elderly men are significantly higher than those in elderly women .
The contamination of non-dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of elderly men and women in Fukuoka Prefecture was found to have decreased compared to past levels .
The ratios of hexachlorinated biphenyls ( hexaCBs ) to the total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners in the blood of elderly men and women were 44.6% and 45.6% , respectively , which was particularly high compared with those of other congeners. 2,2',4,4',5,5'-HexaCB ( #153 ) among hexaCBs congeners , the most abundant congener in the blood of elderly men and women , contributed approximately 23.0% and 23.5% to the total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners , respectively .
Furthermore , 2,2',3,4,4',5'-hexaCB ( #138 ) , 2,3,3',4',5,6-hexaCB ( #163)/2,3,3',4',5',6-hexaCB ( #164 ) , 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptaCB ( #180 ) , and 2,2',3,4,4',5,6'-heptaCB ( #182)/2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptaCB ( #187 ) also showed high ratios to the total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners detected in the blood of elderly men and women .
A statistical examination of the relationship between the total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners in blood and the age of elderly residents who were over 60 years indicated statistically significant correlations between the total concentrations of these PCBs congeners and the age of elderly women .
However , similar correlations were not observed in elderly men .
The results of the present study have indicated the current levels of non-dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of elderly men and women in Fukuoka Prefecture , Japan and can be used as baseline data for those over age 60 .
