Fish are abundant and important dietary items for the Amer-Indians , and total hair-Hg ( HHg ) concentration is a reliable marker of fish consumption .
We studied the impact of fish consumption ( HHg ) on the nutritional status of Indian children of Eastern Amazonia .
Weight-for-height Z score ( WHZ ) was measured , and HHg was determined in 203 children younger than 10 years of age in three villages .
There was significantly higher fish consumption in Kayabi children ( 16.55 microg Hg/g ; SD , 11.44 ) than in children of the Munduruku villages of Missão-Cururu ( 4.76 microg Hg/g ; SD , 2.09 ) and Kaburua ( 2.87 microg Hg/g ; SD , 2.13 ) .
Anthropometric indices showed WHZ means of -0.27 , -0.22 , and 0.40 , respectively , for Kayabi , Missão-Cururu and Kaburua villages .
Despite a different pattern of fish-protein consumption between tribes , there was no significant correlation between WHZ and HHg concentrations ( r2 = 0.0079 ; P < 0.2021 ) .
Dietary differences among Amazonian tribes can be traced and used in measuring health outcomes .
Higher fish consumption , although important for Kayabis , was compensated by other protein sources by the Kaburua villagers .
