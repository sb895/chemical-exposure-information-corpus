Organochlorines are persistent lipophilic compounds that accumulate in Inuit people living in circumpolar countries .
Organochlorines accumulate as a result of the Inuits ' large consumption of sea mammal fat ; however , available data are limited to blood lipids , milk fat , and adipose tissue .
We report results of organochlorine determination in liver , brain , omental fat , and subcutaneous abdominal fat samples collected from deceased Greenlanders between 1992 and 1994 .
Eleven chlorinated pesticides and 14 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners were measured in tissue lipid extracts by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection .
Mean concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls , 2 , 2'-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene , ss-hexachlorocyclohexane , hexachlorobenzene , mirex , trans-nonachlor , and oxychlordane in adipose tissue samples from Greenlanders were 3-34-fold higher than those measured using the same analytical method in samples from Canadians in Quebec City , Quebec .
Brain lipids contained lower concentrations of all organochlorines than lipids extracted from other tissues .
Organochlorine residue levels in lipid extracts from liver , omental fat , and subcutaneous abdominal fat samples were similar , with the exception of ss-hexachlorocyclohexane , which reached a greater concentration in liver lipids than in lipids from both adipose tissues ( 4-fold ; p < 0. 05 ) .
Comparisons with available international data on adipose tissue levels reveal that the organochlorine body burden in the Inuit population of Greenland is presently among the highest resulting from environmental exposure .
