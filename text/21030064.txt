In order to assess potential risks of exposure to environmental chemicals , more information on concomitant exposure to different chemicals is needed .
We present data on chemicals in human milk of a cohort study ( 2004 , 2005 , 2006 ) of 54 mother/child pairs , where for the first time , cosmetic UV filters , synthetic musks , parabens and phthalate metabolites were analyzed in the same sample along with persistent organochlor pollutants ( POPs ) , i.e. , organochlor pesticides and metabolites , polybrominated diphenylethers and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .
The two groups of chemicals exhibited different exposure patterns .
Six out of seven PCB congeners and a majority of pesticides were present in all milk samples , with significant correlations between certain PCB congener and pesticide levels , whereas the cosmetic-derived compounds , UV filters , parabens and synthetic musks , exhibited a more variable exposure pattern with inter-individual differences .
UV filters were present in 85.2% of milk samples , in the range of PCB levels .
Comparison with a questionnaire revealed a significant correlation between use of products containing UV filters and their presence in milk for two frequently used and detected UV filters , 4-methylbenzylidene camphor and octocrylene , and for the whole group of UV filters .
Concentrations of PCBs and organochlor pesticides were within ranges seen in Western and Southern European countries .
For several POPs , mean and/or maximum daily intake calculated from individual concentrations was above recent US EPA reference dose values .
Our data emphasize the need for analyses of complex mixtures to obtain more information on inter-individual and temporal variability of human exposure to different types of chemicals .
