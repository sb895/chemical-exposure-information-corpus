Phthalates are a family of multifunctional chemicals widely used in personal care and other consumer products .
The ubiquitous use of phthalates results in human exposure through multiple sources and routes , including dietary ingestion , dermal absorption , inhalation , and parenteral exposure from medical devices containing phthalates .
We explored the temporal variability over 3 months in urinary phthalate metabolite levels among 11 men who collected up to nine urine samples each during this time period .
Eight phthalate metabolites were measured by solid-phase extraction-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry .
Statistical analyses were performed to determine the between- and within-subject variance apportionment , and the sensitivity and specificity of a single urine sample to classify a subject's 3-month average exposure .
Five of the eight phthalates were frequently detected .
Monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) was detected in 100% of samples ; monobutyl phthalate , monobenzyl phthalate , mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( MEHP ) , and monomethyl phthalate were detected in > 90% of samples .
Although we found both substantial day-to-day and month-to-month variability in each individual's urinary phthalate metabolite levels , a single urine sample was moderately predictive of each subject's exposure over 3 months .
The sensitivities ranged from 0.56 to 0.74 .
Both the degree of between- and within-subject variance and the predictive ability of a single urine sample differed among phthalate metabolites .
In particular , a single urine sample was most predictive for MEP and least predictive for MEHP .
These results suggest that the most efficient exposure assessment strategy for a particular study may depend on the phthalates of interest .
