BACKGROUND Prenatal exposure to mercury has been associated with adverse childhood neurologic outcomes in epidemiologic studies .
Dose-response information for this relationship is useful for estimating benefits of reduced mercury exposure .
OBJECTIVES We estimated a dose-response relationship between maternal mercury body burden and subsequent childhood decrements in intelligence quotient ( IQ ) , using a Bayesian hierarchical model to integrate data from three epidemiologic studies .
METHODS Inputs to the model consist of dose-response coefficients from studies conducted in the Faroe Islands , New Zealand , and the Seychelles Islands .
IQ coefficients were available from previous work for the latter two studies , and a coefficient for the Faroe Islands study was estimated from three IQ subtests .
Other tests of cognition/achievement were included in the hierarchical model to obtain more accurate estimates of study-to-study and end point-to-end point variability .
RESULTS We find a central estimate of -0.18 IQ points ( 95% confidence interval , -0.378 to -0.009 ) for each parts per million increase of maternal hair mercury , similar to the estimates for both the Faroe Islands and Seychelles studies , and lower in magnitude than the estimate for the New Zealand study .
Sensitivity analyses produce similar results , with the IQ coefficient central estimate ranging from -0.13 to -0.25 .
CONCLUSIONS IQ is a useful end point for estimating neurodevelopmental effects , but may not fully represent cognitive deficits associated with mercury exposure , and does not represent deficits related to attention and motor skills .
Nevertheless , the integrated IQ coefficient provides a more robust description of the dose-response relationship for prenatal mercury exposure and cognitive functioning than results of any single study .
