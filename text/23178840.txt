Paired human breast milk and scalp hair samples ( n=30 ) were obtained in 2008 from primipara and multipara mothers living in two locations in the Philippines viz. , Payatas , a waste dumpsite , and Malate , a non-dumpsite .
Samples were analyzed for three groups of organohalogenated compounds , such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs ) .
PCBs were the predominantly identified compounds ( median : 70 ng/g lipid wt. ) in all the breast milk samples .
In the human milk , CB-153 was the most dominant PCB congener ( 17-44% contribution to the sum PCB ) , closely followed by CB-138 ( 12-35% ) , CB-118 ( 4-12% ) , CB-180 ( 2-13% ) , CB-187 ( 3-13% ) , and CB-170 ( 1.5-10% ) .
Levels of PBDEs ( median : 3.0 ng/g lipid wt. ) in human milk samples from the Philippines were similar to other Asian or European countries .
BDE-47 , -99 , -100 and -153 were the major PBDE congeners .
For HBCDs , the \u03b1-isomer was predominant followed by the \u03b3-HBCD isomer in the both locations .
PBDE levels in human milk were significantly higher in the dumpsite ( 3.9 ng/g lipid wt. ) than in the non-dump site ( 2.2 ng/g lipid wt. ) .
PBDE concentrations ( including BDE-209 ) were significantly higher ( median : 70 ng/g hair ) than those of PCBs ( median : 30 ng/g hair ) and HBCDs ( median : 1.0 ng/g hair ) in all the scalp hair samples .
To our knowledge , this is the first report on HBCDs in human scalp hair .
PBDE congeners in scalp hair were dominated by BDE-209 and BDE-47 .
On a congener basis , the levels of PBDEs found in scalp hair were higher than those in Spain ( children and adults ) and China ( general people ) .
PCB levels found in scalp hair were higher than those in Greece , Romania and Belgium , but lower than those in China .
In this study , there were no significant differences in the concentration of PCBs and HBCDs in human milk ; and PCBs , HBCDs and PBDEs in human scalp hair from the two different locations .
No significant correlations were observed between PCBs , PBDEs and HBCDs levels and age of mothers in this study , which may be due to the small number of samples .
Furthermore , there was no correlation between milk and hair levels for more persistent compounds ( PCB-153 , PCB-138 , or BDE-47 ) , and thus it is worthy to follow-up in future studies along with more number of samples .
This is the first report to provide measurement data for PCBs , PBDEs and HBCDs in paired milk and hair of populations in the Philippines .
