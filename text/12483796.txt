Small-scale gold mining in the Brazilian Amazon occurs in areas with high rates of malaria transmission .
Amazonian populations can be exposed to mercury through direct contact with the mining process and/or through fish consumption .
Because of data from experimental studies , we examined the potential for mercury to affect host response to malaria .
A cross-sectional survey was done in Jacareacanga , a riverine community in Para state , in a region of intense alluvial gold mining .
A sample of 205 persons was selected by cluster sampling from the total population of approximately 2000 .
A brief medical history and exam were conducted , malaria slides were obtained , and hair samples were taken to measure mercury levels .
The average hair mercury level was 8.6 micrograms/g , ranging from 0.3 to 83.2 micrograms/g .
The most important predictors of elevated mercury levels were high fish consumption and low income .
Although there was no prevalent malaria , the odds of reporting a past malaria infection was four times higher for those also reporting a history of working with mercury .
