In the present study , the hair of pregnant women was sampled between November 2007 and January 2008 in Ahvaz and Noushahr cities and the countryside of Noushahr , Iran .
They were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) , such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) and its metabolites , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , \u03b1- , \u03b2- , and \u03b3-hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) isomers and seven polychlorinated ( PCBs ) congeners ( IUPAC Nos. 28 , 52 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 and 180 ) .
Significant differences between the concentrations of investigated pollutants were found between the locations ( p<0.05 ) .
For HCHs , the \u03b3-HCH isomer was measured at higher mean concentrations ( 6 ng g(-1) hair ) compared to the \u03b2-HCH isomer ( 0.03 ng g(-1) ) , which generally is the most prevalent HCH in biological matrices .
Very high mean concentrations of p,p'-DDT in countryside of Noushahr ( 24 ng g(-1) ) combined with lower values ( 0.6 ) of ratio p,p'-DDE/p,p'-DDT in the hair samples suggest recent exposure to " fresh " DDT in this region .
Significant differences in OCPs and PCBs were found between primiparous and multiparous mothers ( p<0.05 ) .
There was no correlation between levels of OCPs and PCBs in the hair of Iranian pregnant women and their age .
There was a significant difference ( p<0.05 ) in the organochlorine levels , including HCHs , between mothers who have eaten fish once a week and those who consumed fish more than once per week in Noushahr .
