We reported increased rates of childhood asthma and worsening of preexisting asthma in Chinatown near the World Trade Center ( WTC ) after September 11 , 2001 .
This conclusion was corroborated by the WTC Health Registry in 2003 , which showed asthma prevalence in children <5 years old was higher than national estimates .
In 2002 , ethnic Chinese in New York City ( NYC ) , based on 2000 U.S. Census addresses , were reported to have the lowest levels of asthma compared with other ethnic NYC neighborhoods .
This study was designed to determine if Chinatown asthma rates are still higher than other ethnic neighborhoods and if rates decreased since 2003 .
We surveyed 353 parents of children at a Chinatown elementary school , conducted spirometry on 202 students , measured air pollution ( PM2.5 ) , and sampled dust from the floor of the school during 2008 for concentrations of dust-mite antigens , cat , rat , mouse , and cockroach .
Asthma rates of 14.4% were reported in children who refused spirometry if they lived <1 mi from the WTC .
The rate was 4.9% if they lived farther away .
Twenty-nine percent of all students ( 4-12 years old ) who had spirometry showed a forced expiratory volume at 1 second ( FEV(1) ) of <80% predicted normal .
Among children who were alive in 2001 , 17.4% had an FEV(1) of < or = 75% predicted .
The concentration of PM2.5 reached a high level of 40 microg/m(3) .
Indoor aeroallergen concentrations were negligible .
Chinatown asthma rates are still higher than among other groups ( 29% versus the NYC reference rate of 13% ) .
High air pollution levels may account for increased asthma incidence .
It is possible that exposure to toxins on September 11 , 2001 accentuated the effect of subsequent exposure to air pollution .
