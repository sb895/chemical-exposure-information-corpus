Consumption of sport-caught fish contaminated with high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) may pose human health risks .
To obtain estimates of fish consumption and fishing behaviors in recreational fishermen in Virginia , on-site interviews ( n=143 ; 134 men and 9 women ) were conducted at seven public boat landings along the James River .
Using existing PCB concentration data from James River fish tissue samples collected from 1997 , and 1999 to 2001 , default and point estimates were calculated and Monte Carlo analyses conducted to estimate potential risks under different consumption scenarios .
A mean of 55 fish meals/yr and 14 James River sport-caught fish ( JRSCF ) meals/yr were reported .
Caucasians fished less often ( mean of 58 d ) , consumed less fish ( mean of 43 meals/yr ) and had smaller portion sizes ( mean of 11.7 oz ) compared to other races combined ( 130 d ; 82 meals/yr ; and 15.6 oz ) .
On average , respondents reported consuming 10 meals of James River catfish a year ( 5 kg/yr ) .
Risk estimates produced from Monte Carlo analysis were consistently lower than the default and point estimates .
Several individuals exceeded acceptable risk levels and the mean cancer and non-cancer risks among catfish consumers exceeded acceptable levels .
Eighteen percent of individuals had no knowledge of fish advisories in Virginia and 4% of the subjects indicated they would consume fish under advisory .
Based on reported consumption , a significant risk to recreational fishermen , as a result of consuming PCB-contaminated catfish , was found .
Risks associated with consuming other species were within acceptable limits .
