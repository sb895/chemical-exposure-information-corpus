People in developing countries are often considered at greater risk of mercury ( Hg ) poisoning due to a variety of factors including a lack of awareness regarding their occupational risks .
Individuals requiring urine mercury ( U-Hg ) analysis at the Center for Toxicological Investigations of the University of Carabobo ( CITUC ) , between 1998 and 2002 were studied to identify demographic characteristics associated to U-Hg levels .
The studied population included individuals with a history of exposure ( or related exposures ) to Hg processes , and was comprised of 1159 individuals ( 65 children , 1094 adults ) ages 0.58-79 years old , mean 36.63+/-12.4 .
Children's geometric mean U-Hg levels were 2.73 microg/g Creatinine ( Ct ) and in adults 2.55 microg/g Ct .
The highest frequency of adults ' occupations were shipyard workers ( 35.47% ) , dentists ( 23.5% ) , lab technicians ( 11.43% ) , dental employees 10.42% and miners ( 10.2% ) .
Chemical laboratory technicians had the highest mean U-Hg ( 4.46 microg/g Ct ) .
Mean U-Hg levels in female adults ( 3.45 microg/g Ct ) were statistically superior to levels in male adults ( 2.15 microg/g Ct ) .
Two of the 172 women in reproductive age , had U-Hg levels higher than 78 microg/g Ct .
Individuals from Falcon State were found to have the highest mean U-Hg ( 4.53 microg/g Ct ) .
U-Hg levels higher than permissible limits were found in only 2 states ( Carabobo and Bolivar ) with a total of 24 cases .
Although the results of this investigation were highly variable , the findings can be used to examine circumstances which influence mercury toxicity trends , and possibly used in future studies working to identify Hg exposures .
