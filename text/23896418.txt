A variety of metals are important for biological function but have also been shown to impact health at elevated concentrations , whereas others have no known biological function .
Pregnant women are a vulnerable population and measures to reduce exposure in this group are important .
We undertook a study of maternal exposure to the metals , aluminium , arsenic , copper , cobalt , chromium , lithium , manganese , nickel , selenium , tin , uranium and zinc in 173 participants across Western Australia .
Each participant provided a whole blood and urine sample , as well as drinking water , residential soil and dust samples and completed a questionnaire .
In general the concentrations of metals in all samples were low with the notable exception of uranium ( blood U mean 0.07 µg/L , range <0.01-0.25 µg/L ; urinary U mean 0.018 µg/g creatinine , range <0.01-0.199 µg/g creatinine ) .
Factors that influenced biological concentrations were consumption of fish which increased urinary arsenic concentrations , hobbies ( including mechanics and welding ) which increased blood manganese concentrations and iron/folic acid supplement use which was associated with decreased concentrations of aluminium and nickel in urine and manganese in blood .
Environmental concentrations of aluminium , copper and lithium were found to influence biological concentrations , but this was not the case for other environmental metals concentrations .
Further work is underway to explore the influence of diet on biological metals concentrations in more detail .
The high concentrations of uranium require further investigation .
