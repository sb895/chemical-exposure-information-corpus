BACKGROUND A relationship between betel quid chewing in Bangladeshi populations and the development of skin lesions and tremor has been previously reported , for people exposed to high levels of arsenic ( As ) through drinking contaminated groundwater .
Exposure to manganese ( Mn ) is also known to induce neurotoxicity and levels of Mn in Bangladeshi groundwater are also high .
The present study evaluates betel quid chewing as an overlooked source of Mn exposure in a Bangladeshi population .
METHODS Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) was used to determine ( 1 ) urinary Mn levels for 15 chewers and 22 non-chewers from the ethnic Bangladeshi community in the United Kingdom , and ( 2 ) Mn levels in betel quids , its individual components and other Bangladeshi foods .
RESULTS Betel quid chewers displayed a significantly higher ( P = 0.009 ) mean Mn concentration in urine ( 1.93 \u03bcg L(-1) ) compared to non-chewers ( 0.62 \u03bcg L(-1) ) .
High levels of Mn were detected in Piper betel leaves with an overall average of 135 mg kg(-1) ( range 26 -518 mg kg(-1) ) .
The mean concentration of Mn in betel quid was 41 mg kg(-1) ( SD 27 ) and the daily intake of Mn in the Bangladeshi population was estimated to be 20.3 mg/day .
Chewing six betel quids could contribute up to 18% of the maximum recommended daily intake of Mn .
CONCLUSION We have demonstrated that Mn in betel quids is an overlooked source of exposure to Mn in humans .
Chewers display a 3.1 fold increased urinary Mn concentration compared to non-chewers .
The practice of betel quid chewing contributes a high proportion of the maximum recommended daily intake of Mn , which could make chewers in Bangladesh more vulnerable to Mn neurotoxicity .
