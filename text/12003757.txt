We determined levels of inorganic mercury ( I-Hg ) and methylmercury in placentas from 119 Swedish women , not selected with respect to high exposure of mercury .
Our objective was to relate placental Hg species with maternal and fetal blood concentrations and to evaluate possible associations with selenium .
We performed the analyses using automated alkaline solubilization/reduction and cold-vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry .
I-Hg levels in placenta increased with an increasing number of maternal dental amalgam fillings ( p < 0.001 ) .
Despite placental accumulation ( median , 1.3 microg/kg ; range , 0.18-6.7 microg/kg wet weight ) , a substantial fraction of maternal blood I-Hg , probably as Hg(0) , reached the fetus .
Although MeHg transferred easily to the fetus , it also accumulated in the placenta .
On average , 60% of placental Hg was in the form of MeHg .
The median concentration was 1.8 microg/kg ( range , 0-6.2 microg/kg wet weight ) , more than twice the maternal blood concentration .
We found significant associations between MeHg and selenium in both maternal and umbilical cord blood but not in the placenta .
The associations were particularly obvious in freshwater fish consumers , probably reflecting that fish is a source of both MeHg and selenium .
We found no correlations between I-Hg and selenium .
This study increases the understanding of Hg , in its different forms , in human placenta and how they are related to maternal and fetal exposure .
