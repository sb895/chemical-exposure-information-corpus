Accumulation of metals in soil represents a health risk for individuals living near mining areas , especially for children who have a higher susceptibility to metal related diseases .
The Taxco mining district in Southern Mexico was one of the largest Mexican metal producers of silver and gold , among other metals .
The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate metal exposure on children aged 6-11 years living in and around the Taxco mine tailings zone .
Lead in blood ( PbB ) was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry ( AAS ) .
Urine arsenic ( AsU ) was measured by hydride generation AAS , urinary Hg ( HgU ) by flow injection cold vapor atomic absorption , and urinary concentration of other metals such as chromium ( Cr ) , nickel ( Ni ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , barium ( Ba ) , cobalt ( Co ) , copper ( Cu ) , zinc ( Zn ) , manganese ( Mn ) , molybdenum ( Mo ) , strontium ( Sr ) , and iron ( Fe ) were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry .
Fifty samples were analyzed for PbB , AsU , and HgU , and 35 samples for the other metals .
The mean concentration+/-SD for each metal was : PbB , 9.4+/-3.3 microg/dL ; NiU , 75.4+/-30.7 microg/L ; BaU , 18.4+/-4.1 microg/L ; MnU , 5.2+/-0.7 microg/L ; CuU , 29.6+/-6.8 microg/L ; AsU , 16.5+/-8.3 microg/L ; HgU , 0.7+/-0.86 microg/L ; CdU , 4.7+/-2.7 microg/L ; CrU , 15.1+/-4.45 microg/L ; CoU , 18.3+/-9.7 microg/L ; SrU , 49.2+/-30.7 microg/L ; ZnU , 628.4+/-438.9 microg/L ; FeU , 30.5+/-17.7 microg/L ; and MoU , 52.1+/-29.3 microg/L .
Results of this exploratory study show that children residing in the mining area of Taxco were environmentally exposed to several metals and a high percentage of these children had levels of Ni , Ba , Mn , Cr , Co , Cd , As , Hg , and Pb above reference values .
Thus , further studies are needed to assess the effects of simultaneous exposure to toxic metals in children residing in mining areas .
