Persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) present in the living environment are thought to have detrimental health effects on the population , with pregnant women and the developing foetus being at highest risk .
We report on the levels of selected POPs in maternal blood of 155 delivering women residing in seven regions within the SÃ£o Paulo State , Brazil .
The following selected POPs were measured in the maternal whole blood : 12 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) congeners ( IUPAC Nos. 99 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 , 156 , 163 , 170 , 180 , 183 , 187 , 194 ) ; dichlordiphenyltrichloroethane p,p'-DDT , diphenyldichloroethylene p,p'-DDE and other pesticides such as hexachlorocyclohexanes ( \u03b1-HCH , \u03b2-HCH , \u03b3-HCH ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , chlordane derivatives cis-chlordane , trans-chlordane , oxy-chlordane , cis-nonachlor and trans-nonachlor .
Statistical comparisons between regions were performed only on compounds having concentrations above LOD in 70% of the samples .
PCB118 congener was found to be highest in the industrial site ( mean 4.97 ng/g lipids ) ; PCB138 congener concentration was highest in the Urban 3 site ( mean 4.27 ng/g lipids ) and congener PCB153 was highest in the industrial and Urban 3 sites with mean concentration of 7.2 ng/g lipids and 5.89ng/g lipids respectively .
Large differences in levels of p,p'-DDE between regions were observed with the Urban 3 and industrial sites having the highest concentrations of 645 ng/g lipids and 417 ng/g lipids , respectively ; \u03b2-HCH was found to be highest in the Rural 1 site ; the \u03b3-HCH in Rural 1 and industrial ; the HCB in the Rural 1 and industrial sites and oxy-chlordane and t-NC in the Rural 2 sites .
An association between levels of some contaminants and maternal age and parity was also found .
