The present study investigated the levels of phthalate esters in a total of 86 human milk samples collected among 21 breast-feeding mothers over a 6-month postpartum time .
Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) was the predominant ester with the arithmetic mean value of 222 ng g(-1) ( range : 156-398 ng g(-1) , 95% confidence limit ) , followed by dibutyl phthalate ( DBP ) , 0.87 ( range : 0.62-1.2 ) ng g(-1) .
Diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) , with a mean of 0.31 ng g(-1) , was detected in only a small number of samples .
Weak correlations between lipid content and levels of phthalate esters were observed .
The levels of phthalate esters in human milk fluctuated over the 6-month period ; this may indicate a need for multiple sample collection , to calculate average concentrations over the feeding period .
Multiple sample collection would provide a better estimate of the exposure of breast-fed infants to phthalate in human milk .
For infants relying on breast-feeding , the mean daily intake over the first 6-month period considering a 7 kg infant consuming 750 g of milk was estimated at 167 microg d(-1) for DEHP and less than 1 microg d(-1) for DBP and DEP .
While the nutritional and social benefits of breast-feeding are well established , the potential transfer of phthalate esters from mothers to breast-fed infants should also be recognized .
