BACKGROUND Phthalates may pose a risk for perinatal developmental effects .
An important question relates to the choice of suitable biological matrices for assessing exposure during this period .
OBJECTIVES This study was designed to measure the concentrations of phthalate diesters or their metabolites in breast milk , blood or serum , and urine and to evaluate their suitability for assessing perinatal exposure to phthalates .
METHODS In 2001 , 2-3 weeks after delivery , 42 Swedish primipara provided breast milk , blood , and urine samples at home .
Special care was taken to minimize contamination with phthalates ( e.g. , use of a special breast milk pump , heat treatment of glassware and needles , addition of phosphoric acid ) .
RESULTS Phthalate diesters and metabolites in milk and blood or serum , if detected , were present at concentrations close to the limit of detection .
By contrast , most phthalate metabolites were detectable in urine at concentrations comparable to those from the general population in the United States and in Germany .
No correlations existed between urine concentrations and those found in milk or blood/serum for single phthalate metabolites .
Our data are at odds with a previous study documenting frequent detection and comparatively high concentrations of phthalate metabolites in Finnish and Danish mothers ' milk .
CONCLUSIONS Concentrations of phthalate metabolites in urine are more informative than those in milk or serum .
Furthermore , collection of milk or blood may be associated with discomfort and potential technical problems such as contamination ( unless oxidative metabolites are measured ) .
Although urine is a suitable matrix for health-related phthalate monitoring , urinary concentrations in nursing mothers cannot be used to estimate exposure to phthalates through milk ingestion by breast-fed infants .
