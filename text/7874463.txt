This investigation was made to estimate current normal concentrations of total mercury in the hair of Japanese people .
Hair samples were collected from 365 healthy volunteers in Tokyo and the surrounding areas from June 1992 to June 1993 .
Mercury contents in the samples were analyzed by gold amalgam flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry .
The mean of the concentrations of total mercury in the hairs of the males ( 2.98 ppm , 81 volunteers with an average age of 34.7 , age 11 to 73 ) was higher than that of the females ( 2.02 ppm , 284 volunteers with an average age of 26.5 , age 12 to 82 ) .
In both the male and female , the mean of the concentrations of total mercury in hair increased with age up to their thirties , then gradually decreased .
The concentrations of total mercury in the hair of females at age 18 to 40 showed greater fluctuation , as compared to those of males in the same age groups .
In both males and females , the concentration of total mercury in the hair was higher in volunteers who have a preference to fish in their diet than in those who prefer other foods .
In both males and females , there was no positive correlation between the total hair mercury and the place of residence of the volunteer although the total hair mercury ( 2.30 ppm ) of male volunteers who inhabit Ibaragi and Chiba , in eastern part of Tokyo , facing the Pacific Ocean or both the Pacific Ocean and Tokyo Bay , was lower than those ( 3.30 and 3.25 ppm ) of male volunteers of other two areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
