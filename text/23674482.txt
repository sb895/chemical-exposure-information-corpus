BACKGROUND Metal content in lip products has been an issue of concern .
OBJECTIVES We measured lead and eight other metals in a convenience sample of 32 lip products used by young Asian women in Oakland , California , and assessed potential health risks related to estimated intakes of these metals .
METHODS We analyzed lip products by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and used previous estimates of lip product usage rates to determine daily oral intakes .
We derived acceptable daily intakes ( ADIs ) based on information used to determine public health goals for exposure , and compared ADIs with estimated intakes to assess potential risks .
RESULTS Most of the tested lip products contained high concentrations of titanium and aluminum .
All examined products had detectable manganese .
Lead was detected in 24 products ( 75% ) , with an average concentration of 0.36 Â± 0.39 ppm , including one sample with 1.32 ppm .
When used at the estimated average daily rate , estimated intakes were > 20% of ADIs derived for aluminum , cadmium , chromium , and manganese .
In addition , average daily use of 10 products tested would result in chromium intake exceeding our estimated ADI for chromium .
For high rates of product use ( above the 95th percentile ) , the percentages of samples with estimated metal intakes exceeding ADIs were 3% for aluminum , 68% for chromium , and 22% for manganese .
Estimated intakes of lead were < 20% of ADIs for average and high use .
CONCLUSIONS Cosmetics safety should be assessed not only by the presence of hazardous contents , but also by comparing estimated exposures with health-based standards .
In addition to lead , metals such as aluminum , cadmium , chromium , and manganese require further investigation .
