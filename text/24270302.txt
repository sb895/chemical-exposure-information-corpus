OBJECTIVE We present pulmonary disorders of four employees who were exposed to high concentration of pure mica dust in a muscovite milling unit .
METHOD All cases underwent traditional examinations with a dual-energy chest computed tomographic scan .
An analysis of exhaled breath condensate by Raman microspectrometry and of mineralogical content of a lung biopsy was performed for one case .
RESULTS All cases showed bilateral micronodular ground glass opacities and mediastinal and hilar hyperdense lymph nodes consistent with the nodal sequestration of mineral particles .
Histological analysis showed giant cell granulomas without typical silicotic nodule with high concentration of birefringent particles consistent with mica .
Mica particles found in the exhaled breath condensate were identical to particles in ambient air at the company .
CONCLUSION Occupational exposure to mica dust is responsible for diffuse infiltrative lung disease by overload processes .
