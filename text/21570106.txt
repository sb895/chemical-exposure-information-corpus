The association between oxidative stress and exposure to environmental chemicals was assessed in a group of Japanese preschool children .
The concentrations of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , 1-hydroxypyrene ( 1-OHP ) , inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) and monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , and cotinine in spot urine samples , collected from 134 children ( 3-6 yrs ) from a kindergarten in Kanagawa , Japan , were measured as biomarkers of oxidative stress or exposure to environmental chemicals .
For 76 subjects of the 134 , intakes of anti-oxidant nutrients ( vitamins A , C , and E , manganese , copper , zinc and selenium ( Se) ) were estimated from a food consumption survey carried out 2-4 weeks after urine sampling and by urine analysis ( Se ) .
The median ( min-max ) creatinine-corrected concentrations of urinary biomarkers were 4.45 ( 1.98-12.3 ) , 0.127 ( 0.04-2.41 ) , 4.78 ( 1.18-12.7 ) , and 0.62 ( <0.6-19.0 ) \u03bcg/g cre for 8-OHdG , 1-OHP , iAs+MMA , and cotinine , respectively .
Multiple regression analysis was carried out using 8-OHdG concentration as a dependent variable and urinary biomarkers of exposure and Se intake , intakes of vitamins and biological attributes of the subjects as independent variables .
To explain 8-OHdG concentrations , intake of vitamin A and age were significant variables with negative coefficients , while 1-OHP concentration had a positive coefficient .
These results indicated that oxidative stress of children is affected by chemical exposure at environmental levels , by nutrient intake and by physiological factors in a complex manner .
On the other hand , unstable statistical results due to sub-grouping of subject , based on the availability of food consumption data , were found : the present results should further be validated by future studies with suitable research design .
