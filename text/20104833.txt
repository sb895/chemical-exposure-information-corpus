The study described here was comprised of 100 pregnant females from two prenatal care units at the cities of Hassleholm and Simrishamn in southern Sweden .
It included a questionnaire as well as whole blood ( total mercury , cadmium , and lead ) and hair ( total mercury ) sampling ( collection period 2002-2003 ) .
The median values of total mercury ( B-Hg 0.70 microg/L ; range 0.27-2.1 microg/L ) , cadmium ( 0.30 microg/L , 0.05-4.8 microg/L ) and lead ( 11.0 microg/L , 4.2-79 microg/L ) in whole blood were low in the total material , as were the hair mercury concentrations ( Hair-Hg 0.22 microg/g , 0.04-0.83 microg/g ) .
In a multiple linear regression model , B-Hg was related to the number of fish meals per week and to the number of occlusal amalgam fillings ( multiple r = 0.51 ; p < .001 ) .
The levels of mercury , cadmium , and lead in whole blood were lower than suggested biological reference intervals , and did not indicate risks for adverse health effects .
