Small scale miners use mercury to extract gold from ore in many countries .
An environmental and health assessment was performed in Indonesia in two regions , Galangan in Central Kalimantan and Talawaan in Northern Sulawesi .
The environmental assessment showed severe mercury contamination of the sediments , and increased mercury levels in local fish .
For the health investigation 281 volunteers were recruited and examined by a standardized questionnaire , a neurological examination and neuro-psychological tests .
A medical score was used consisting of significant factors of mercury intoxication .
Mercury exposed workers showed typical symptoms of mercury intoxication , such as movement disorders ( ataxia , tremor , dysdiadochokinesia , etc. ) .
Blood , urine and hair samples were taken from any participant and analyzed for mercury .
The mercury concentration in the biomonitors was high , partly extreme high in the working population , increased in the population living in the same habitat and low in the control group .
By a standard protocol which includes a combination of threshold values of mercury in the biomonitors and a medical sum score the diagnosis of chronic mercury intoxication was made for highly burdened workers ( amalgam smelters ) in 55% in Sulawesi and in 62% in Kalimantan .
Less exposed mineral processors and the general population in the mining areas were also intoxicated to a high percentage .
