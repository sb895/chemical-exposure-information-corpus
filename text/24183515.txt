Although traffic emits both air pollution and noise , studies jointly examining the effects of both of these exposures on blood pressure ( BP ) in children are scarce .
We investigated associations between land-use regression modeled long-term traffic-related air pollution and BP in 2368 children aged 10 years from Germany ( 1454 from Munich and 914 from Wesel ) .
We also studied this association with adjustment of long-term noise exposure ( defined as day-evening-night noise indicator " Lden " and night noise indicator " Lnight" ) in a subgroup of 605 children from Munich inner city .
In the overall analysis including 2368 children , NO2 , PM2.5 mass ( particles with aerodynamic diameters below 2.5\u03bcm ) , PM10 mass ( particles with aerodynamic diameters below 10\u03bcm ) and PM2.5 absorbance were not associated with BP .
When restricting the analysis to the subgroup of children with noise information ( N=605 ) , a significant association between NO2 and diastolic BP was observed ( -0.88 ( 95% confidence interval : -1.67 , -0.08) ) .
However , upon adjusting the models for noise exposure , only noise remained independently and significantly positively associated with diastolic BP .
Diastolic BP increased by 0.50 ( -0.03 , 1.02 ) , 0.59 ( 0.05 , 1.13 ) , 0.55 ( 0.03 , 1.07 ) , and 0.58 ( 0.05 , 1.11)mmHg for every five decibel increase in Lden and by 0.59 ( -0.05 , 1.22 ) , 0.69 ( 0.04 , 1.33 ) , 0.64 ( 0.02 , 1.27 ) , and 0.68 ( 0.05 , 1.32)mmHg for every five decibel increase in Lnight , in different models of NO2 , PM2.5 mass , PM10 mass and PM2.5 absorbance as the main exposure , respectively .
In conclusion , air pollution was not consistently associated with BP with adjustment for noise , noise was independently and positively associated with BP in children .
