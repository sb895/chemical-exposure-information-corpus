The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) has been associated with cigarette smoking .
The aim of our study was to assess the trace essential and toxic metals , cadmium ( Cd ) , lead ( Pb ) , and zinc ( Zn ) , in scalp hair samples of 32 Irish and 46 Pakistani smokers and non-smokers RA male patients with age range 42-56 years .
For comparison purpose , the scalp hair samples of 27 Irish and 55 Pakistani non-RA male subjects of the same age group were collected .
The concentrations of trace and toxic elements were measured by inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer and atomic absorption spectrophotometer prior to microwave-assisted acid digestion .
The validity and accuracy of the methodology was checked using certified reference materials and using conventional wet acid digestion method on the same certified reference materials ( CRMs ) .
The recovery of all studied elements was found to be in the range of 97.5-99.7% of certified reference values of CRMs .
The results of this study showed that the mean values of Cd and Pb were significantly higher in scalp hair samples of both smoker and non-smoker RA patients than in referents ( P < 0.001 ) , whereas the concentration of Zn was lower in the scalp hair samples of smokers and non-smokers rheumatoid arthritis patients .
The deficiency of Zn and the high exposure of Cd and Pb as a result of cigarette smoking may be synergistic risk factors associated with rheumatoid arthritis .
