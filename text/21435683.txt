In this study , for the first time , levels and accumulation profiles of eight currently available polybrominated/chlorinated biphenyl congeners ( PXBs ; XB-77 , -105 , -118 , -126A , -126B , -126C , -156 and -169 , named according to IUPAC nomenclature ) in human breast milk collected form Spanish women in 2005 were reported .
Concentrations and congener specific profiles of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , including co-planar PCBs , ( co-PCBs ) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) were also reported .
A concentration of 0.45 pg g(-1) lipid weight was found for total PXBs , and arithmetic mean concentrations of 125 , 25 and 5.5 ng g(-1) lipid weight were determined for total PCBs , co-PCBs and total PBDEs respectively .
Detectable levels of all congeners investigated , except CB-123 and XB-169 were found .
Levels of PCBs were similar to those found in Spanish samples collected after 2000 , and lower than those obtained before 2000 .
CB-138 , -153 and -180 were the predominant PCB congeners .
PBDE levels , dominated by BDE-47 , -99 , -100 and -209 , were lower than PCB levels .
PXB concentrations were the lowest , with XB-156 being the most abundant .
The concentration levels of PCBs and PBDEs found in this study were in the same range as those from other European countries .
Levels of PXBs were much lower than published values determined in Japan which were the only data found in the literature .
