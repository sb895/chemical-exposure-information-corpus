Health risk assessment due to the atmospheric emissions of carcinogenic pollutants ( PCDD/Fs and Cd ) from a waste gasification plant is performed by means of a probabilistic approach based on probability density functions for the description of the input data of the model parameters involved in the assessment .
These functions incorporate both the epistemic and stochastic uncertainty of the input data ( namely , the emission rate of the pollutants ) and of all the parameters used for individual exposure assessment through the pathways of inhalation , soil ingestion and dermal contact , and diet .
The uncertainty is propagated throughout the evaluation by Monte Carlo technique , resulting in the probability distribution of the individual risk .
The median risk levels nearby the plant are in the 10(-8)-10(-10) range , ten-fold lower than the deterministic estimate based on precautionary values for the input data ; however , the very upper percentiles ( >95th ) of the risk distribution can exceed the conventional 10(-6) reference value .
The estimated risk is almost entirely determined by the Cd exposure through the diet ; the pathways arising from PCDD/Fs exposure are without any practical significance , suggesting that the emission control should focus on Cd in order to reduce the carcinogenic risk .
Risk variance decomposition shows the prevailing influence on the estimated risk of the Cd concentration at the emission stack : thus , for a more accurate risk assessment the efforts should focus primarily on the definition of its probability density function .
