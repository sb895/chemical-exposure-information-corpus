The aim of the study was to determine the chromium concentrations of soil and plant specimens taken from a rural area exposed to cement factory emissions and also to determine the blood concentrations and sensitivity conditions observed in humans residing in this rural area .
The study was carried out in Cukurhisar , a town in Eskisehir-Turkey , between May 2000 and March 2001 .
Besides the 108 soil ( 36 for control ) and plant specimens , which were taken from eight different directions from the cement factory , blood samples of the individuals residing in this area were taken from 258 subjects ( 258 for control ) following a physical examination , and patch tests were also applied .
The chromium concentrations of the soil and plant specimens taken from different places in different directions of the factory were higher than in the control areas .
The physical examination of subjects did not reveal results different from those of the control group except for the diagnosis of contact dermatitis .
The analyses of venous blood samples showed that chromium concentrations were found to be within the reference values given for both groups , but higher in the subjects ( P<0.001 ) .
According to the results of patch tests , sensitivity to chromium was found to be more frequent for the subject group than the control group ( P<0.05 ) .
According to these results , clinical tools revealed no toxic effects for the subjects , except contact dermatitis .
However , sensitivity to patch tests showed that this subject group has been affected compared to the control group and that this effect increased with age .
