The Canadian House Dust Study was designed to obtain nationally representative urban house dust metal concentrations ( \u03bcg g(-1) ) and metal loadings ( \u03bcg m(-2) ) for arsenic ( As ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , chromium ( Cr ) , copper ( Cu ) , nickel ( Ni ) , lead ( Pb ) , and zinc ( Zn ) .
Consistent sampling of active dust of known age and provenance ( area sampled ) also permitted the calculation of indoor loading rates ( mg m(-2) day(-1) for dust and \u03bcg m(-2) day(-1) for metals ) for the winter season ( from 2007 to 2010 ) when houses are most tightly sealed .
Geomean/median indoor dust loading rates in homes located more than 2 km away from industry of any kind ( 9.6/9.1 mg m(-2) day(-1) ; n=580 ) were significantly lower ( p<.001 ) than geomean ( median ) dust loading rates in homes located within 2 km of industry ( 13.5/13.4 mg m(-2) day(-1) ; n=421 ) .
Proximity to industry was characterized by higher indoor metal loading rates ( p<.003 ) , but no difference in dust metal concentrations ( .29\u2265p\u2264.97 ) .
Comparisons of non-smokers ' and smokers ' homes in non-industrial zones showed higher metal loading rates ( .005\u2265p\u2264.038 ) in smokers ' homes , but no difference in dust metal concentrations ( .15\u2265p\u2264.97 ) .
Relationships between house age and dust metal concentrations were significant for Pb , Cd and Zn ( p<.001 ) but not for the other four metals ( .14\u2265p\u2264.87 ) .
All seven metals , however , displayed a significant increase in metal loading rates with house age ( p<.001 ) due to the influence of higher dust loading rates in older homes ( p<.001 ) .
Relationships between three measures of metals in house dust - concentration , load , and loading rate - in the context of house age , smoking behavior and urban setting consistently show that concentration data is a useful indicator of the presence of metal sources in the home , whereas dust mass is the overriding influence on metal loadings and loading rates .
