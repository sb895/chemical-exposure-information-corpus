The experience gained during the last 5 years in the study of 36 male workers exposed to hard metal dusts ( 10 engaged in mixing , 12 in presintering , three in sintering and 11 in grinding ) is presented .
The mean age was 33.2 years ( S.D. , 11.8 ) and the mean number of years of exposure was 9.4 ( S.D. , 7.6 ) .
All subjects received a physical examination , chest X-rays , pulmonary function test ( VC , FEV1 , expiratory flows , RV , DLCO , and metacholine bronchial provocation test ) , skin tests , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) and determination of trace metals in BAL , blood , urine , pubic hair and toe nails .
Two cases of bronchial asthma , six cases of interstitial lung disease and one case with both disorders were identified ; eight of these cases presented at BAL signs of alveolitis with different cytologic features .
Among the other 27 asymptomatic subjects , two showed an aspecific bronchial hyperreactivity , four showed a reduced DLCO , 12 showed an inverted ratio of CD4/CD8 lymphocytes in BAL without signs of alveolitis while one subject presented both an aspecific bronchial reactivity and a reduced DLCO .
The presence of aspecific bronchial hyperreactivity in asymptomatic subjects might represent a preclinical indicator of a possible evolution towards bronchial asthma .
An altered DLCO , alone or associated with an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio of BAL lymphocytes , might constitute an early sign of a possible evolution towards interstitial lung disease .
The association of aspecific bronchial reactivity and reduced DLCO might indicate the possible evolution towards a mixed form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
