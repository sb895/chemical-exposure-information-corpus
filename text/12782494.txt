An increasing incidence of testicular cancer has been reported from several countries in the Western world during the last decades .
According to current hypothesis , testicular cancer is initiated during the fetal period , and exposure to endocrine disruptors , i.e. , xenoestrogens , has been of concern .
In this investigation we studied the concentrations of the sum of 38 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , and chlordanes , in 61 cases with testicular cancer and 58 age-matched controls .
Furthermore , case and control mothers were also asked to participate , and 44 case mothers and 45 control mothers agreed .
They were of similar age .
In cases only the concentration on lipid basis of cis-nonachlordane was significantly increased , whereas case mothers showed significantly increased concentrations of the sum of PCBs , HCB , trans- and cis-nonachlordane , and the sum of chlordanes .
Among case mothers the sum of PCBs yielded an odds ratio ( OR ) of 3.8 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.4-10 was calculated using the median concentration for the control mothers as cutoff value .
For HCB , OR = 4.4 ( 95% CI , 1.7-12 ) ; for trans-nonachlordane , OR = 4.1 ( 95% CI , 1.5-11 ) ; for cis-nonachlordane , OR = 3.1 ( 95% CI , 1.2-7.8 ) ; and for sum of chlordanes , OR = 1.9 ( 95% CI , 0.7-5.0 ) .
No consistent different risk pattern was found for seminoma or nonseminoma testicular cancer .
