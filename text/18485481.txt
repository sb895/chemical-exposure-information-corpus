Volcanoes produce and release large amounts of toxicants , and the concentration of metals in hair can be used as a biomarker of exposure to trace metals .
In order to investigate whether humans exposed to volcanic emissions demonstrate higher concentrations of essential and non-essential trace metals , scalp hair of men ( 3-89 years ) living in two areas of the Azores , one exposed to volcanic emissions and the other not , was sampled , and their content in Cd , Cu , Pb , Rb , Se , and Zn was quantified by using High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry .
In average , men exposed to volcanic emissions presented higher concentrations of Cd ( 96.9 ppb ) , Cu ( 16.2 ppm ) , Pb ( 3417.6 ppb ) , Rb ( 216.3 ppb ) , and Zn ( 242.8 ppm ) , but not Se ( 469.6 ppb ) .
Also , strong and significant correlations were found between Cd-Rb and Pb-Rb in the exposed men .
In conclusion , humans living chronically exposed to volcanic emissions show high concentrations of essential and non-essential trace metals in scalp hair , and is suggested that this type of exposure may be as harmful as living close to industrial facilities .
