During June-August 2004 , blood lead ( BPb ) levels and various hematological parameters were evaluated in children aged 5-9 years old at ten primary schools located in eight neighborhoods in Cartagena , Colombia .
The schools selected for this study are attended mainly by children from families of low income .
A total of 189 subjects participated in the survey .
The arithmetic mean+/-standard error BPb level was 5.49+/-0.23 microg/dL ( range<1.0-21.0 microg/dL ) .
The geometric mean was 4.74 microg/dL ( 95% CI : 4.29-5.18 ) .
A proportion of the children ( 7.4% ) had BPb levels above the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's threshold of concern ( 10 microg Pb/dL ) .
BPb levels were correlated weakly , but significantly and positively , with red blood cell count ( RBC ) , and negatively with child body size , age , mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) , and mean corpuscular hemoglobin ( MCH ) .
BPb levels did not differ significantly between boys and girls but significant differences were observed between neighborhoods ( P<0.001 ) .
Activities such as metal melting-related processes and fishing net sinker production are the main sources of Pb exposure in Cartagena .
