Incremental lifetime health risks due to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/F ) emitted from municipal waste incineration ( MSWI ) facilities were evaluated for resident population in the area of the plant .
Risk assessment was performed through a multipathway combined probabilistic/deterministic approach for analyzing the effects of uncertainty and intrinsic variability of the main PCDD/F emission related parameters on final predicted values .
Exposure through direct inhalation of contaminated air , soil ingestion , soil dermal contact and diet were considered , with the propagation of the variability of input parameters throughout the evaluation performed with Monte Carlo simulation techniques .
The application to a case study representative of two different technological scenarios ( modern facilities equipped with BAT - Best Available Technology - and older incinerators ) in a location site typical of Northern Italy situation results in median values of the maximum individual excess risk on the order of 10(-9) and 10(-7) for most recent and older plant configurations , respectively .
Corresponding ratios for the 90th and 10th percentile values are around 7 and 9 .
Individual risk estimates derived for the same scenarios from conventional deterministic approaches , where large conservative assumptions are normally adopted for compensating the lack of knowledge about uncertainty , are essentially comparable with maximum values resulting from the probabilistic approach , thus leading to situations with extreme and very low probabilities of occurrence .
PCDD/F health risks from MSWI emissions might thus result largely overestimated if real emission characteristics are not properly considered in the assessment procedure .
Sensitivity analysis for identifying the contribution of different input parameters on final predicted risk variance indicates , for the area considered in the simulation , a prevailing influence of PCDD/F stack concentration , with exposures arising from soil deposition phenomena substantially negligible : this latter result further points out the requirements for a very careful identification of base input data values for PCDD/F stack concentrations , at least for those situations where plants are located nearby urban areas .
