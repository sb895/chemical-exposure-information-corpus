Concerns about reproductive and developmental health risks of exposure to organophosphate ( OP ) pesticides , phthalates , and bisphenol A ( BPA ) among the general population are increasing .
Six dialkyl phosphate ( DAP ) metabolites , 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TCPy ) , BPA , and fourteen phthalate metabolites were measured in 10 pooled urine samples representing 110 pregnant women who participated in the Norwegian Mother and Child Birth Cohort ( MoBa ) study in 2004 .
Daily intakes were estimated from urinary data and compared with reference doses ( RfDs ) and daily tolerable intakes ( TDIs ) .
The MoBa women had a higher mean BPA concentration ( 4.50 microg/L ) than the pregnant women in the Generation R Study ( Generation R ) in the Netherlands and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) in the United States .
The mean concentration of total DAP metabolites ( 24.20 microg/L ) in MoBa women was higher than that in NHANES women but lower than that in Generation R women .
The diethyl phthalate metabolite mono-ethyl phthalate ( MEP ) was the dominant phthalate metabolite in all three studies , with the mean concentrations of greater than 300 microg/L .
The MoBa and Generation R women had higher mean concentrations of mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MnBP ) and mono-isobutyl phthalate ( MiBP ) than the NHANES women .
The estimated average daily intakes of BPA , chlorpyrifos/chlorpyrifos-methyl and phthalates in MoBa ( and the other two studies ) were below the RfDs and TDIs .
The higher levels of metabolites in the MoBa participants may have been from intake via pesticide residues in food ( organophosphates ) , consumption of canned food , especially fish/seafood ( BPA ) , and use of personal care products ( selected phthalates ) .
