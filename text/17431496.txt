BACKGROUND A concern persists that children's exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgams produces neurotoxicity .
OBJECTIVE Our goal was to compare the neuropsychological function of children , without prior exposure to dental amalgam , whose caries were repaired using either dental amalgam or mercury-free composite materials .
METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 534 6- to 10-year-old urban and rural children who were assessed yearly for 5 years using a battery of tests of intelligence , achievement , language , memory , learning , visual-spatial skills , verbal fluency , fine motor function , problem solving , attention , and executive function .
RESULTS Although the mean urinary mercury concentration was greater among children in the amalgam group than the composite group ( 0.9 vs. 0.6 microg/g creatinine ) , few significant differences were found between the test scores of children in the two groups .
The differences found were inconsistent in direction .
Analyses using two cumulative exposure indices--surface years of amalgam and urinary mercury concentration--produced similar results .
CONCLUSIONS Exposure to elemental mercury in amalgam at the levels experienced by the children who participated in the trial did not result in significant effects on neuropsychological function within the 5-year follow-up period .
