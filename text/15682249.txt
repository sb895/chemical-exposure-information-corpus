An in-depth study was carried out in Rajapur , an arsenic-affected village in West Bengal , India , to determine the degree of groundwater contamination with arsenic and the impact of this contamination on residents .
The flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry ( FI-HG-AAS ) method was used to measure arsenic concentrations in water and biological samples .
Dermatologists recorded the dermatological features of arsenicosis .
Out of a total of 336 hand-pumped tube-wells in Rajapur , 91% ( 307/336 ) contained arsenic at concentrations > 10 microg/l , and 63% ( 213/336 ) contained arsenic at > 50 microg/l .
The type of arsenic in groundwater , the variation in concentrations of arsenic as the depth of tube-wells changed , and the iron concentration in the wells were also measured .
Altogether 825 of 3500 residents were examined for skin lesions ; of these , 149 had lesions caused by exposure to arsenic .
Of the 420 biological samples collected and analysed , 92.6% ( 389 ) contained arsenic at concentrations that were above normal .
Thus many villagers might be subclinically affected .
Although five arsenic-filtering devices had been installed in Rajapur , it appears that villagers are still exposed to raised concentrations of arsenic in their drinking-water .
Detailed village-level studies of arsenic-affected areas in West Bengal are required in order to understand the magnitude of contamination and its effects on people .
Villagers are ill-informed about the dangers of drinking arsenic-contaminated water .
The contamination could be brought under control by increasing community awareness of the dangers and implementing proper watershed management techniques that involve local people .
