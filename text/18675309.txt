The concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) were determined in samples of foodstuffs widely consumed by the population of Catalonia , Spain .
All samples were randomly acquired in 12 cities of Catalonia between March and June of 2006 , and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry .
The dietary intake of total and carcinogenic PAHs was estimated for various age/gender groups of population .
In order to determine the temporal trend on the dietary exposure to PAHs , the current results were compared with those of a previous survey ( 2000 ) .
The highest individual PAH levels corresponded to phenanthrene ( 29.66 microg/kg ) , naphthalene ( 25.87 microg/kg ) and fluoroanthene ( 13.66 microg/kg ) , while the lowest levels were benzo[a]pyrene ( 1.28 microg/kg ) , benzo[k]fluoranthene ( 1.31 microg/kg ) and indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene ( 1.44 microg/kg ) .
According to food groups , the highest levels of total PAHs were detected in meat and meat products ( 25.56 microg/kg ) , oils and fats ( 23.48 microg/kg ) , and cereals ( 20.44 microg/kg ) .
For an average male adult ( 70-kg body weight ) , the current dietary intake of the sum of PAHs was higher ( 12.0 microg/day ) than that found in our 2000 survey ( 8.4 microg/day ) .
