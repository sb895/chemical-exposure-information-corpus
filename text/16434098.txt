INTRODUCTION A study was conducted as a result of concern about mercury absorption amongst residents of a peri-urban area in Cape Town , South Africa , in close proximity to waste disposal sites and an industrial area .
STUDY METHODS The study compared urine mercury concentrations in a random sample of adult residents and children in both the formal and informal housing settlements of the " exposure " area ( n = 90 ) and a control area ( n = 90 ) .
A short questionnaire elicited demographic , lifestyle and medical details and possible occupational , household and environmental mercury exposures .
RESULTS The two samples were comparable with respect to background and potential confounding variables .
The prevalence of urinary mercury levels>or=the WHO reference range in the exposure area was also higher than that in the control area ( 13% vs. 0% ) .
The median urinary mercury concentrations in both study areas were below the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) reference level of 5.0 microg/g creatinine .
The median level in the exposure area was slightly , but statistically significantly , higher than in the control area ( 1.1 vs. 0.25 microg/g creatinine ) , and the excess persisted after controlling for known possible mercury exposures .
CONCLUSIONS This is to our knowledge the first study of community inorganic mercury absorption in a developing country setting , and where airborne mercury was the exposure of concern .
It was concluded that the health risk associated with the urinary mercury levels of residents in the exposure area was very low .
However , low level environmental exposure in the area of concern could not be excluded .
