OBJECTIVES The objectives of the present study were to assess the relative impact of different pathways of environmental cadmium ( Cd ) exposure and to evaluate the contribution from locally produced vegetables and root crops to the total dietary intake of Cd .
METHODS Cadmium in urine was determined for 492 individuals living near a closed down battery factory in Sweden .
For each individual we created an environmental exposure-index based on Cd emissions to ambient air and number of years living at various distances from the plant .
This information as well as dietary data were collected via questionnaires .
Samples of soil , carrots and/or potatoes were collected from 37 gardens and analysed for Cd concentration .
RESULTS Eating home grown vegetables/potatoes , environmental Cd-exposure-index , female gender , age above 30 years and smoking more than one pack of cigarettes daily for at least 10 years were found to be significantly associated with increased urine concentrations of Cd ( UCd>1.0 nmol/mmol creatinine ) .
We found a statistically significant relation between Cd in urine and environmental Cd-exposure-index in persons eating home grown vegetables/potatoes regularly .
Cd concentrations in home grown carrots , potatoes and in garden soil were highest in the area closest to the factory .
Daily consumption of potatoes and vegetables cultivated in the vicinity of the closed battery factory was estimated to increase Cd intake by 18-38% .
CONCLUSION The present study shows that consumption of locally grown vegetables and root crops was an important exposure pathway , in subjects living near a nickel-cadmium battery plant , whereas direct exposure via ambient air was less important .
