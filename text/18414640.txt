BACKGROUND The widespread use of organophosphorus ( OP ) pesticides has led to frequent exposure in adults and children .
Because such exposure may cause adverse health effects , particularly in children , the sources and patterns of exposure need to be studied further .
OBJECTIVES We assessed young urban/suburban children's longitudinal exposure to OP pesticides in the Children's Pesticide Exposure Study ( CPES ) conducted in the greater Seattle , Washington , area , and used a novel study design that allowed us to determine the contribution of dietary intake to the overall OP pesticide exposure .
METHODS Twenty-three children 3-11 years of age who consumed only conventional diets were recruited for this 1-year study conducted in 2003-2004 .
Children switched to organic diets for 5 consecutive days in the summer and fall sampling seasons .
We measured specific urinary metabolites for malathion , chlorpyrifos , and other OP pesticides in urine samples collected twice daily for a period of 7 , 12 , or 15 consecutive days during each of the four seasons .
RESULTS By substituting organic fresh fruits and vegetables for corresponding conventional food items , the median urinary metabolite concentrations were reduced to nondetected or close to non-detected levels for malathion and chlorpyrifos at the end of the 5-day organic diet intervention period in both summer and fall seasons .
We also observed a seasonal effect on the OP urinary metabolite concentrations , and this seasonality corresponds to the consumption of fresh produce throughout the year .
CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study demonstrate that dietary intake of OP pesticides represents the major source of exposure in young children .
