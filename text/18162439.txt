Perfluorinated compounds ( PFC ) are a large group of chemicals produced for several decades and widely used for many industrial and consumer applications .
Human Biomonitoring studies reveal a background exposure of the general population to perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and pefluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) in many parts of the world .
Reference values for PFOS and PFOA in the German population are currently not available .
However , the data of three PFC human biomonitoring studies are taken as basis for deriving a preliminary reference value .
The first two studies were performed in southern Germany with 105 ( sampling period 2003-2004 ) and 356 adults ( sampling period 2005 ) .
The third study was performed in North Rhine-Westphalia ( sampling period October and November 2006 ) in connection with the high PFOA contamination of drinking water in the Sauerland region .
Non PFOA exposed control groups comprised of 80 children and 153 females from Siegen and 103 men from Brilon .
The whole study which could be taken as a basis for PFOS reference considerations comprised of 170 children , 317 females and 204 men .
Though the studies are not representative for the German population , they provide at present the best available data basis for deriving reference values .
The 95th percentile values of the studies were used and the following preliminary reference values are recommended : PFOA , 10microg/l for all groups ; for PFOS 10microg/l for children at school beginner age , 15microg/l for adult females and 25microg/l for adult males .
