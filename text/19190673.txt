In 1980 , the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) determined there was sufficient evidence to support that inorganic arsenic was a human lung carcinogen based on studies involving exposure through inhalation .
In 2004 , IARC listed arsenic in drinking water as a cause of lung cancer , making arsenic the first substance established to cause human cancer through two unrelated pathways of exposure .
It may initially seem counterintuitive that arsenic in drinking water would cause human lung cancer , and even if it did , one might expect risks to be orders of magnitude lower than those from direct inhalation into the lungs .
In this paper , we consider lung cancer dose-response relationships for inhalation and ingestion of arsenic by focusing on two key studies , a cohort mortality study in the United States involving Tacoma smelter workers inhaling arsenic , and a lung cancer case-control study involving ingestion of arsenic in drinking water in northern Chile .
When exposure was assessed based on the absorbed dose identified by concentrations of arsenic in urine , there was very little difference in the dose-response findings for lung cancer relative risks between inhalation and ingestion .
The lung cancer mortality rate ratio estimate was 8.0 ( 95% CI 3.2-16.5 , P<0.001 ) for an average urine concentration of 1179 microg/l after inhalation , and the odds ratio estimate of the lung cancer incidence rate ratio was 7.1 ( 95% CI 3.4-14.8 , P<0.001 ) for an estimated average urine concentration of 825 microg/l following ingestion .
The slopes of the linear dose-response relationships between excess relative risk ( RR-1 ) for lung cancer and urinary arsenic concentration were similar for the two routes of exposure .
We conclude that lung cancer risks probably depend on absorbed dose , and not on whether inorganic arsenic is ingested or inhaled .
