Uptake of dioxins was confirmed in rice plants .
We determined ( i ) dioxin concentrations and isomer profiles in leaf+stem samples of rice plants grown in three soils with different dioxin concentrations and isomer profiles and ( ii ) temporal changes in dioxin concentrations and isomer profiles in rice grown in a paddy field on which agricultural chemicals containing dioxin impurities had been used in previous years .
Principal-component and chemical mass-balance analyses of the data showed that dioxin concentrations and isomer profiles in the rice grown in the different soils were similar , even though the dioxin concentrations and isomer profiles of the soils were different .
However , the dioxin concentrations in the rice were influenced by dioxin levels in the atmospheric gas phase .
Changes in dioxin levels during the growing period of the rice were also strongly influenced by adhesion of the soil to plant components during the early stage of growth , but gradually the influence of the atmospheric gas phase became predominant .
Calculated dietary uptake estimates indicated that , even in rice grown in Japan on soil contaminated with high concentrations of dioxins , the amount of dioxins ingested by humans from rice is extremely small , and the amount of dioxins ingested by livestock from forage rice is similar to that for other forage crops .
