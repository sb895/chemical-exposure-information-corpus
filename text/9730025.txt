Exposure during pregnancy to disinfection by-products in drinking water has been hypothesized to lead to several adverse reproductive outcomes .
We performed a retrospective cohort study to examine the relation of trihalomethane exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy to low birthweight , term low birthweight , and preterm delivery .
We matched Colorado birth certificates from January 1 , 1990 , through December 31 , 1993 , to historical water sample data with respect to time and location of maternal residence based on census block groups .
After excluding births from all census block groups with no trihalomethane sample data and restricting to singleton white births with 28-42 weeks of completed gestation ( >400 gm ) , we studied 1,893 livebirths within 28 census block groups .
We found a weak association of trihalomethane exposure during the third trimester with low birthweight ( odds ratio = 2.1 for the highest exposure level ; 95% confidence interval = 1.0-4.8 ) ; a large increase in risk for term low birthweight at the highest level of exposure ( odds ratio = 5.9 ; 95% confidence interval = 2.0-17.0 ) ; and no association between exposure and preterm delivery ( odds ratio = 1.0 for the highest exposure level ; 95% confidence interval = 0.3-2.8 ) .
The small number of adverse outcomes reduced the precision of risk estimates , but these data indicate a potentially important relation between third trimester exposure to trihalomethanes and retarded fetal growth .
