Urinary mercury levels and excretion rates were measured to determine the effect of dental amalgam restoration on the mercury body burden .
No consistent increase in urinary mercury concentrations was found among subjects who had a single restoration , but a continuously increasing statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) trend , that was 33% above background levels , was detected between 9 and 12 days after restoration , in the subject with four restorations in a single day .
The current findings suggested that even though amalgam restorations can cause an increase in mercury body burden , the elevation above background levels is small and thus the risks associated with the use of this material are considered minimal for the general population .
