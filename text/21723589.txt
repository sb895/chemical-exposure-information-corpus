INTRODUCTION We present data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( KNHANES ) 2008 on the associations between urinary arsenic and diabetes mellitus in a representative sample of the adult Korean population .
METHODS This study was based on data obtained in KNHANES 2008 , which was conducted for three years ( 2007-2009 ) using a rolling sampling design involving a complex , stratified , multistage , probability-cluster survey of a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of South Korea .
RESULTS Geometric means of total urinary arsenic concentration in females and total participants with diabetes mellitus were significantly higher than in participants without diabetes mellitus after adjustment for covariates , including age , seafood consumption , body mass index ( BMI ) , hypertension , area of residence , regional area , education level , and smoking and drinking status .
Multiple regression analysis after similar adjustment showed that total urinary arsenic concentration was associated with diabetes status in the females and total participants .
In addition , after similar adjustment , the odds ratios ( ORs ) for diabetes mellitus in female participants and all participants were 1.502 ( 95% CI , 1.038-2.171 ) and 1.312 ( 95% CI , 1.040-1.655 ) , respectively , for doubling of the level of urinary total arsenic concentration .
CONCLUSION This study showed an association between total urinary arsenic concentration and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in a representative sample of the adult population , especially women , with environmental arsenic exposure after adjustment for seafood intake and relevant diabetes risk factors .
