Mercury releases from gold mining occurred during the 1980s in the Upper Madeira river , a Southern tributary of the Amazon .
Downstream from these areas , riverside residents rely on fish consumption for subsistence .
In July of 1993 , hair samples were collected for mercury analysis from a group of mothers and their infants and one pregnant woman .
By assuming a constant rate of hair growth ( 1.1 cm per month ) , a temporal profile of the methylmercury exposure was determined for the previous 2 to 3 years .
The length of hair segments corresponded to hair growth during pregnancy and the subsequent breastfeeding periods .
During all periods , hair mercury concentrations in six mothers were in the range of 4.5-26.8 ppm , slightly lower than those of their infants ( 8.2-28.4 ppm ) .
Further segmental analyses of hair mercury from another six mothers showed concentrations in the range of 12.2-41.0 ppm during the three trimesters of pregnancy and 4.0-33.5 ppm during breast feeding-slightly lower than their infants ( 11.6-50.4 ppm ) .
Another four mothers showed hair mercury concentrations in the range of 21. 3-84.4 ppm .
