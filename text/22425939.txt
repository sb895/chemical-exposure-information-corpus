Methylmercury ( MeHg ) is a well-known neurotoxic agent , and consumption of contaminated fish is the principal environmental source of MeHg exposure in humans .
Children are more susceptible to adverse effects than adults .
No previous specific data exist for intake by Finnish children of methylmercury from fish .
We estimated fish consumption and MeHg intakes from species most commonly consumed by Finnish children aged 1-6 years .
The total mercury concentrations were determined in fish species consumed , and age-specific methylmercury intakes were derived .
We also examined safety margins and the proportion of children exceeding the tolerable daily intakes set by international expert bodies .
The daily intake of MeHg ranged from 0 to 0.33 \u03bcg/kg bw .
The strictest reference value 0.1 \u03bcg/kg bw/day for MeHg , proposed by USEPA , was exceeded by 1-15% of the study population , and FAO/WHO JECFA provisional tolerable weekly intake of 1.6 \u03bcg/kg bw was exceeded by 1% of boys and 2.5% of girls aged 6 years .
Intakes of 1-year old girls were higher than of boys , whereas for 3-year olds they were the opposite .
The highest intakes were observed for 6-year-old boys and girls .
There was great variation in the estimated MeHg intakes among Finnish children .
