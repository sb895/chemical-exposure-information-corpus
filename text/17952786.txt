Since 1990 , a large number of people have been experiencing various health problems from drinking arsenic contaminated water ( 50-1860 microg/L ) in 13 counties of Inner Mongolia , China , most of which are located in the Hetao Plain area .
It is calculated that 411,243 people are currently at risk from arsenic poisoning .
Clinical and epidemiological investigations were carried out on 13,021 people to ascertain the nature and degree of morbidity that occurred due to chronic arsenic toxicity .
In all of the studied patients , 22% had typical hyperkeratosis on the palms or soles and some had raindrop-like hyperpigmentation and depigmentation on the trunk .
Other data recorded included subjective and objective symptoms , such as chronic cough ( 35.0% ) and insomnia ( 37.5% ) .
During physical checkups of 680 villagers in arsenic affected areas , liver function tests showed elevated globulin levels in 6.8% ( P value=0.006 ) of the subjects .
Neurotoxicity manifesting as loss of hearing 5.88 ( P value=0.005 ) , loss of taste 5.44% ( P value=0.001 ) , blurred vision 17.35% ( P value=0.000 ) , tingling and numbness of the limbs 33.53% ( P value=0.000 ) and hypertension 8.09% ( P value=0.000 ) were significantly higher in the arsenic affected villages and arsenic pollution also seemed to affect patients ' social life and mental health .
To solve the problem of arsenic exposure , the quality of drinking water needs to be improved by reducing the arsenic content .
We also plan to carry out a survey to detect the incidence and types of cancer among this population .
