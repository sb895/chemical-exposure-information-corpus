High concentration of mercury ( Hg ) in hair has been reported for Cambodians .
To confirm the Hg contamination occurring through intake , Hg concentrations were determined in both hair and blood of residents ( n=20 ) from Phnom Penh , Cambodia .
Mercury concentrations in the hair and blood were 0.69-190microg g(-1) dry wt and 5.2-58microg l(-1) , respectively , which were lower than those from Hg contaminated or high fish intake regions , but were higher than those from non-contaminated regions .
Some female subjects had hair and blood Hg levels exceeding the threshold values for neurotoxic effects .
Interestingly , serum estrone and estradiol levels were positively correlated with blood Hg level for both males and females , indicating possible induction of female hormones by Hg exposure in Cambodians .
