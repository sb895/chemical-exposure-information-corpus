A cross sectional study was carried out to evaluate arsenic exposure of residents living in an area with a soil naturally rich in arsenic ( As ) , through urinary measurements .
During the summer of 2007 , 322 people aged over 7 years and resident in the study area for at least 4 days prior to the investigation were recruited .
The sum of urinary inorganic arsenic and metabolites ( iAs+MMA+DMA ) and speciation were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry , respectively .
Geometric means levels of iAs+MMA+DMA were 3.6 microg/L or 4.4 microg/g creatinine .
The percent of DMA , As(III) and MMA contribution to urinary arsenic concentrations was respectively 84.2% , 12% and 3.7% .
We found significant associations between urinary arsenic concentrations and the consumption of seafood ( p=0.03 ) , the consumption of wine ( p=0.03 ) and beer ( p=0.001 ) , respectively 3 and 4 days before the investigation .
When we focus on the various species , As(V) was rarely detected and DMA is the predominant metabolite composing the majority of measurable inorganic-related As in the urine .
Considering the percent of DMA contribution to iAs+MMA+DMA urinary concentrations , almost half of the subjects had 100% of DMA contribution whatever the concentration of urinary As whereas the others had a lower DMA contribution , between 39 and 90% .
Arsenic levels reported in this original study in France were between 2 and 4 times lower than in other studies dealing with iAs+MMA+DMA levels associated with soil arsenic exposure .
Arsenic levels were similar to those observed in unexposed individuals in European countries , although 10% were above the French guideline values for the general population .
