Possible human health effects of phthalate plasticizers have been intensely discussed during the last decade .
Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) , the phthalate acid ester with the largest production volume worldwide , has been substituted by new compounds like Diisononyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ( DINCH ) or Di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate ( DEHT ) in many applications .
There are numerous reports about concentration levels of phthalates in indoor environments , but data on concentrations of these alternative plasticizers are not available yet .
Also , the methods for the determination of phthalate substitutes are not yet established .
This study presents the results achieved by quantification using different analytical methods .
Data on the concentration of DEHT and DINCH in 953 dust samples from German households are presented .
These samples were obtained in four different studies conducted from 1997 to 2009 .
Maximum concentrations of 110 mg DINCH/kg dust and 440 mg DEHT/kg dust were found .
Especially the amount of DINCH has increased significantly after the market introduction of this plasticizer in 2002 .
Up to the beginning of 2006 , DINCH was found in 44% of the dust samples .
Dust samples collected in 2009 indicate an increased concentration for both softeners .
