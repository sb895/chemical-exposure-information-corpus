This article presents an integrated , biologically based , source-to-dose assessment framework for modeling multimedia/multipathway/multiroute exposures to arsenic .
Case studies demonstrating this framework are presented for three US counties ( Hunderton County , NJ ; Pima County , AZ ; and Franklin County , OH ) , representing substantially different conditions of exposure .
The approach taken utilizes the Modeling ENvironment for TOtal Risk studies ( MENTOR ) in an implementation that incorporates and extends the approach pioneered by Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation ( SHEDS ) , in conjunction with a number of available databases , including NATA , NHEXAS , CSFII , and CHAD , and extends modeling techniques that have been developed in recent years .
Model results indicate that , in most cases , the food intake pathway is the dominant contributor to total exposure and dose to arsenic .
Model predictions are evaluated qualitatively by comparing distributions of predicted total arsenic amounts in urine with those derived using biomarker measurements from the NHEXAS--Region V study : the population distributions of urinary total arsenic levels calculated through MENTOR and from the NHEXAS measurements are in general qualitative agreement .
Observed differences are due to various factors , such as interindividual variation in arsenic metabolism in humans , that are not fully accounted for in the current model implementation but can be incorporated in the future , in the open framework of MENTOR .
The present study demonstrates that integrated source-to-dose modeling for arsenic can not only provide estimates of the relative contributions of multipathway exposure routes to the total exposure estimates , but can also estimate internal target tissue doses for speciated organic and inorganic arsenic , which can eventually be used to improve evaluation of health risks associated with exposures to arsenic from multiple sources , routes , and pathways .
