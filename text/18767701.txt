To learn the extent of human exposure to polyfluoroalkyl compounds ( PFCs ) in a remote fishing population , we measured , in Faroese children and pregnant women , the serum concentrations of nine PFCs , including perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) , perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , and perfluorononanoate ( PFNA ) , by using online solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry .
The serum samples analyzed had been collected between 1993 and 2005 from 103 children 7 years of age , 79 of these children at 14 years of age , and from 12 pregnant women and their children 5 years later .
PFOS was detected in all samples analyzed , and both PFOA and PFNA were detected in all but one of the samples .
The concentrations found are comparable tothose reported elsewhere .
Correlations between paired concentrations were poor .
However , PFOS and PFNA concentrations correlated well with the frequency of pilotwhale dinners and with concentrations of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls .
One whale meal every two weeks increased the PFOS concentration in 14-year-olds by about 25% and PFNA by 50% .
The high frequency of detection of most PFCs suggests widespread exposure in the Faroe Islands already by the early 1990s , with whale meat being an important source .
