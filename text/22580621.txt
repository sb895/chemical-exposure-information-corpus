Drinking of arsenic ( As)-contaminated groundwater has adverse effects on health of millions of people worldwide .
This study aimed to determine the degree of severity of As exposure from drinking water in peri-urban Moyna and Ardebok villages , West Bengal , India .
Arsenic concentrations in hair , nail and urine samp les of the individuals were determined .
Arsenical dermatosis , keratosis and melanosis were investigated through medical evaluation .
We have evaluated the association between As exposure from drinking water , and keratosis and melanosis outcomes .
The results showed that 82.7% of the sampled tube wells contain As concentrations above 10\u03bcg/L , while 57.7% contain As concentrations above 50\u03bcg/L .
The hair , nail and urine As concentrations were positively correlated with As concentrations in drinking water .
In our study population , we observed a strong association between As concentrations ranging 51-99\u03bcg/L and keratosis and melanosis outcomes , although the probability decreases at higher concentration ranges perhaps due to switching away from the use of As-contaminated tube wells for drinking and cooking purposes .
High As concentrations in hair , nail and urine were observed to be associated with the age of the study population .
The level of As concentrations in hair , nail and urine samples of the study population indicated the degree of severity of As exposure in the study region .
