A variety of environmentally persistent contaminants of the Great Lakes Basin are able to bioaccumulate in the aquatic food chain and pose a threat to the health and reproductive success of people and wildlife that depend on locally caught fish as a source of dietary protein .
Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene ( DDE ) has been linked to higher rates of cancer , reproductive problems , and endocrine disorders .
To investigate the effects of exposure to persistent contaminants of the Great Lakes Basin , the health departments of five Great Lakes states formed a health-assessment consortium .
Between 1988 and 1994 , the consortium collected demographic and fish consumption information from 2548 licensed charter boat captains , 182 anglers , and 1667 referents .
Between 1994 and 1995 , a subset of 619 participants in this study provided additional fish consumption information and donated blood samples that were analyzed for PCBs and DDE .
Follow-up studies conducted between 2001 and 2005 re-assessed fish consumption rates and blood levels of PCBs and DDE in 293 of these individuals .
While there was a trend for increasing overall fish consumption among most participant groups , sportfish and Great Lakes sportfish consumption decreased significantly in the captains over the study period .
Serum DDE concentrations , which were highest in men in the captain and angler groups , declined in 90% of study participants .
Mean DDE levels fell from 5.6 to 3.2 microg/L .
Total PCB levels declined in 80% of participants with the mean concentration falling from 4.2 to 2.8 microg/L .
Annual declines in serum DDE and PCB concentrations averaged 4.6% and 3.5% , respectively .
