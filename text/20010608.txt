The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between trace and toxic elements zinc ( Zn ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , nickel ( Ni ) and lead ( Pb ) in biological samples ( scalp hair , blood and urine ) of smoker and nonsmoker hypertensive patients ( n=457 ) , residents of Hyderabad , Pakistan .
For the purpose of comparison , the biological samples of age-matched healthy controls were selected as referents .
The concentrations of trace and toxic elements were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer prior to microwave-assisted acid digestion .
The validity and accuracy of the methodology were checked using certified reference materials and by the conventional wet acid digestion method on the same certified reference materials and real samples .
The recovery of all the studied elements was found to be in the range of 97.8-99.3% in certified reference materials .
The results of this study showed that the mean values of Cd , Ni and Pb were significantly higher in scalp hair , blood and urine samples of both smoker and nonsmoker patients than in referents ( P<0.001 ) , whereas the concentration of Zn was lower in the scalp hair and blood , but higher in the urine samples of hypertensive patients .
The deficiency of Zn and the high exposure of toxic metals as a result of tobacco smoking may be synergistic with risk factors associated with hypertension .
