This study aimed to provide first data on the concentrations of different classes of organohalogenated contaminants ( OHCs ) in human serum from Pakistan , an area with limited information on environmental pollution .
Serum samples ( N=85 ) were collected from mothers ( N=34 ; age ranged 23-51 years ) , their children ( N=34 ; age 3-10 years ) and general group ( N=17 ; age 13-65 years ) with rural and urban residential settings .
The concentrations of studied OHCs in serum decreased as follows : organochlorinated pesticides ( OCPs)>polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs)>polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) .
Novel brominated flame retardants ( NBFRs ) were not detected , except for 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)-ethane ( BTBPE)<0.2-8 ng/g lipid weight ( lw ) .
Low levels of HO-PCBs ( <0.2-20 ng/g lw ) were detected , while HO-PBDEs were <0.2 ng/g lw. \u2211PCBs ( 2-105 ng/g lw ) together with \u2211PBDEs ( 0.2-6.7 ng/g lw ) contributed of the total OHCs body burden .
The concentration(s) of major contributors ( >80% ) of OCPs ranged from <1-3645 ng/g lw for 1,1'-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene ( p,p'-DDE ) , <1-445 ng/g lw for \u03b2-hexachlorocyclohexane ( \u03b2-HCH ) and from 5 to 200 ng/g lw for pentachlorophenol ( PCP). p,p'-DDE , the major OHC , was significantly higher ( p<0.05 ) in rural children than in all other groups .
In serum of rural children , the major OHCs were significantly higher ( p<0.05 ) than the mothers .
The current study indicates continuous exposure to humans with already regulated OHCs and highlights the need for further monitoring of these OHCs in the region .
