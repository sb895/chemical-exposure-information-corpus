Human reproductive endocrine data may be an important source of epidemiologic information in regard to the toxic potential of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( dioxin ) .
The association of serum dioxin with total serum testosterone , luteinizing hormone , and follicle-stimulating hormone was examined in 248 chemical production workers from New Jersey and Missouri plants and 231 nonexposed neighborhood referents who participated in a medical evaluation in 1987 .
In linear regression analyses , current serum dioxin was positively and significantly related to luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and inversely related to total testosterone after adjustment for potential confounders ( p < 0.05 ) .
These trends were also apparent in logistic regression analyses , in which the authors examined the odds ratios of high luteinizing hormone ( > 28 IU/liter ) , high follicle-stimulating hormone ( > 31 IU/liter ) , and low testosterone ( < 10.4 nmol/liter ) by serum dioxin quartiles .
There was a greater prevalence of high luteinizing hormone among workers in the second ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.9 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 0.7-5.5 ) , third ( OR = 2.5 , 95% CI 0.9-7.3 ) , and fourth ( OR = 1.9 , 95% CI 0.7-5.0 ) quartiles of serum dioxin compared with referents .
For follicle-stimulating hormone , the authors observed a greater prevalence of high follicle-stimulating hormone among workers in the fourth quartile ( OR = 2.0 , 95% CI 0.7-5.6 ) compared with referents .
Similarly , the prevalence of low testosterone was two to four times greater among workers in the second ( OR = 3.9 , 95% CI 1.3-11.3 ) , third ( OR = 2.7 , 95% CI 0.9-8.2 ) , and fourth quartiles ( OR = 2.1 , 95% CI 0.8-5.8 ) than among referents .
The trends observed in these data offer human evidence of alterations in male reproductive hormone levels associated with dioxin exposure .
The results support the animal literature in which dioxin-related effects have been observed on the hypothalamic-pituitary-Leydig-cell axis and on testosterone synthesis .
