BACKGROUND Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are ubiquitous air pollutants generated by combustion of organic material , including fossil fuel .
OBJECTIVES It has been an open question whether prenatal exposure to air pollution in general and PAHs in particular significantly increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction , including small size for gestational age ( SGA ) , and preterm delivery .
Here , we have examined this hypothesis in a cohort of mothers and newborns in New York City .
METHODS Subjects were young , nonsmoking , healthy African-American ( n = 224 ) and Dominican ( n = 392 ) mother-newborn pairs residing in New York City whose prenatal PAH exposures were estimated by personal air monitoring .
Questionnaire and medical record data were obtained .
RESULTS A 1 natural-log ( ln)-unit increase in prenatal PAH exposure was associated with a 2-fold increase in risk of symmetric intrauterine growth restriction ( i.e. , SGA and fetal growth ratio < 85% ) among full-term African Americans ( p < 0.05 ) .
Preterm delivery risk was 5-fold greater among African Americans per ln-unit increase in prenatal PAH exposure .
The same unit increase in exposure significantly increased the ratio of head circumference to birth weight by 0.04% in African Americans .
These effects were not observed in Dominicans .
CONCLUSION Prenatal PAH exposure is likely to contribute to the occurrence of SGA as well as preterm births among African Americans .
The lack of an association in Dominicans might reflect modification of the risk by healthful cultural practices among recent Dominican immigrants .
Given that PAHs are globally generated and distributed pollutants , our observations have potential implications for environmental health and energy policies .
