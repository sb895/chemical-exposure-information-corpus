Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) is a major risk to human health , and the home is the greatest single source of ETS for children .
The authors investigated fetal exposure to paternal smoking at home during pregnancy .
Korean families were included as trios of fathers , mothers , and neonates identified in 2005-2007 .
Sixty-three trios were finally enrolled in this study after exclusion of those in which the mother was a smoker or was regularly exposed to ETS at places other than the home .
Nicotine and cotinine concentrations in hair were measured by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine long-term exposure to ETS .
The difference between neonatal nicotine concentrations in the smoker and nonsmoker groups was not statistically significant .
However , in the indoor-smoker group , neonatal nicotine concentrations were significantly higher than in the outdoor and nonsmoker groups ( P < 0.05 ) .
Furthermore , neonatal nicotine concentrations in the outdoor-smoker group were not different from those in the nonsmoker group .
These findings indicate that paternal smoking inside the home leads to significant fetal and maternal exposure to ETS and may subsequently affect fetal health .
Conversely , findings show that paternal smoking outside the home prevents the mother and her fetus from being exposed to ETS .
