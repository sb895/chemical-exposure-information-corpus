The dietary intake of polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE ) of local residents from 2 major electronic waste ( e-waste ) processing sites ( Guiyu , Guangdong Province and Taizhou , Zhejiang Province ) in China was investigated .
Seventy-four food items were collected from these sites , divided into 9 food groups ( freshwater fish , marine fish , shellfish , pork , poultry , chicken offal , egg , vegetables and cereals ) , and examined for residual PBDE concentrations .
Out of all food items examined , the freshwater bighead carp ( Aristichthys nobilis ) contained extremely high ( 11,400±254 ng/g wet wt. ) concentrations of PBDE , the highest concentrations amongst published data concerning PBDE detected in freshwater fish .
Food consumption data obtained through semi-quantitative food intake questionnaires showed that Guiyu residents had a PBDE dietary intake of 931±772 ng/kg bw/day , of which BDE-47 ( 584 ng/kg bw/day ) exceeded the US EPA's reference dose ( 100 ng/kg/day ) .
Taizhou ( 44.7±26.3 ng/kg bw/day ) and Lin'an ( 1.94±0.86 ng/kg bw/day ) residents exhibited lower readings .
The main dietary source of PBDEs in Guiyu and Taizhou residents was seafood ( 88-98% ) and pork ( 41% ) in Lin'an .
The present results indicated that health risks arising from PBDE dietary exposure are of significance in terms of public health and food safety to local residents of e-waste processing sites .
