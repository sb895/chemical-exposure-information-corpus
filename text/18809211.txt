The characteristics of arsenic-contaminated groundwater and the potential risks from the groundwater were investigated .
Arsenic contamination in groundwater was found in four villages ( Vinh Tru , Bo De , Hoa Hau , Nhan Dao ) in Ha Nam province in northern Vietnam .
Since the groundwater had been used as one of the main drinking water sources in these regions , groundwater and hair samples were collected in the villages .
The concentrations of arsenic in the three villages ( Vinh Tru , Bo De , Hoa Hau ) significantly exceeded the Vietnamese drinking water standard for arsenic ( 10 microg/L ) with average concentrations of 348 , 211 , and 325 microg/L , respectively .
According to the results of the arsenic speciation testing , the predominant arsenic species in the groundwater existed as arsenite [ As(III) ] .
Elevated concentrations of iron , manganese , and ammonium were also found in the groundwater .
Although more than 90% of the arsenic was removed by sand filtration systems used in this region , arsenic concentrations of most treated groundwater were still higher than the drinking water standard .
A significant positive correlation was found between the arsenic concentrations in the treated groundwater and in female human hair .
The risk assessment for arsenic through drinking water pathways shows both potential chronic and carcinogenic risks to the local community .
More than 40% of the people consuming treated groundwater are at chronic risk for arsenic exposure .
