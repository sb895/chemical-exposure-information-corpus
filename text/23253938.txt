Perchlorate is an iodine-uptake inhibitor and common contaminant of food and drinking water .
Understanding the amount of perchlorate exposure occurring through non-water sources is essential for accurate estimates of human exposure levels , and establishment of drinking water limits for this pervasive contaminant .
The study objective was to determine the amount of perchlorate intake derived from diet rather than water .
Subjects provided drinking water samples , detailed fluid-intake records , 24h urine collections and four milk samples for nine days .
Samples were analyzed for perchlorate by isotope dilution ion chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry .
Amounts of perchlorate derived from drinking water and dietary sources were calculated for each individual .
Water of local origin was found to contribute a minor fraction of perchlorate intake .
Estimated fraction intake from drinking water ranged from 0 to 36% .
The mean and median dose of perchlorate derived from non-water sources by lactating women was 0.18 \u03bcg/kg/day ( range : 0.06 to 0.36 \u03bcg/kg/day. )
Lactating women consumed more fluid ( mean 2.424 L/day ) than has been assumed in recent risk assessments for perchlorate .
The data reported here indicate that lactating women may be exposed to perchlorate through dietary sources at markedly higher levels than estimated previously .
Exposures to perchlorate from non-water sources may be higher than recent estimates , including those used to develop drinking water standards .
