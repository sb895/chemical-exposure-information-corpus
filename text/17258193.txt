The potential exposures of 127 preschool children to the pyrethroid insecticides , cis- and trans-permethrin , in their everyday environments were examined .
Participants were recruited randomly from 127 homes and 16 daycare centers in six Ohio ( OH ) counties .
Monitoring was performed over a 48-h period at the children's homes and/or daycare centers .
Samples collected included soil , carpet dust , indoor air , outdoor air , diet , hand wipes , surface wipes , transferable residues , and urine .
The environmental samples were analyzed for the cis and trans isomers of permethrin , and the urine samples were analyzed for the pyrethroid urinary metabolite , 3-phenoxybenzoic acid ( 3-PBA ) , by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry .
The isomers were detected most often in the dust ( 100% ) and hand wipe ( >78% ) samples collected at both homes and daycare centers .
The median levels of cis-permethrin ( 470 and 1010 ng/g ) were higher than the median levels of trans-permethrin ( 344 and 544 ng/g ) in the dust samples at both the children's homes and daycare centers , respectively .
In the children's hand wipe samples , the median levels of cis- and trans-permethrin were similar , ranging from 0.03 to 0.04 ng/cm(2) , at both locations .
The urinary metabolite 3-PBA was detected in 67% of the children's urine samples .
The median urinary 3-PBA concentration for the children was 0.3 ng/mL , and the maximum value for one child was 33.8 ng/mL .
The primary route of the children's exposure to the combined isomers was through dietary ingestion , followed by indirect ingestion .
In addition , our calculated aggregate absorbed doses of permethrin accounted for about 60% of the excreted amounts of 3-PBA found in the children's urine .
In conclusion , these children were potentially exposed to low levels of permethrin from several sources , and through several pathways and routes .
