Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are still the most abundant pollutants in wildlife and humans .
Hydroxylated PCB metabolites ( OH-PCBs ) are known to be formed in humans and wildlife .
Studies in animals show that these metabolites cause endocrine-related toxicity .
The health effects in humans have not yet been evaluated , especially the effect on the fetus and newborn .
The aim of this study is to measure the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in maternal and cord blood samples in a population with background levels of PCBs .
We analyzed 51 maternal and corresponding cord blood samples in the northern part of the Netherlands .
The PCB concentrations in maternal plasma ranged from 2 to 293 ng/g lipid , and OH-PCB concentrations from nondetectable ( ND ) to 0.62 ng/g fresh weight .
In cord plasma , PCB concentrations were 1-277 ng/g lipid , and OH-PCB concentrations , ND to 0.47 ng/g fresh weight .
The cord versus maternal blood calculated ratio was 1.28 +/- 0.56 for PCBs and 2.11 +/- 1.33 for OH-PCBs , expressed per gram of lipid .
When expressed per gram fresh weight , the ratios are 0.32 +/- 0.15 and 0.53 +/- 0.23 for PCBs and OH-PCBs , respectively .
A significant correlation between the respective maternal and cord levels for both PCBs and OH-PCBs was found .
Our results indicate that OH-PCBs and PCBs are transferred across the placenta to the fetus in concentrations resulting in levels of approximately 50 and 30% , respectively , of those in maternal plasma .
More research in humans is needed to evaluate potential negative effects of these endocrine disruptors on the fetus .
