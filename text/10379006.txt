In widespread informal gold mining in the Amazon Basin , mercury is used to capture the gold particles as amalgam .
Releases of mercury to the environment have resulted in the contamination of freshwater fish with methylmercury .
In four comparable Amazonian communities , we examined 351 of 420 eligible children between 7 and 12 years of age .
In three Tapaj√≥s villages with the highest exposures , more than 80% of 246 children had hair-mercury concentrations above 10 microg/g , a limit above which adverse effects on brain development are likely to occur .
Neuropsychological tests of motor function , attention , and visuospatial performance showed decrements associated with the hair-mercury concentrations .
Especially on the Santa Ana form board and the Stanford-Binet copying tests , similar associations were also apparent in the 105 children from the village with the lowest exposures , where all but two children had hair-mercury concentrations below 10 microg/g .
Although average exposure levels may not have changed during recent years , prenatal exposure levels are unknown , and exact dose relationships cannot be generated from this cross-sectional study .
However , the current mercury pollution seems sufficiently severe to cause adverse effects on brain development .
