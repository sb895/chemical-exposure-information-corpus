Increased risk of ill-health and diseases has been associated with employment in the ferro-alloy factory .
Since measurement of transition metals in human blood and hair along with respective exposure rates , provides a means of assessing individual risk , it has been the most important part of the study .
In the study majority of the elements in the transition series , such as , vanadium ( V ) , chromium ( Cr ) , iron ( Fe ) , manganese ( Mn ) , cobalt , ( Co ) nickel ( Ni ) , copper ( Cu ) , zinc ( Zn ) , molybdenum ( Mo ) and cadmium ( Cd ) were considered which are randomly emitted from the source , that is , manganese ore ( used during ferro-alloy manufacturing process ) .
The commonly available transition , metals , observed in biological samples of ferro-alloy workers , were found to be Fe , Zn , Co , Ni , Cu , Cr , Cd , V Mn and Mo in blood , while in hair , Mn , Fe , Zn , Co , Ni , Cu , Cr , Cd , V and Mo were present in decreasing order Surveillance of bio-concentration of these metals in workers , exposed to close proximity of the coke-ovens and smelting furnaces , revealed that the workers were prone to several physical disorders .
