BACKGROUND In humans , persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) are stored primarily in adipose tissue .
Their total body burden and their contribution to obesity-associated diseases remain unclear .
OBJECTIVES We characterized POP total body burden and their redistribution in obese individuals before and after drastic weight loss and compared these values with a variety of molecular , biological , and clinical parameters .
METHODS Seventy-one obese subjects were enrolled and underwent bariatric surgery .
Blood and adipose tissue samples were obtained at different times from these individuals as well as from 18 lean women .
RESULTS POP content ( 17 dioxins/furans and 18 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners ) in different adipose tissue territories was similar , allowing us to assess total POP body burden from a single biopsy .
Total POP body burden was 2 to 3 times higher in obese than in lean individuals .
We also found increased expression of some POP target genes in obese adipose tissue .
Drastic weight loss led to increased serum POPs and , within 6-12 months , to a significant 15% decrease in total polychlorinated biphenyl body burden .
Importantly , serum POP levels were positively correlated with liver toxicity markers and lipid parameters , independently of age and body mass index .
CONCLUSIONS POP content in adipose tissue and serum correlate with biological markers of obesity-related dysfunctions .
Drastic weight loss leads to a redistribution of POPs and to a moderate decrease of their total body burden .
