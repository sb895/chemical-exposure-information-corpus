In the present study , non-ortho , mono-ortho and other ortho-substituted PCB congeners were analysed in individual blood serum samples taken from healthy adults ( 196 males and 119 females ) in the polluted area of the Michalovce district and in the background area of the Stropkov/Svidnik districts in Eastern Slovakia by high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry ( HRGC/HRMS ) .
The samples from general population living in villages and towns of two regions were taken between August 2001 and February 2002 within the project of the EC's 5th Framework Programme ( PCBRISK , ) .
The medians of dioxin-like PCBs ( dl-PCBs)--expressed as TEQs on lipid basis--of all males ( 24.7 pg g(-1) lipid ) and females ( 21.4 pg g(-1) lipid ) were comparable , but there was a significant difference between both of the areas studied .
In the district of Michalovce , the medians of males ( 47.3 pg g(-1) lipid ) and females ( 41.1 pg g(-1) lipid ) were 2.3 times higher than in the area of the Stropkov/Svidnik districts .
The medians of total non-dioxin-like PCB concentration were 1,835 and 1,033 ng g(-1) lipid in males and females , respectively .
The data show a trend toward higher concentrations of both dl- and non-dioxin-like PCBs in the older age groups .
The substantial increase was observed for the 60+ age group .
PCB-126 was the most abundant non-ortho congener .
PCBs-118 and 156 were the predominant mono-ortho congeners .
They were quantitated in all samples analysed .
Congeners 153 , 138(+163) , 180 and 170(+190) were the main contributors to total non-dioxin-like PCB concentrations .
Mean mutual ratio HexaCBs:HeptaCBs:OctaCBs in the non-dioxin-like group was 37:50:1 .
The results of this study represent the overall information about the congener distribution of dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like PCBs in human serum blood of adult Slovaks .
