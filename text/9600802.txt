The methylmercury exposure of patients with congenital or infantile Minamata disease is known only from a small number of analyses of umbilical cords .
Four laboratories in Japan have analyzed a total of 176 samples of umbilical cord tissue obtained from Minamata .
The highest concentrations were seen in cord tissue from children born during 1950-1965 , i.e. , the peak period of acetaldehyde production in Minamata before installation of waste water treatment .
Twenty-four samples from patients diagnosed with Minamata disease showed a median mercury concentration of 1.63 microg/g and differed significantly from levels seen in cord tissue from control children .
However , children diagnosed with mental retardation had mercury concentrations in cord that were intermediate between the two other groups .
Using regression coefficients obtained at a study conducted at the Faroe Islands , the median cord mercury concentration from the children with Minamata disease is estimated to correspond to about 216 microg/L cord blood and 41 microg/g in maternal hair .
Based on correlations reported in the literature , the median daily mercury intake of the women whose children developed Minamata disease can then be estimated at about 225 microg .
Although these children had fully developed Minamata disease , the estimates of median mercury levels are only four to five times higher than current mercury exposure limits .
