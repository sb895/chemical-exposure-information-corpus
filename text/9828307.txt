Effects of postnatal exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) on thyroid hormone status were studied in the peripheral blood of 36 breast-fed Japanese infants .
Estimated total intakes of these chemicals in toxic equivalent quantity ( TEQ ) converted into 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( 2,3,7,8-TCDD ) from the breast milk significantly and negatively correlated with the levels of triiodothyronine ( T3 ) and thyroxine ( T4 ) in the blood of breast-fed babies .
Therefore , exposure to background levels of the highly toxic organochlorine chemicals through the breast milk may cause some effects on thyroid hormone status in Japanese infants .
