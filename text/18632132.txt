OBJECTIVE The objective was to grasp the recent body burden levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( DL-PCBs ) and to investigate their determinants among general inhabitants in Japan .
METHODS This study was performed on 1374 participants aged 15-73 years , who were not occupational exposure to PCDDs/PCDFs and DL-PCBs , living widely in 75 different residential areas of 25 prefectures in Japan .
Seven PCDDs , ten PCDFs , twelve DL-PCBs , which are assigned a toxicity equivalent factor , and biochemical factors were determined in fasting blood .
A questionnaire survey on life-style was also performed .
RESULTS The median of total toxicity equivalent ( TEQ ) was 20pgTEQ/g lipid .
The TEQs of PCDDs/PCDFs , DL-PCBs and total TEQ increased with age .
The intake frequency of fish-and-shellfish was positively associated with the TEQ of DL-PCBs in both sexes .
Current smoking was negatively related to the TEQ of DL-PCBs in male subjects but not in female subjects .
Feeding status was significantly related to the TEQs of PCDDs/PCDFs , DL-PCBs and total TEQ , being lowest in breast feeding and highest in never and bottle feeding .
According to the results of subgroup analysis , parity was not associated with the TEQs .
CONCLUSIONS The fish-and-shellfish consumption may contribute to the accumulation of DL-PCBs , and smoking may induce some biological action for the elimination of DL-PCBs from the human body .
Breast feeding is considered to be one of the major excretory pathways of PCDDs/PCDFs and DL-PCBs in women , while parity may not largely contribute to the elimination of these pollutants .
