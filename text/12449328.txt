Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and organochlorine pesticides , such as hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) are compounds widespread in the environment , highly lipophilic , and accumulate in biological systems .
The newborn are exposed to these organochlorine compounds across the placenta and through breastfeeding .
This study reports the levels of selected PCB congeners , p,p'-DDE and HCB in maternal blood and cord blood samples collected at delivery between November and December 1999 from 44 women living in the urban area of Antwerp , Belgium .
Results show that all newborns contained detectable levels of PCBs , p,p'-DDE and HCB .
The median concentration of PCBs was 450 pg/ml and ranged between 120 and 1580 pg/ml , while the median concentrations of HCB and p,p'-DDE were 70 and 490 pg/ml , respectively .
Concentrations of PCBs and p,p'-DDE in cord blood ( ng/ml ) were positively associated with concentrations in maternal blood ( ng/ml ) ( coefficients=0.74 and 0.92 , P<0.05 ) .
We conclude that all investigated organochlorine compounds have an efficient transplacental transfer .
