Untreated wastewater from the Mexico City basin has been used for decades to irrigate cropland in the Mezquital Valley , State of Hidalgo , Mexico .
Excess irrigation water recharges the near-surface aquifer that is used as a domestic water supply source .
We assessed the groundwater quality of three key groundwater sources of domestic water by analyzing for 24 trace metals , 67 target base/neutral/acid ( BNA ) organic compounds , nontarget BNA organics , 23 chlorinated pesticides , 20 polychlorinated biphenyls , and nitrate , as well as microbiological contaminants--coliforms , Vibrio cholerae , and Salmonella .
Study participants answered a questionnaire that estimated ingestion and dermal exposure to groundwater ; 10% of the sample reported frequent diarrhea and 9% reported persistent skin irritations .
Detection of V. cholerae non-01 in surface waters at all sites suggested a potential risk ( surrogate indicator present ) of diarrheal disease for canal and river bathers by accidental ingestion , as well as potential Vibrio contamination of near-surface groundwater and potential cholera risk , magnified by lapses in disinfection .
High total coliform levels in surface water and lower levels in groundwater at all sites indicated fecal contamination and a potential risk of gastrointestinal disease in populations exposed to inadequately disinfected groundwater .
Using chemical criteria , no significant risk from ingestion or dermal contact was identified at the method detection limits at any site , except from nitrate exposure : infants and young children are at risk from methemoglobinemia at all sites .
Results suggest that pathogen risk interventions are a priority , whereas nitrate risk needs further characterization to determine if formal treatment is needed .
The risks exist inside and outside the irrigation district .
The method was highly cost-effective .
