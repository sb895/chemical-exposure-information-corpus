To assess levels of chlorinated contaminants in breast milk , we measured organochlorine pesticides , polychlorinated biphenyls , polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) in breast milk samples collected in 1994 according to the World Health Organization protocol from 92 donors that were representative of regional populations in southern Kazakstan .
High levels ( 10-120 pg/g fat ) of 2,3,7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) , the most toxic of the PCDD/PCDF congeners , were found in breast milk samples from an agricultural region .
TCDD was the major contributor ( 75% ) to the international toxicity equivalents of these samples .
The same distinctive PCDD/PCDF congener pattern was found in 15 breast milk samples and 4 serum samples collected in 1996 in a follow-up study , and has now been confirmed by three analytical laboratories .
