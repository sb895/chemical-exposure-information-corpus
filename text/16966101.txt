We analyzed the chest radiographs ( CXRs ) of 249 clinically healthy children , 230 from southwest Mexico City and 19 from Tlaxcala .
In contrast to children from Tlaxcala , children from southwest Mexico City were chronically exposed to ozone levels exceeding the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards for an average of 4.7 hr/day and to concentrations of particulate matter ( PM ) with aerodynamic diameters </= 2.5 microm ( PM2.5 ) above the annual standard .
CXRs of Mexico City children demonstrated bilateral hyperinflation ( 151 of 230 ) and increased linear markings ( 121 of 230 ) .
Hyperinflation and interstitial markings were significantly more common in Mexico City children ( p < 0.0002 and 0.00006 respectively ) .
Mexico City boys had a higher probability of developing interstitial markings with age ( p = 0.004 ) .
Computed tomography ( CT ) scans were obtained in 25 selected Mexico City children with abnormal CXRs .
Mild bronchial wall thickening was seen in 10 of 25 , prominent central airways in 4 of 25 , air trapping in 8 of 21 , and pulmonary nodules in 2 of 21 .
Only 7.8% of Mexico City children had abnormal lung function tests based on predicted values .
These findings are consistent with bronchiolar , peribronchiolar , and/or alveolar duct inflammation , possibly caused by ozone , PM , and lipopolysaccharide exposure .
The epidemiologic implications of these findings are important for children residing in polluted environments , because bronchiolar disease could lead to chronic pulmonary disease later in life .
