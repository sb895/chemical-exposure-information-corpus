The non-occupational exposure to brominated flame retardants , and other persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) was studied by collecting human breast milk samples from mothers residing in Thohoyandou area , a rural district in the Limpopo Province , northern part of South Africa ( SA ) .
Of all collected samples to be analysed ( n=28 ) , those with large enough milk volumes , ( n=14 ) were quantified for polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) ( 9 congeners : BDE-28 , 47 , 66 , 99 , 100 , 138 , 153 , 154 , and 183 ) and hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) on a GC equipped with dual capillary columns and dual electron-capture detectors ( ECD ) .
The levels of PBDE congeners ( median sumBDE 1.3 ng/g of lipids ) and of HBCD were not far from levels generally found in European studies , and this study may be the first report on the presence of PBDEs and HBCD in SA breast milk .
On a congener basis , the finding of comparably high BDE-183 levels suggests a specific PBDE usage , or contamination situation in SA .
Apart from BFRs , the high DDT levels found in the breast milk from this area ( median and maximum sumDDT levels of about 4600 and over 20,000 ng/g of lipids , respectively ; n=28 ) have earlier been reported .
In addition , other POPs ( PCBs , HCB and HCHs ) were found in SA breast milk , at relatively low levels .
To conclude , measurable levels of PBDEs and HBCD , and a specific BDE congener pattern , were found in breast milk from the Limpopo province , SA .
A number of other POPs , including DDTs in high levels , were also present .
