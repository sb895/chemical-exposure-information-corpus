The purpose of this study was to compare the pattern of mortality of blue-collar workers employed less and more than 1 year in the man-made vitreous fiber ( MMVF ) and the reinforced plastic industries , the latter group being exposed to styrene .
We conducted an analysis among 21,784 workers with less than 1 year of employment ( short-term workers ) and 19,117 workers with 1 or more years of employment ( long-term workers ) employed in eight European countries .
We conducted analyses based on external as well as internal comparisons .
In both cohorts , the standardized mortality ratio for all causes among short-term workers was approximately 40% higher , compared with that for longer-term workers .
In internal comparisons , the difference was reduced to 9% in the MMVF cohort and 11% in the styrene cohort .
Workers with less than 1 month of employment displayed an increased mortality in both cohorts and in most countries .
The increased mortality among short-term workers was not concentrated shortly after they quit employment .
In both cohorts , short-term workers had a higher mortality from external causes , while little difference was seen in mortality from ischemic heart disease and malignant neoplasms .
Although extra-occupational factors may contribute to increase the mortality of short-term workers and , in particular , of those employed for less than 1 month , the difference observed in analyses adjusted for characteristics of employment suggested a relatively small difference in mortality from most causes .
