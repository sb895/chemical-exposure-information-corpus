INTRODUCTION We present data on the association of manganese ( Mn ) level with hypertension in a representative sample of the adult Korean population who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( KNHANES ) 2008 .
METHODS This study was based on the data obtained by KNHANES 2008 , which was conducted for three years ( 2007-2009 ) using a rolling sampling design involving a complex , stratified , multistage , probability-cluster survey of a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of South Korea .
RESULTS Multiple regression analysis after controlling for covariates , including gender , age , regional area , education level , smoking , drinking status , hemoglobin , and serum creatinine , showed that the beta coefficients of log blood Mn were 3.514 , 1.878 , and 2.517 for diastolic blood pressure , and 3.593 , 2.449 , and 2.440 for systolic blood pressure in female , male , and all participants , respectively .
Multiple regression analysis including three other blood metals , lead , mercury , and cadmium , revealed no significant effects of the three metals on blood pressure and showed no effect on the association between blood Mn and blood pressure .
In addition , doubling the blood Mn increased the risk of hypertension 1.828 , 1.573 , and 1.567 fold in women , men , and all participants , respectively , after adjustment for covariates .
The addition of blood lead , mercury , and cadmium as covariates did not affect the association between blood Mn and the prevalence of hypertension .
CONCLUSION Blood Mn level was associated with an increased risk of hypertension in a representative sample of the Korean adult population .
