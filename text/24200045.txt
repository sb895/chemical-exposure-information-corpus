Little data is available on the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) in marine organisms from South China Sea ( SCS ) .
Five marine fish species were collected from Yongxing Island , SCS to investigate the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites ( DDTs ) .
PBDEs , PCBs , and DDTs concentrations ranged from 2.0-117 , 6.3-199 , and 9.7-5831ng g(-1)lw , respectively .
In general , contaminants measured in this study were at the lower end of the global range .
Concentrations of PBDEs and PCBs were significantly correlated in fish samples , implying that PBDEs are as prevalent as PCBs in Yongxing Island .
Among the five fish species studied , yellow striped goatfish had the highest concentrations of PBDEs , PCBs , and DDTs , probably attributed to its different living and feeding habits .
The contaminant distribution pattern indicated that agrochemical source is more important than industrial source in Yongxing Island , SCS .
The average estimated daily intakes of PBDEs , PCBs , and DDTs via fish consumption by local residents in the coastal areas of South China ranged from 1.42-5.91 , 3.20-13.3 , and 8.08-33.6ngd(-1) , which were lower than those in previous studies , suggesting that consumption of marine fish in Yongxing Island , SCS , might not subject local residents to significant health risk as far as POPs are concerned .
This is the first study to report the occurrence of POPs in marine biota from SCS .
