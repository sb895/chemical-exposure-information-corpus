To assess how the human exposure to environmental carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) pollution sources generated from industrial , traffic and rural settings , we present a probabilistic risk model , appraised with reported empirical data .
A probabilistic risk assessment framework is integrated with the potency equivalence factors ( PEFs ) , age group-specific occupancy probability and the incremental lifetime cancer risk ( ILCR ) approaches to quantitatively estimate the exposure risk for three age groups of adults , children , and infants .
The benzo[a]pyrene equivalents based PAH concentrations in rural , traffic , and industrial areas associated with age group-specific occupancy probability at different environmental settings are used to calculate daily exposure level through inhalation and dermal contact pathways .
Risk analysis indicates that the inhalation-ILCR and dermal contact-ILCR values for adults follow a lognormal distribution with geometric mean 1.04x10(-4) and 3.85x10(-5) and geometric standard deviation 2.10 and 2.75 , respectively , indicating high potential cancer risk ; whereas for the infants the risk values are less than 10(-6) , indicating no significant cancer risk .
Sensitivity analysis indicates that the input variables of cancer slope factor and daily inhalation exposure level have the greater impact than that of body weight on the inhalation-ILCR ; whereas for the dermal-ILCR , particle-bound PAH-to-skin adherence factor and daily dermal exposure level have the significant influence than that of body weight .
