The Huludao zinc plant in Liaoning province , northeast China was the largest in Asia , and its smelting activities had seriously contaminated soil , water and atmosphere in the surrounding area .
For the first time , we investigated the total mercury ( THg ) content in maize , soybean , broomcorn , 22 vegetables , and the soil around their roots from eight sampling plots near the Huludao zinc plant .
THg contents of the seeds of maize , soybean , and broomcorn are 0.008 , 0.006 , and 0.057 mg kg(-1) , respectively , with the broomcorn being the highest , exceeding the maximum level of contaminant in food ( GB2762-2005 ) by 4.7 times .
The edible parts of vegetables are also contaminated with a range of mercury contents of 0.001-0.147 mg kg(-1) ( dry weight ) .
THg contents in plant tissue decrease in the order of leaves > root > stalk > grain .
Using correlation analysis , we show that mercury in the roots of these plants is mainly derived from soil , and the uptake of gaseous mercury is the predominant path by which the mercury accumulated in the foliage .
The average and maximum mercury daily intake ( DI ) of adult around the Huludao zinc plant via consuming vegetables are 0.015 and 0.051 microg/kg/d , respectively , and those of children are 0.02 and 0.07 microg/kg/d , respectively .
The average and maximum weekly intakes of total mercury for adult are 2.1 and 7.1% , respectively , of the provisional tolerable weekly intake ( PTWI ) , and 2.8 and 9.7% , respectively , of the PTWI for children .
