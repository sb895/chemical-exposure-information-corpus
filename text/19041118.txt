The prevalence of fluorosis is mainly due to the consumption of more fluoride through drinking water .
It is necessary to find out the fluoride endemic areas to adopt remedial measures to the people on the risk of fluorosis .
The objectives of this study are to estimate the fluoride exposure through drinking water from people of different age group and to elucidate the fluoride endemic areas through mapping .
Assessment of fluoride exposure was achieved through the estimation fluoride level in drinking water using fluoride ion selective electrode method .
Google earth and isopleth technique were used for mapping of fluoride endemic areas .
From the study it was observed that Nilakottai block of Dindigul district in Tamil Nadu is highly fluoride endemic .
About 88% of the villages in this block have fluoride level more than the prescribed permissible limit in drinking water .
Exposure of fluoride among different age groups was calculated in this block , which comprises 32 villages .
The maximum estimated exposure doses were 0.19 mg/kg/day for infants , 0.17 mg/kg/day for children and 0.10 mg/kg/day for adults .
When compared with adequate intake of minimal safe level exposure dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day for infants and 0.05 mg/kg/day for other age groups , a health risk due to fluorosis to the people in Nilakottai block has become evident .
From the results , the people in Nilakottai block are advised to consume drinking water with fluoride level less than 1 mg/l .
It has been recommended to the government authorities to take serious steps to supply drinking water with low fluoride concern for the fluorosis affected villages .
