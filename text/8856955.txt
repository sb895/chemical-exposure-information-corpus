The concentrations of persistent organochlorine contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , DDT ( its isomers and metabolites ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) and isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) have been determined in human milk samples from the three regions in the Czech Republic .
Results were generated by the congener-specific analyses ( two-dimensional high resolution gas chromatography ) .
The results are compared with the similar studies from other industrial countries ( Norway , Great Britain , the Netherlands and Germany ) .
Typical patterns of major PCBs contained in analyzed breast milk samples are presented .
PCB No.153 was the dominant congener in all the samples .
A good correlation was found between the sum of PCBs and PCB No.:153 ( r = 0.99 ) , constitutes approx. 30% of calculated PCBs content .
