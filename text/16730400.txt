By use of a Swedish Market basket study from 1999 , in which foods were sampled from four regions , the dietary intake of persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) was assessed .
Based on earlier data , six food groups ( fish , meat , dairy products , egg , fats/oils , and pastries ; comprising 52 food items ) were selected for POP analyses .
Homogenates from these six groups were subjected to POP analyses and levels presented on dioxins ( PCDD/PCDFs ) , dioxin-like PCBs , PCB-153 , summation operatorPCBs , BDE-47 , summation operatorPBDEs , DDE , summation operatorDDTs , HCB , summation operatorHCHs , and summation operatorchlordanes , after adjusting non-quantified levels to 1/2 LOQ .
For all compounds , the fish homogenate contained the comparatively highest levels , on a fresh weight basis .
Intake calculations based on the six food groups showed that summation operatorPCBs and summation operatorDDTs gave per capita intakes of 615 and 523 ng/day , respectively , that the estimated summation operatorPBDE intake was 51 ng/day and that of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs was 96 pg WHO-TEQ/day .
The estimated mean intakes were below ( total-TEQ : 1.3 pg/kgbw/day ) or well below ( summation operatorDDTs : 8.9 ng/kgbw/day ) internationally agreed intake limits ( total-TEQ : 2 pg/kgbw/day ; summation operatorDDTs : 10,000 ng/kgbw/day ) .
A number of uncertainty factors , including analytical limitations due to low POP levels in food , give reason for caution in the use of the presented intake data .
However , the intake estimations of dioxins , summation operatorPCBs and summation operatorPBDEs are well in accordance to calculations of POP intakes in Sweden made by alternate methods .
