Sources of bias were examined in a study of neurobehavioral effects of intrauterine exposure to methyl mercury in the Faroe Islands .
The cohort of 1000 children was born during a 21-month period and did not differ from Faroese births in general as regards major obstetrical parameters .
However , high mercury concentrations in the cord blood was associated with increased birth weight , presumably because other constituents of marine fish may cause a prolongation of the gestation period .
Thus , children with high mercury exposures were somewhat protected against low birth weight and its associated neurobehavioral risks .
Less than 25% of the women indicated occasional alcohol drinking during pregnancy , thus suggesting a limited fetal exposure to this neurobehavioral risk factor .
However , maternal alcohol drinking caused a decrease in mercury concentrations in cord blood , probably because of a toxicokinetic interaction between ethanol and mercury .
Any alcohol-related effect on neurobehavioral development would then be associated with lower levels of mercury exposures .
The effects of these confounders would tend to bias the results of the study toward the null hypothesis .
