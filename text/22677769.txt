Disturbance of trace element balance increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease and , above all , ischemic stroke ( IS ) .
A comparative analysis of clinical and demographic parameters and trace element composition of hair was performed in the group of 30 ischemic stroke patients with arterial hypertension ( AH ) and 30 stroke patients without hypertension ( mean age 55±7 years ) .
The stroke patients with hypertension were characterized by the elevated body mass index ( 28.5±4.1 kg/m2 , AI , 26.0±2.9 kg/m2 , p=0.006 ) , higher incidence of coronary heart disease ( p=0.04 ) .
Alcohol consumption more than 3 drinks a week was associated with a 5-fold increase of the risk of stroke with hypertension ( 95% CI 1.0-27 , p=0.035 ) .
The results revealed a number of statistically significant differences in trace element profile in the studied groups of patients : deficits of essential magnesium , manganese , cobalt , copper , zinc , a statistically significant increase in sodium levels , toxic and conditionally toxic trace elements ( cadmium , mercury , bismuth , barium , etc. ) .
One of the probable factors that lead to the accumulation of toxic trace elements in stroke patients is the increased consumption of alcohol including that of substandard quality .
The data obtained also show the feasibility of implementing screening programs to assess micronutrient status ( including trace elements ) for early detection of pathological abnormalities in the elemental homeostasis that might lead to an increased risk of ischemic stroke and hypertension .
