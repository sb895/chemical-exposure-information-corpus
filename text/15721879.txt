There is a rising global concern with regard to mercury ( Hg ) exposure among coastal populations .
Two communities on the Bay of Fundy ( New Brunswick , Canada ) were assessed by hair monitoring and dietary methods .
Average concentration of total Hg in hair was 0.70+/-0.55 mg/kg ( N=91 ) at Grand Manan and 0.42+/-0.15 mg/kg ( N=52 ) at St. Andrews/St .
Stephen .
Average daily consumption of fresh fish and shellfish was 50+/-40 g/day for Grand Manan and 19+/-19 g/day for St. Andrews/St .
Stephen .
Average daily total Hg intake estimated from the food frequency and 24-h recall questionnaires was 0.05+/-0.04 microg Hg/kg bw/day at Grand Manan and 0.03+/-0.04 microg Hg/kg bw/day at St. Andrews/St .
Stephen .
A significant correlation ( r=0.47 , P=0.002 ) between Hg intake and hair was observed for Grand Manan .
Low Hg intakes and body burden can be attributed to the low Hg levels found in the species commonly consumed : haddock , canned tuna , lobster , and pollock ( all below 0.2 microg/g wet weight ) .
The results showed that Hg exposure in these Canadian coastal communities is low ; fish with higher levels of Hg ( shark , tuna , swordfish , pickerel , and bass ) are not consumed locally .
