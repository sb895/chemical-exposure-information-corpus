AIM Autism is a neurological-psychiatric disease .
In the last 20 years we witnessed a strong increase of autism diagnoses .
To explain this increase , some scientists put forward the hypothesis that heavy metal intoxication may be one of the causes of autism .
The origin of such an intoxication was hypothesised to be vaccines containing thimerosal as antimicrobic preservative .
This preservative is mainly made up of mercury .
The aim of our research was to investigate the correlation between autism and high biological concentrations of heavy metals .
METHODS Seventeen autistic patients , between 6 and 16 years old ( average : 11.52 DS : 3.20 ) ( 15 males and 2 females ) , were investigated , as well as 20 non autistic subjects from neuropsychiatric service between 6 and 16 years ( average : 10.41 DS : 3.20 ) ( 15 males and 2 females ) .
In both groups blood , urine and hair samples were analysed trough means of a semiquantitative analysis of heavy metal dosing .
The metals analysed were Lead , mercury , cadmium and aluminium , since their build-up may give both neurological and psychiatric symptoms .
RESULTS The comparison of the mean values of the concentrations between the groups , performed with ANOVA test , has shown no statistically relevant differences .
CONCLUSION There wasn't correlation between autism and heavy metal concentration .
