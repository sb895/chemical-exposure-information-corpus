Human exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and brominated flame retardants ( BFRs ) such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs ) was evaluated in Ghana using breast milk samples collected in 2004 and 2009 .
Mean levels and ranges of PBDEs ( 4.5 ; 0.86-18 ng/g lw ) and PCBs ( 62 ; 15-160 ng/g lw ) observed in the present study were unexpectedly high , in spite of the fact that Ghana is a non-industrialized country when compared with many of the Asian and European countries .
Significant increases were found in the concentrations of PCBs and PBDEs over the years , while no significant increase was observed for HBCDs .
Estimated hazard quotient ( HQ ) showed that all the mothers had HQ values exceeding the threshold of 1 for PCBs , indicating potential health risk for their children .
PCBs in dirty oils and obsolete equipment should be of concern as potential sources in Ghana , and e-waste recycling with little or no experience in safe handling could be a threat to this sub-region noted for unregulated disposal of e-waste .
The results may point towards an increase in trends in human milk in Ghana , especially in the larger cities but further analysis would be required to confirm this upward trend in levels .
This is the first study to report BFRs in human breast milk from Africa , and undoubtedly from Ghana .
