Several phthalates , particularly diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) and di-n-butyl phthalate , can be used in personal care products ( PCPs ) to fix fragrance and hold color .
We investigated associations between women's reported use of PCPs within the 24 h before urine collection and concentrations of several urinary phthalate metabolites .
Between 2002 and 2005 , 337 women provided spot urine samples and answered questions regarding their use of 13 PCPs at a follow-up visit 3-36 months after pregnancy .
We examined associations between urinary concentrations of several phthalate metabolites and use of PCPs using linear regression .
Use of individual PCPs ranged from 7% ( nail polish ) to 91% ( deodorant ) .
After adjusting for age , education , and urinary creatinine , women reporting use of perfume had 2.92 times higher ( 95% CI : 2.20-3.89 ) concentration of monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ; the primary metabolite of DEP ) than other women .
Other PCPs that were significantly associated with MEP concentrations included : hair spray , nail polish , and deodorant .
MEP concentrations increased with the number of PCPs used .
PCP use was widespread in this group of recently pregnant women .
Women's use of PCPs , particularly of perfumes and fragranced products , was positively associated with urinary concentration of multiple phthalate metabolites .
