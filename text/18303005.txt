Previous research provided evidence of an association between short-term exposure to ozone and mortality risk and of heterogeneity in the risk across communities .
The authors investigated whether this heterogeneity can be explained by community-specific characteristics : race , income , education , urbanization , transportation use , particulate matter and ozone levels , number of ozone monitors , weather , and use of air conditioning .
Their study included data on 98 US urban communities for 1987 to 2000 from the National Morbidity , Mortality , and Air Pollution Study ; US Census ; and American Housing Survey .
On average across the communities , a 10-ppb increase in the previous week's ozone level was associated with a 0.52% ( 95% posterior interval : 0.28 , 0.77 ) increase in mortality .
The authors found that community-level characteristics modify the relation between ozone and mortality .
Higher effect estimates were associated with higher unemployment , fraction of the Black/African-American population , and public transportation use and with lower temperatures or prevalence of central air conditioning .
These differences may relate to underlying health status , differences in exposure , or other factors .
Results show that some segments of the population may face higher health burdens of ozone pollution .
