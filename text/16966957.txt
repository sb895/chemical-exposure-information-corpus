OBJECTIVE Bar and restaurant workers ' exposure to secondhand smoke ( SHS ) was compared before and 3 and 6 months after implementation of a smoke-free ordinance .
METHODS Hair nicotine , self-reported exposure to SHS , and respiratory symptoms were assessed on 105 smoking and nonsmoking workers from randomly selected establishments in Lexington , Kentucky .
Thirty-eight percent were current smokers with more than half smoking 10 or fewer cigarettes per day .
Workers provided a hair sample at baseline and at the 3-month interview .
RESULTS There was a significant decline in hair nicotine 3 months postlaw when controlling for cigarettes smoked per day .
Bar workers showed a significantly larger decline in hair nicotine compared with restaurant workers .
The only significant decline in SHS exposure was in the workplace and other public places .
Regardless of smoking status , respiratory symptoms declined significantly postlaw .
CONCLUSIONS Hospitality workers demonstrated significant declines in hair nicotine and respiratory symptoms after the law .
Comprehensive smoke-free laws can provide the greatest protection to bar workers who are the most vulnerable to SHS exposure at work .
