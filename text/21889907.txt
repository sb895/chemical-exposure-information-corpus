The exposure of the general population to phthalates is of increasing public health concern .
Variations in the internal exposure of the population are likely , because the amounts , distribution and application characters of the phthalate use change over time .
Estimating the chronological sequences of the phthalate exposure , we performed a retrospective human biomonitoring study by investigating the metabolites of the five most prominent phthalates in urine .
Therefore , 24h-urine samples from the German Environmental Specimen Bank ( ESB ) collected from 240 subjects ( predominantly students , age range 19-29 years , 120 females , 120 males ) in the years 2002 , 2004 , 2006 and 2008 ( 60 individuals each ) , were analysed for the concentrations of mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MnBP ) as metabolite of di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) , mono-iso-butyl phthalate ( MiBP ) as metabolite of di-iso-butyl phthalate ( DiBP ) , mono-benzyl phthalate ( MBzP ) as metabolite of butylbenzyl phthalate ( BBzP ) , mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( MEHP ) , mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate ( 5OH-MEHP ) , mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate ( 5oxo-MEHP ) , mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate ( 5cx-MEPP ) and mono-(2-carboxymethyl hexyl ) phthalate ( 2cx-MMHxP ) as metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) , monohydroxylated ( OH-MiNP ) , monooxidated ( oxo-MiNP ) and monocarboxylated ( cx-MiNP ) mono-iso-nonylphthalates as metabolites of di-iso-nonyl phthalates ( DiNP ) .
Based on the urinary metabolite excretion , together with results of a previous study , which covered the years 1988-2003 , we investigated the chronological sequences of the phthalate exposure over two decades .
In more than 98% of the urine samples metabolites of all five phthalates were detectable indicating a ubiquitous exposure of people living in Germany to all five phthalates throughout the period investigated .
The medians in samples from the different years investigated are 65.4 ( 2002 ) , 38.5 ( 2004 ) , 29.3 ( 2006 ) and 19.6 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for MnBP , 31.4 ( 2002 ) , 25.4 ( 2004 ) , 31.8 ( 2006 ) and 25.5 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for MiBP , 7.8 ( 2002 ) , 6.3 ( 2004 ) , 3.6 ( 2006 ) and 3.8 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for MBzP , 7.0 ( 2002 ) , 5.6 ( 2004 ) , 4.1 ( 2006 ) and 3.3 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for MEHP , 19.6 ( 2002 ) , 16.2 ( 2004 ) , 13.2 ( 2006 ) and 9.6 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for 5OH-MEHP , 13.9 ( 2002 ) , 11.8 ( 2004 ) , 8.3 ( 2006 ) and 6.4 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for 5oxo-MEHP , 18.7 ( 2002 ) , 16.5 ( 2004 ) , 13.8 ( 2006 ) and 10.2 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for 5cx-MEPP , 7.2 ( 2002 ) , 6.5 ( 2004 ) , 5.1 ( 2006 ) and 4.6 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for 2cx-MMHxP , 3.3 ( 2002 ) , 2.8 ( 2004 ) , 3.5 ( 2006 ) and 3.6 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for OH-MiNP , 2.1 ( 2002 ) , 2.1 ( 2004 ) , 2.2 ( 2006 ) and 2.3 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for oxo-MiNP and 4.1 ( 2002 ) , 3.2 ( 2004 ) , 4.1 ( 2006 ) and 3.6 \u03bcg/l ( 2008 ) for cx-MiNP .
The investigation of the time series 1988-2008 indicates a decrease of the internal exposure to DnBP by the factor of 7-8 and to DEHP and BzBP by the factor of 2-3 .
In contrast , an increase of the internal exposure by the factor of 4 was observed for DiNP over the study period .
The exposure to DiBP was found to be stable .
In summary , we found decreases of the internal human exposure for legally restricted phthalates whereas the exposure to their substitutes increased .
Future investigations should verify these trends .
This is of increasing importance since the European Commission decided to require ban or authorization from 1.1.2015 for DEHP , DnBP , DiBP and BzBP according to REACh Annex XIV .
