Increased consumption of lake fish was associated with higher blood mercury concentrations among 289 residents of Southwest Quebec living on the southern bank of the Upper St. Lawrence River System .
This increase in blood mercury was reflected in the organic fraction and to a lesser extent with total blood mercury .
Repeat analyses on a small subpopulation showed a correlation coefficient between time 1 and time 2 of approximately 0.7 for total mercury and for organic mercury .
With one exception , blood total mercury concentrations were less than 5 ppb .
Blood mercury concentrations were higher among men than women .
One individual had much higher total mercury concentrations in blood ( i.e. , 70 ppb ) which were attributed to fish consumption based on medical and dietary history .
The values for these subjects are compared with other North American data on blood mercury levels .
