Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and organochlorine pesticides are persistent organic pollutants that have a widespread distribution in the environment .
Human biomonitoring is a suitable tool to assess the burden of humans with these substances .
Over a time span of 8 years , a free analysis of their milk was offered to lactating mothers residing in the state of Lower Saxony , Germany .
The human milk was analyzed for a number of organic chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane ( DDT ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane ( beta-HCH ) .
Factors that may influence these levels were investigated using a questionnaire .
In total , 4314 samples were collected in the years 1999-2006 and analyzed for their content of these persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) .
A clear downward trend of median total PCB , DDT , beta-HCH and HCB values in all participants and also in different selected subgroups could be observed .
The median values of calculated total PCB in the year 2006 including all participants was 0.1825mg/kg lipid , that of DDT 0.0815mg/kg lipid , beta-HCH 0.0116mg/kg lipid and of HCB 0.0229mg/kg lipid .
There were reductions between 40.9% and 47.1% compared to the year 1999 .
Among other influencing factors , median concentrations of total PCB , DDT , beta-HCH and HCB showed a clear rise with increasing age of mothers whereas an increasing number of breastfed infants per mother led to a decrease .
The proportions of other measured substances exceeding limits of quantification were as follows : dieldrin 68.6% , alpha-HCH 1.3% , gamma-HCH 60.1% , heptachlor epoxide 41.5% , musk xylene 15.6% , musk ambrette 0.4% .
We conclude that the known declining trend of important xenobiotic substances in human milk of German mothers has continued .
