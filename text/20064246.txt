BACKGROUND Elevated concentrations of mercury have been documented in fish in Lake Chapala in central Mexico , an area that is home to a large subsistence fishing community .
However , neither the extent of human mercury exposure nor its sources and routes have been elucidated .
METHODS Total mercury concentrations were measured in samples of fish from Lake Chapala ; in sections of sediment cores from the delta of Rio Lerma , the major tributary to the lake ; and in a series of suspended-particle samples collected at sites from the mouth of the Lerma to mid-Lake .
A cross-sectional survey of 92 women ranging in age from 18-45 years was conducted in three communities along the Lake to investigate the relationship between fish consumption and hair mercury concentrations among women of child-bearing age .
RESULTS Highest concentrations of mercury in fish samples were found in carp ( mean 0.87 ppm ) .
Sediment data suggest a pattern of moderate ongoing contamination .
Analyses of particles filtered from the water column showed highest concentrations of mercury near the mouth of the Lerma .
In the human study , 27.2% of women had >1 ppm hair mercury .
On multivariable analysis , carp consumption and consumption of fish purchased or captured from Lake Chapala were both associated with significantly higher mean hair mercury concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary data indicate that , despite a moderate level of contamination in recent sediments and suspended particulate matter , carp in Lake Chapala contain mercury concentrations of concern for local fish consumers .
Consumption of carp appears to contribute significantly to body burden in this population .
Further studies of the consequences of prenatal exposure for child neurodevelopment are being initiated .
