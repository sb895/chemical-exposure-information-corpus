The mean concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) ( sum tetra- to octaBDEs ) were determined in samples of foodstuffs widely consumed by the population of Catalonia , Northeast Spain .
The following six tetra-through heptabrominated congeners were also individually analyzed : PBDEs 47 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 154 and 183 .
Food samples were randomly acquired in 12 cities of Catalonia between March and June of 2006 .
The dietary intake of PBDEs was estimated for the population of this region .
In order to determine the temporal trend on the exposure to PBDEs through the diet , the results were compared with those of a previous survey performed during 2000 .
The highest concentration of total PBDEs was found in fish and shellfish ( 563.9 ng/kg of wet weight ) , followed by oils and fats ( 359.3 ng/kg ww ) , and bakery products ( 98.8 ng/kg ww ) .
Among six individually analyzed congeners , for most food groups BDE-47 and BDE-99 showed the highest levels .
The dietary intake of PBDEs for a standard male adult of 70 kg body weight was 75.4 ng/day ( or 1.1 ng/kg body weight/day , assuming ND=LOD/2 ) .
On a body weight basis , it means a decrease of 23% with respect to the daily intake of the 2000 survey ( 97.3 ng/day or 1.4 ng/kg/body weight/day ) .
Finally , the current PBDE intake is compared with the results of recent studies on the dietary intake of PBDEs performed in various European , North American , and Asian countries .
