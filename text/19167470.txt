Chronic exposure to arsenic , a potent carcinogen and toxicant , via drinking water is a worldwide public health problem .
Because little is known about early-life effects of arsenic on immunity , we evaluated the impact of in utero exposure on infant immune parameters and morbidity in a pilot study .
Pregnant women were enrolled at 6-10 weeks of gestation in Matlab , a rural area of Bangladesh , extensively affected by arsenic contamination of tubewell water .
Women ( n=140 ) delivering at local clinics were included in the study .
Anthropometry and morbidity data of the pregnant women and their children , as well as infant thymic size by sonography were collected .
Maternal urine and breast milk were collected for immune marker and arsenic assessment .
Maternal urinary arsenic during pregnancy showed significant negative correlation with interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) and lactoferrin ( Ltf ) in breast milk and child thymic index ( TI ) .
Urinary arsenic was also positively associated with fever and diarrhea during pregnancy and acute respiratory infections ( ARI ) in the infants .
The effect of arsenic exposure on ARI was only evident in male children .
The findings suggest that in utero arsenic exposure impaired child thymic development and enhanced morbidity , probably via immunosuppression .
The effect seemed to be partially gender dependent .
Arsenic exposure also affected breast milk content of trophic factors and maternal morbidity .
