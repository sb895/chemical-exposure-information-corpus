Unborn children are exposed to environmental pollutants via the placenta , and there is a causal relationship between maternal intake of pollutants and fetal exposure .
Placental examination is an effective way for acquiring data for estimating fetal exposure .
We analyzed the concentrations of 104 congeners of persistent organic pollutants , seven organotin compounds , five heavy metals , and methylmercury in 130 randomly selected placentas .
Additionally , we examined similarities between pollutant concentrations by analyzing correlations between their placental concentrations .
Our results yield new information for conducting contaminant risk assessments for the prenatal period .
Out of the 117 individual persistent organic pollutants or metals assayed , 46 could be detected in more than half of the placentas .
Moreover , dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) was found in all placentas .
The data indicates that fetal exposure to dioxins and furans ( PCDD/Fs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , p,p'-DDE , and methylmercury depends on the mother's parity , and age .
We also conclude that sources of the above four pollutants are similar but differ from the sources of polybrominated diphenyl ethers .
