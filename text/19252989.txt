During the recent two decades , a remarkable drop in fertility rates has been noticed almost all over the world .
A series of studies have showed that environmental factors had the primary role causing the observed adverse trends in the male reproductive health problems .
Especially chlorinated hydrocarbons , for instance polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) and pesticides , could mimic or antagonize the effects of steroid hormones , like estrogens and androgens and possibly interfering with male reproductive capacity .
Organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) ( i.e. p.p'-DDT , endosulfan... ) and PCBs are widespread used chemicals in agriculture and industry for different purposes all over the world .
Although direct evidence is lacking , theoretical considerations and epidemiological evidence implicate these compounds as potential hazards to human and wildlife reproductive health .
For this purpose , in this study adipose tissue samples have provided from healthy males which were diagnosed as infertile men living in Ankara , Turkey at least for 5 years .
Residual levels of OCPs ( alpha-BHC , beta-BHC , gamma-BHC , HCB , Endosulfan I , II , p,p'-DDE , and p,p'-DDT ) and seven major persistent PCB congeners ( PCB 28 , 52 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 , and 180 ) were measured in 25 infertile men and 21 healthy men's adipose tissue samples by GC-ECD .
Levels of OCPs and PCBs in adipose tissue of infertile men compared with those provided from controls .
When the concentrations of each of the OCP were compared between the fertile and infertile groups , no statistical significance was obtained .
Concentrations of each of the PCB congeners were compared between the fertile and infertile groups , no statistical significance was obtained ( p > 0.05 ) , except for 2,2',5,5'-Tetrachlorobiphenyl ( PCB 52 ) ( p = 0.032 ) and 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptachlorobiphenyl ( PCB 180 ) ( p = 0.017 ) .
