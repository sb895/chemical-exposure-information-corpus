Malathion was applied to roses in three Finnish greenhouses by hand held lance sprayers .
The potential dermal exposure of applicators to this insecticide was measured .
Total urine production of each applicator was also collected up to 24 h post application .
In the urine samples the specific metabolite of malathion , malathion monocarboxylic acid ( MMA ) , and the creatinine content were determined .
The potential dermal exposure results show that during the application of malathion , the applicators ' lower limbs accounted , on average , for 48% , while the upper limbs accounted for 19% of the potential dermal exposure .
Moreover , hands and chest and back and head regions accounted for 30 and 3% , respectively .
Based on the urine measurements , it was observed that the excretion of MMA was very rapid reaching a maximum at about 6-7 h after the completion of the application .
In the urine samples collected , MMA was found to be present in relatively small amounts .
