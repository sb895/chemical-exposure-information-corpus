In order to investigate the residual amounts of organochlorines and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in Korean human tissues ( blood , adipose tissue , liver , kidney cortex , and lung ) , the samples were collected from the autopsied cadavers of 40 men and 40 women ( from teens to seventies of age ) .
Alpha-BHC , beta-BHC , gamma-BHC , delta-BHC , p,p'-DDT , p,p'-DDD , p,p'-DDE , endrin , dieldein , aldrin , and 7 marker PCBs ( 28 , 52 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 , and 180 ) were determined in human tissues .
The levels of organochlorines and PCB congeners indicated that they have been widely distributed in Korean human body .
Positive correlations in terms of age were observed for the following cases : p,p'-DDE , p,p'-DDT , Sigma-DDT , PCB 118 , PCB 138 , PCB 153 , and Sigma-PCB in the adipose tissue , and p,p'-DDE in the lung .
Concentration of these compounds showed a significant age-related increase .
Accumulation of these compounds in aged people revealed that these compounds were more slowly eliminated in our environment and risk assessment was necessary for further proper action .
Significant differences in the levels of PCBs between genders were found for PCB 118 in the adipose tissue and PCB 138 in the liver .
Positive correlation coefficients between tissues were detected with p,p'-DDE and p-BHC .
