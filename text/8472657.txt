Neurobehavioral effects in 30 female workers ( aged 18-41 , mean 25.6 ) exposed to an average of 341 mg/m3 ( SD 100 ) toluene for an average of 5.7 years ( SD 3.3 ) compared with 30 matched controls ( aged 18-48 , mean 25.1 ) , 24 male workers ( aged 18-32 , mean 24.7 ) exposed to 268 mg/m3 ( SD 185 ) toluene equivalent of mixed solvent ( 82.2% toluene , 12.3% ethyl acetate , and 5.5% methyl ethyl ketone ) for 2.3 years ( SD 3.0 ) compared with 24 matched controls ( aged 17-31 , mean 24.3 ) , and 94 dentists ( aged 24-49 , mean 31.7 ) exposed to 0.017 mg/m3 ( SD 0.009 ) of elemental mercury for 7.4 years ( SD 5.3 ) compared with 54 referents ( aged 23-50 , mean 33.6 ) were studied .
The Z score ( made up of Digit Span , Symbols Digit , and Grooved Peg Board ) for the workers exposed to toluene was 0.79 , for workers exposed to mixed solvents was 0.38 , and for the dentists exposed to mercury was 0.42 .
The Z score for each group of exposed subjects was statistically poorer than that for its controls .
Neurobehavioral performance was statistically related to exposure intensity for the toluene-exposed workers and to years of exposure or dose ( exposure intensity x years of exposure ) for mixed solvent- and mercury-exposed subjects .
The type of chemical species and pattern of exposure appear to influence whether the adverse effects will be cumulative .
