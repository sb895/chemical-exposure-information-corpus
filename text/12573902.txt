Increases in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( NHL ) incidence and mortality rates during the past few decades remain largely unexplained .
Studies suggest that organochlorine pesticides may contribute to an increased risk of NHL .
In 1974 , serum samples were obtained from 25,802 participants in the Campaign Against Cancer and Stroke in Washington County , Maryland ( USA ) , and cryopreserved for future study .
We measured prediagnostic levels of chlordane , lindane ( gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane ) , beta-hexachlorocyclohexane , transnonachlor , heptachlor , heptachlor epoxide , oxychlordane , dieldrin , and hexachlorobenzene in serum samples of 74 cases of NHL and 147 matched controls .
Previously , we found an association between NHL and serum levels of total PCBs ( polychlorinated biphenyls ) , but not DDT ( dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ) and related compounds .
In this instance , there was no evidence of an association between NHL risk and serum levels of any of the individual lipid- and recovery-corrected organochlorines that we evaluated , nor of the summed chlordane-related compounds ( transnonachlor , heptachlor , heptachlor epoxide , oxychlordane ) .
These findings do not support the hypothesis that the organochlorine compounds included in this study are strongly linked to the development of NHL .
The possibility of a weak association cannot be excluded by these data .
