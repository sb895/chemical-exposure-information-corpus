BACKGROUND Arsenic methylation relies on folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and facilitates urinary As elimination .
Clinical manifestations of As toxicity vary considerably among individuals and populations , and poor methylation capacity is thought to confer greater susceptibility .
OBJECTIVE After determining that folate deficiency , hyperhomocysteinemia , and low urinary creatinine are associated with reduced As methylation , and that As exposure is associated with increased genomic methylation of leukocyte DNA , we asked whether these factors are associated with As-induced skin lesion risk among Bangladeshi adults .
METHODS We conducted a nested case-control study of 274 cases who developed lesions 2 years after recruitment , and 274 controls matched to cases for sex , age , and water As .
RESULTS The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for development of skin lesions for participants who had low folate ( < 9 nmol/L ) , hyperhomocysteinemia ( men , > 11.4 micromol/L ; women , > 10.4 micromol/L ) , or hypomethylated leukocyte DNA at recruitment ( < median ) were 1.8 ( 95% CI , 1.1-2.9 ) , 1.7 ( 95% CI , 1.1-2.6 ) , and 1.8 ( 95% CI , 1.2-2.8 ) , respectively .
Compared with the subjects in the first quartile , those in the third and fourth quartiles for urinary creatinine had a 0.4-fold decrease in the odds of skin lesions ( p < 0.01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that folate deficiency , hyperhomocysteinemia , and low urinary creatinine , each associated with decreased As methylation , are risk factors for As-induced skin lesions .
The increased DNA methylation associated with As exposure previously observed , and confirmed among controls in this study , may be an adaptive change because hypomethylation of leukocyte DNA is associated with increased risk for skin lesions .
