Road dust , household total suspended particulate matters ( TSP ) and PM\u2082.\u2085 were collected in urban area of Guangzhou , south of China , to investigate the concentrations of total mercury ( THg ) and methyl mercury ( MeHg ) .
The household PM\u2082.\u2085 concentrations varied between 16.2 and 623 μg/m³ .
The average PM\u2082.\u2085 level ( 174 μg/m³ ) from all of the locations exceeded 24-h concentration from WHO air quality guideline The average concentrations of THg and MeHg were : 235 \u03bcg/kg and 0.392 \u03bcg/kg in road dust , 600 \u03bcg/kg and 1.49 \u03bcg/kg in TSP ; 1006 \u03bcg/kg ( 104 pg/m³ ) and 1.40 \u03bcg/kg ( 0.134 pg/m³ ) in PM\u2082.\u2085 .
Risk assessment showed that the Hazardous quotients ( HQs ) of exposure to Hg and MeHg via road dust and TSP were less than 1 , indicating that no adverse risk was manifested .
Ingestion of dust was found to constitute a relatively minor pathway of Guangzhou residents ' exposure to Hg .
Furthermore , human hair samples from 88 Guangzhou citizens were also analyzed to investigate the mercury accumulation in human body in Guangzhou .
The average concentrations of THg and MeHg in human hair samples were 869±831 \u03bcg/kg and 104±108 \u03bcg/kg respectively .
However , no significant correlations of the mercury species were noted between human hair and road dust , TSP and PM\u2082.\u2085 .
