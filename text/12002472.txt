Four samples of Chinese tea ( two green teas , and two brick teas ) were analyzed for their concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDD/PCDF ) , chlorinated pesticides and PAH .
The infusions prepared from these teas were also analyzed for PCDD/PCDF .
The levels of DDT and its metabolites in tea leaves were within the safety limit of 0.2 mg/kg .
Rather high levels of total PAH were obtained in brick tea ( 1,048-1,162 mg/kg). when compared with green tea ( 497-517 mg/kg ) .
In terms of PCDD/PCDF , the concentrations of green tea and brick tea differed by a factor of 16 , while the concentrations of all infusions were within a factor of 2 .
The dioxin concentrations in green tea leaves can be explained through uptake of atmospheric PCDD/PCDF .
The higher concentrations in the brick tea leaves are due the longer exposure time , and to certain extent , the use of old leaves , branches and roots when making the tea , and additional components such as soil particulates through contamination .
Certain Chinese populations drinking a large amount of brick tea ( >31 per day ) indicated that individuals of these populations consume more tea than Europeans or North Americans result in a comparably higher intake of PCDD/PCDF .
Tea consumption can attribute to up to 10% of the TDI recommended by WHO ( only PCDD/PCDF considered , no PCB analyzed ) .
