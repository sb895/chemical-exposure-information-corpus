In 1979 , a mass poisoning involving 2,000 people occurred in central Taiwan from ingestion of cooking oil contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) .
We studied the prevalence of medical conditions in the exposed individuals and in a neighborhood control group .
Starting with a registry of the exposed individuals from 1983 , we updated the addresses of exposed individuals and identified a control group matched for age , sex , and neighborhood in 1979 .
In 1993 , individuals 30 years of age or older were interviewed by telephone .
We obtained usable information from 795 exposed subjects and 693 control subjects .
Lifetime prevalence of chloracne , abnormal nails , hyperkeratosis , skin allergy , goiter , headache , gum pigmentation , and broken teeth were observed more frequently in the PCB/PCDF-exposed men and women .
The exposed women reported anemia 2. 3 times more frequently than controls .
The exposed men reported arthritis and herniated intervertebral disks 4.1 and 2.9 times , respectively , more frequently than controls .
There was no difference in reported prevalences of other medical conditions .
We conclude that Taiwanese people exposed to high levels of PCBs and PCDFs reported more frequent medical problems , including skin diseases , goiter , anemia , and joint and spine diseases .
