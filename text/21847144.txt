Exposure assessment analyses conducted in Europe have concluded that the primary pathway of exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) is through the diet .
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether urinary DEHP metabolite data from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey ( NHANES ) demonstrate relationships with reported food-fasting time consistent with diet as the predominant exposure pathway .
Previous controlled-dosing data demonstrate that DEHP metabolite concentrations in urine first rise and then decline over time , with first-order elimination becoming evident at about 6 h post exposure .
Regression of the concentrations of four key DEHP metabolites vs reported fasting times between 6 and 18 h in adults resulted in apparent population-based urinary elimination half-lives , consistent with those previously determined in a controlled-dosing experiment , supporting the importance of the dietary pathway for DEHP .
For fasting times less than about 6 h , sampling session ( morning , afternoon , or evening ) affected the measured metabolite concentrations .
Evening samples showed the highest metabolite concentrations , supporting a hypothesis of recent daily dietary exposures from multiple meals , whereas morning and afternoon samples for fasting times less than 6 h were similar and somewhat lower than evening samples , consistent with less-substantial early day dietary exposure .
Variations in children's bodyweight-normalized creatinine excretion and food intake rates contribute to a strong inverse relationship between urinary DEHP metabolite concentrations and age under age 18 .
Finally , a previously published pharmacokinetic model for DEHP demonstrates that time since previous urinary void , a parameter not measured in NHANES , is predicted to result in non-random effects on measured urinary concentrations .
