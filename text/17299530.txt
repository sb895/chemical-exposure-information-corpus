The aim of this study was to assess exposure to pesticides for a longitudinal epidemiological study on adverse reproduction effects among greenhouse workers .
Detailed information on pesticide use among greenhouse workers was obtained on a monthly basis through self-administered questionnaires and subsequent workplace surveys .
Questionnaires were filled in for a whole year .
Dermal exposure rankings were developed for each task using the observational method Dermal Exposure Assessment Method ( DREAM ) .
Exposure scores were calculated for each worker for each month during the year , taking into account frequency , duration and exposure intensity for each task .
A total number of 116 different active ingredients were used in the population , whereas a mean number of 15 active ingredients were applied per greenhouse .
DREAM observations provided insight into the exposure intensity of 12 application techniques and three mixing and loading activities .
Relatively high DREAM scores were obtained for scattering , fogging , dusting , and mixing and loading of powders .
Observations with DREAM indicated that application with a horizontal ground-boom , motor driven boom , and bulb shower resulted in low dermal exposure .
Exposure scores showed substantial variation between workers and over the year .
It can be concluded that exposure variation between- and within greenhouses is very large , both in terms of chemical composition and exposure intensity .
This may be a significant contributor to the inconsistent results of studies evaluating health effects of pesticide exposure .
