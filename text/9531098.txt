Environmental and medical evaluations were performed to evaluate occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) among casino employees .
Air concentrations of both nicotine and respirable dust were similar to those published in the literature for other non-industrial indoor environments .
The geometric mean serum cotinine level of the 27 participants who provided serum samples was 1.34 nanograms per milliliter ( ng/mL ) ( pre-shift ) and 1.85 ng/mL ( post-shift ) .
Both measurements greatly exceeded the geometric mean value of 0.65 ng/mL for participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) who reported exposure to ETS at work .
This evaluation demonstrates that a sample of employees working in a casino gaming area were exposed to ETS at levels greater than those observed in a representative sample of the US population , and that the serum and urine cotinine of these employees increased during the workshift .
