The epidemiological evidence that ambient exposure , including particulate matter ( PM ) is related to adverse health outcomes continues to mount .
Inflammation and disease of the upper respiratory tract are commonly suggested as effects of ambient exposure .
Therefore we studied both ambient exposure and nasal effects in a 4-months cross-sectional survey in Nordrhein-Westfalen ( Germany ) .
At 4 locations in 3 different cities ambient exposure to TSP ( total suspended particles ) , O3 , NOx and SO2 was derived from compliance measurements by governmental offices , and 884 subjects ( 501 mothers and 383 children , 6-7 years old ) were screened using nasal lavage , with success rates of 90 and 75% , respectively .
No differences in total cell counts or percentage of neutrophils were found between mothers or children from the 4 different locations , despite small but significant differences in ambient exposure to TSP , SO2 , O3 , and NOx during this period .
A higher epithelial cell count in mothers and children from one city might be related to general higher ambient pollution in that location .
Interestingly , total cells and interleukin-8 levels in children were higher than in mothers and possibly reflect their increased susceptibility to effects of air pollution .
Future analysis will concentrate on temporal relations between inflammation and exposure , including individual risk factors such as allergy , smoking and the presence of disease .
