Certain complications of pregnancy , e.g. , threatened spontaneous abortion , toxemia , emesis , and anemia , were studied in pregnant women living in industrial areas contaminated by smelters and the petrochemical industry .
Exposure to lead or aromatic hydrocarbons was assessed in parallel by the determination of these agents or their metabolites in blood and urine .
Comparison of respective exposure levels was made between women with normal pregnancies and those with complications .
Significantly higher levels of lead in blood and increased excretion of the metabolic products of organic solvents were found in women with complicated pregnancies compared to those with normal pregnancies .
Threatened spontaneous abortion , toxemia , and anemia were associated with higher lead exposure in the vicinity of smelters .
In these patients , evidence of disturbances of blood glutathione equilibrium and increased lipid peroxidation were found indicating a decreased ability to compensate for the effects of exposure .
Styrene exposure in a petrochemical industrial area was associated mainly with late toxemia and nephropathy .
Patients with these complications also had a tendency to elevated exposure to other aromatic hydrocarbons .
It is suggested that complications of pregnancy may be induced by environmental agents at levels lower than those that result in pregnancy loss or preterm birth .
