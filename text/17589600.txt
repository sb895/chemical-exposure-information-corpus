BACKGROUND There is a need to identify and evaluate an effective mitigation program for arsenic exposure from drinking water in Bangladesh .
OBJECTIVE We evaluated the effectiveness of a multifaceted mitigation program to reduce As exposure among 11,746 individuals in a prospective cohort study initiated in 2000 in Araihazar , Bangladesh , by interviewing participants and measuring changes in urinary As levels .
METHODS The interventions included a ) person-to-person reporting of well test results and health education ; b ) well labeling and village-level health education ; and c ) installations of 50 deep , low-As community wells in villages with the highest As exposure .
RESULTS Two years after these interventions , 58% of the 6,512 participants with unsafe wells ( As >/=50 microg ) at baseline had responded by switching to other wells .
Well labeling and village-level health education was positively related to switching to safe wells ( As < 50 mug/L ) among participants with unsafe wells [ rate ratio ( RR ) = 1.84 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.60-2.11 ] and inversely related to any well switching among those with safe wells ( RR = 0.80 ; 95% CI , 0.66-0.98 ) .
The urinary As level in participants who switched to a well identified as safe ( < 50 microg As/L ) dropped from an average of 375 microg As/g creatinine to 200 microg As/g creatinine , a 46% reduction toward the average urinary As content of 136 microg As/g creatinine for participants that used safe wells throughout .
Urinary As reduction was positively related to educational attainment , body mass index , never-smoking , absence of skin lesions , and time since switching ( p for trend < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that testing of wells and informing households of the consequences of As exposure , combined with installation of deep community wells where most needed , can effectively address the continuing public health emergency from arsenic in drinking water in Bangladesh .
