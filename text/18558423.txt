Cadmium may act like an estrogen and be a potential risk factor for estrogen-related diseases such as breast cancer and endometriosis .
Here , we tested the hypothesis that higher cadmium exposure is associated with endometriosis among infertile Japanese women in a hospital-based case-control study .
We recruited consecutive female patients aged 20-45 years who had complained of infertility and presented to a university hospital in Tokyo .
The subjects were interviewed and provided a urine sample prior to a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis between January 2000 and December 2001 .
The severity of endometriosis was then dichotomized into controls ( stage 0 and I ) and cases ( stage II-IV ) .
We finally measured urinary total cadmium concentration in 54 cases and 74 controls as a biomarker of long-term cumulative exposure .
Odds ratios were adjusted for average menstrual cycle length , body-mass index and smoking status using unconditional logistic regression .
Results showed no association between endometriosis and urinary cadmium concentration .
Medians ( interquartile ranges ) of urinary cadmium concentration in cases and controls were 0.53 ( 0.40-0.73 ) and 0.54 ( 0.34-0.76 ) microg/g creatinine , respectively ( P for difference=0.88 ) .
Adjusted odds ratio ( 95% confidence interval ) for the highest versus lowest tertile of urinary creatinine-adjusted cadmium concentration was 0.86 ( 0.30 to 2.49 , P for trend=0.79 ) .
Our results do not support the hypothesis that higher urinary cadmium concentration is associated with the risk of endometriosis .
