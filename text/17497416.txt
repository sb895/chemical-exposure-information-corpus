This study determined the level of mercury , lead , and zinc in baby teeth of children with autism spectrum disorder ( n = 15 , age 6.1 +/- 2.2 yr ) and typically developing children ( n = 11 , age = 7 +/- 1.7 yr ) .
Children with autism had significantly ( 2.1-fold ) higher levels of mercury but similar levels of lead and similar levels of zinc .
Children with autism also had significantly higher usage of oral antibiotics during their first 12 mo of life , and possibly higher usage of oral antibiotics during their first 36 mo of life .
Baby teeth are a good measure of cumulative exposure to toxic metals during fetal development and early infancy , so this study suggests that children with autism had a higher body burden of mercury during fetal/infant development .
Antibiotic use is known to almost completely inhibit excretion of mercury in rats due to alteration of gut flora .
Thus , higher use of oral antibiotics in the children with autism may have reduced their ability to excrete mercury , and hence may partially explain the higher level in baby teeth .
Higher usage of oral antibiotics in infancy may also partially explain the high incidence of chronic gastrointestinal problems in individuals with autism .
