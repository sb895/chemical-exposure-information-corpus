In this study , the concentrations of 15 perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) were analyzed in 30 water samples collected in Catalonia ( Spain ) at three stages of the drinking water treatment process in several water purification plants .
In addition , the concentrations of 13 PFCs were determined in samples of fish and shellfish collected from coastal areas of Catalonia .
The intake of PFCs through both pathways , drinking water intake and fish and shellfish consumption , was also estimated .
In water samples , the highest mean concentrations corresponded to perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) ( 1.81 and 2.40 ng/L , respectively ) , whereas perfluorodecanosulfonate ( PFDS ) and perfluorotetradecanoic acid ( PFTDA ) were under their respective limits of detection in all analyzed samples .
The results show that although the current treatment processes caused slight reductions in PFC concentrations , these processes did not mean significant changes in the amounts of PFCs already contained in the raw water .
Among the analyzed PFCs in fish and shellfish , only seven compounds could be detected in at least one composite sample .
PFOS showed the highest mean concentration ( 2.70 ng/g fw ) , being detected in all species with the exception of mussels .
With regard to PFOA ( mean , 0.074 ng/g fw ) , the highest concentrations were detected in prawn and hake ( 0.098 and 0.091 ng/g fw , respectively ) .
The current exposure to PFCs through consumption of fish and shellfish indicates that it should not be of concern for the consumers .
The amounts ingested are well below the recommended tolerable daily intakes , at least for those PFCs for which information is available .
