An investigation of total arsenic in food composites , collected from the villagers , was carried out in arsenic-affected areas of the Murshidabad district , West Bengal where the agricultural system is mostly groundwater dependent .
The shallow , large-diameter tubewells installed for agricultural irrigation contain an appreciable amount of arsenic ( mean 0.085 mg/l , n=6 ) .
Even the soil is arsenic-contaminated ( mean 11.35 mg/kg , n=36 ) , so some arsenic can be expected in the food chain from crops cultivated in this area .
The results revealed that the individual food composite and food groups containing the highest mean arsenic concentrations ( microg/kg ) are potato skin ( 292.62 and 104 ) , leaf of vegetables ( 212.34 and 294.67 ) , arum leaf ( 331 and 341 ) , papaya ( 196.50 and 373 ) , rice ( 226.18 and 245.39 ) , wheat ( 7 and 362 ) , cumin ( 47.86 and 209.75 ) , turmeric powder ( 297.33 and 280.9 ) , cereals and bakery goods ( 156.37 and 294.47 ) , vegetables ( 91.73 and 123.22 ) , spices ( 92.22 and 207.60 ) and miscellaneous items ( 138.37 and 137.80 ) for the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively .
Arsenic is absorbed by the skin of most of the vegetables .
The arsenic concentration in fleshy vegetable material is low ( mean 2.72 microg/kg , n=45 ) .
Higher levels of arsenic were observed in cooked items compared with raw .
Daily dietary intakes of arsenic ( microg ) from the foodstuffs for adults are 171.20 and 189.13 and for children are 91.89 and 101.63 in the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively .
