The levels of 21 PBDE congeners were detemined in the dust sampled from 66 personal automobiles .
The dominant congener in automobile dust was BDE-209 with a median level of 8.12 \u03bcg g⁻¹ .
Personal vehicle dust samples contained the characteristic profile of the PBDE congeners that comprise the PentaBDE and DecaBDE commercial formulations .
Levels of PBDEs in personal automobiles are generally reduced in comparison to our previously reported levels in resale vehicles on dealership lots presumably due to a dilution effect introduced by dust or debris that does not originate from the vehicle .
Laboratory photochemical studies were conducted on both automobile dust collected from personal vehicles as well as BDE-209 adsorbed to sodium sulfate .
No significant degradation occurred in the personal vehicle dust after 56 days of constant UVA irradiation while significant degradation did occur with BDE-209 adsorbed to sodium sulfate .
PBDEs from the degradation of BDE-209 were identified and potential degradation pathways elucidated .
Human exposure potential to PBDEs from automobile dust ingestion remains a serious concern in the U.S. population .
