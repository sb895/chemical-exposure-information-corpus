Copper mining contributes to increased concentrations of metals in the environment , thereby increasing the risk of metals exposure to populations living in and around mining areas .
This study investigated environmental and toenail metals concentrations of non-occupational human exposure to metals in 39 copper-mining town residents and 47 non-mining town residents in Zambia .
Elevated environmental concentrations were found in samples collected from the mining town residents .
Toenail concentrations of cobalt ( GM 1.39 mg/kg ) , copper ( GM 132 mg/kg ) , lead ( 21.41 mg/kg ) selenium ( GM 0.38 mg/kg ) and zinc ( GM 113 mg/kg ) were significantly higher in the mining area and these metals have previously been associated with copper mining .
Residence in the mining area , drinking water , dust and soil metals concentrations were the most important contributors to toenail metals concentrations .
Further work is required to establish the specific pathways of exposure and the health risks of elevated metals concentrations in the copper mining area .
