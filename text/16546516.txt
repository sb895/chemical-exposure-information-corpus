This study evaluates background serum levels of selected organochlorine compounds among Japanese women of reproductive age and investigates whether lifestyle factors , especially dietary factors , may be associated with these levels .
A cross-sectional study was performed on 80 Japanese women , aged 26-43 years , who complained of infertility and were confirmed not to have endometriosis .
The serum levels of total toxic equivalency ( TEQ ) , 18 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs)/polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , 4 coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( cPCBs ) , 36 ortho-substituted polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and 13 chlorinated pesticides or their metabolites were measured and data were collected on the women's age , residence , occupation , body mass index ( BMI ) , smoking and alcohol habit and 6 dietary intakes ( fish , meats , rice , vegetables , fruits and dairy products ) .
The serum median level of total TEQ was 25.1 pg TEQ/g lipid , that of PCDDs/PCDFs/cPCBs was 11.5 pmol/g lipid , that of PCBs was 0.46 nmol/g lipid , and that of total pesticides was 1.32 nmol/g lipid .
The serum levels of total TEQ , PCDDs/PCDFs/cPCBs , PCBs and pesticides were positively associated with age ( P for trend=0.003 , 0.01 , 0.005 and 0.01 , respectively ) and frequent fish consumption ( P for trend=0.002 , 0.003 , 0.0003 and 0.006 , respectively ) .
Other lifestyle factors were not associated with serum organochlorine levels .
The present study suggests that Japanese women who consume fish frequently in their reproductive period tend to accumulate organochlorines in their bodies .
