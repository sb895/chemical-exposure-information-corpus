A previously developed and validated methodology based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry was used for determine the concentration levels of 14 perfluoroalkylated substances ( PFASs ) in a set of 48 breast milk samples collected from French women in the frame of the ELFE pilot study .
In accordance with other similar studies conducted at european and international levels , PFOS , PFOA , and PFHxS were detected and quantified in most of the analyzed samples ( 90% , 98% and 100% , respectively ) , and appeared as major contributors to the total PFAS exposure ( 38% , 37% , 25% , respectively ) , whereas the other targeted PFAS were very rarely , if not , found at the limits of detection of the method .
Also in agreement with other published data , the concentration levels measured for the detected substances varied from <0.05 to 0.33\u03bcg/L for PFOS ( median=0.079 ) , from <0.05 to 0.22\u03bcg/L for PFOA ( median=0.075 ) , and from 0.04 to 0.07\u03bcg/L for PFHxS ( median=0.050 ) .
On the basis of this relatively limited data set , no statistically significant relation was observed between these exposure levels and developmental outcomes , in particular the weight at birth .
Similarly , no relation was observed between the measured PFAS levels and various socio-demographical parameters including the consumption of seafood , alcohol , smoking , or socio-economical level .
These results suggest a need for further research and better knowledge regarding the sources , pharmacokinetics , and factors of exposure for other substances belonging to this class of emerging contaminants .
