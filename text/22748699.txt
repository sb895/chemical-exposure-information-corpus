Human biomonitoring is an important tool for the evaluation of environmental exposure to contaminants .
The data that are obtained from these studies might be compared to appropriate reference values ( RVs ) in a specific population .
The RVs were derived from the rounded values of the upper limit of the 95th confidence interval of the 95th percentile for lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) and mercury ( Hg ) in blood from adults in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo ( MASP ) , Brazil to investigate the association between blood metals and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors .
Blood samples from 653 nonsmoking blood donors without occupational exposure to the studied metals were collected in 2006 .
Our evaluations distinguished a younger group ( 18-39 years ) and an older group ( 40-65 years ) .
RVs in the younger group were 60 \u03bcgPb/L and 4 \u03bcgHg/L for men and 47 \u03bcgPb/L and 4 \u03bcgHg/L for women .
RVs in the older group were 80 \u03bcgPb/L and 5 \u03bcgHg/L for men and 63 \u03bcgPb/L and 6 \u03bcgHg/L for women .
The RV for Cd was 0.6 \u03bcg/L for adults aged 18-65 years .
Pb and Cd levels demonstrated a significant association with sex and age .
Male blood contained 50% more Pb , and the older group exhibited 23% more Pb .
Fish consumption and amalgam fillings were primarily related to Hg levels .
RVs for lead were similar to the Czech Republic and Germany but higher than the US population .
The RV for Cd in Brazil was well below the RVs of these countries .
The RVs for Hg in Brazil were similar to the US but higher than Germany and the Czech Republic .
