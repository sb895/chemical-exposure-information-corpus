Between January 2004 and June 2005 the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services recruited more than 2000 adults for a methylmercury ( MeHg ) exposure assessment study .
Study participants , including 978 men and 1050 women who ranged in age from 18 to 92 years , completed a fish consumption and advisory awareness survey and provided hair samples for mercury analysis .
Fish intake estimates ranged from 0 to 60 meals/month ( mean 7.7 ) .
Hair mercury levels ranged from 0.012 to 15.2 microg/g and were positively correlated with monthly fish meals .
Despite reporting similar fish consumption rates , men tended to have higher hair mercury levels than women .
Mercury levels exceeded 1 microg/g in 29% of the men and 13% of the women and increased with age .
Approximately , half of the study volunteers were licensed anglers and 77% were familiar with Wisconsin's sportfish consumption advisory .
Among consumers of sport-caught fish , 37% of the men and 18% of the women had a hair mercury concentration above 1 microg/g .
These findings suggest that exposure to MeHg is widespread and that men may be a previously unrecognized high risk population .
