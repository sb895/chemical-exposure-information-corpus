Scientific and public concern exists about potential reproductive health effects of persistent chlorinated organic chemicals , such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) , and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( DDE , the most stable daughter compound of DDT ) .
To explore the hypothesis that environmental exposures to PCBs and DDE are associated with altered semen parameters , we conducted a cross-sectional study of 212 male partners of subfertile couples who presented to the Massachusetts General Hospital Andrology Laboratory .
Semen parameters were analyzed as both a continuous measure and dichotomized based on World Health Organization reference values for sperm concentration ( < 20 million/mL ) , motility ( < 50% motile ) , and Kruger strict criteria for morphology ( < 4% normal ) .
The comparison group for the dichotomized analysis was men with all three semen parameters above the reference values .
In serum , 57 PCB congeners and p,p -DDE were measured by congener-specific analysis using gas chromatography with electron capture detection .
There were dose-response relationships among PCB-138 and sperm motility ( odds ratio per tertile , adjusted for age , abstinence , and smoking , and p-value for trend were , respectively , 1.00 , 1.68 , 2.35 , and p-value = 0.03 ) and morphology ( 1.00 , 1.36 , 2.53 , p-value = 0.04 ) .
There was limited evidence of an inverse relationship between sum of PCBs , as well as those PCBs classified as cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers , with sperm motility and sperm morphology , as well as limited evidence of an inverse association between p,p -DDE and sperm motility .
The lack of a consistent relationship among semen parameters and other individual PCB congeners and groupings of congeners may indicate a difference in spermatotoxicity between congeners .
