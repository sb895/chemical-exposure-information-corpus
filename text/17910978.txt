Enamel and dentine in teeth of children with high blood levels of lead were analyzed by means of secondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) and X-ray micro-analyses ( XRMA ) and compare with teeth from children with low blood levels of lead .
The SIMS analysis revealed detectable levels of Pb in dentine close to the pulp .
The XRMA analyses could not detect any lead .
There were no differences found in lead level in enamel of high lead level exposed teeth from low level exposed .
The results confirm that children with high blood levels of lead have an uptake of lead in dentine close to the pulp .
