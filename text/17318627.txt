A total of 2,402 cases of arsenic-related skin lesions ( as of 2002 ) in a few villages of China's Southwest Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture represent a unique case of endemic arseniasis related with indoor combustion of high arsenic coal .
A significant difference of skin lesion prevalence was observed between two clans of different ethnicities ( Hmong and Han ) in one of the hyperendemic villages in this prefecture .
This study was focused on a possible involvement of GST T1 and M1 polymorphisms in risk modulation of skin lesions and in the body burden of As in this unique case of As exposure .
GST T1 and M1 polymorphisms were genotyped by an allele-specific PCR-based procedure .
Total As contents in hair and urine samples as well as environmental samples of the homes of the two ethnic clans were analyzed .
No significant deviations in the population frequencies of GST T1 and M1 0/0 genotypes or their combination were recorded between diagnosed skin lesion patients and asymptomatic individuals in both clans .
Significantly higher As contents in hair and urine were observed in GSTM1 0/0 carriers , not in GSTT1 0/0 carriers .
After stratified by ethnicity and gender , a statistically significant association of the GSTM1 0/0 genotype and higher As content in hair was only confirmed in the subgroups of ethnic Han clan members and all male villagers , not in ethnic Hmong clan members or in females .
GST T1 and M1 homozygous deletions were not associated with an increased susceptibility to skin lesions in long-term exposure to indoor combustion of high As coal .
The polymorphic status at the locus of GSTM1 might modulate individual's body burden of total As in some Chinese ethnic groups .
