In this study , Arsenic ( As ) was measured in several varieties of imported and local cultivated rice .
Soil samples collected from rice farms situated in south Caspian Sea ( Iran ) were also studied .
The mean concentration of As in imported rice , local farmed rice and soil , were determined as 0.28 , 0.39 and 3.80\u03bcgg(-1) dry weight , respectively .
Estimated daily intake of As through human consumption of imported and local produced rice was 0.77 and 1.074\u03bcgday(-1) kg(-1) B.W. , respectively .
These values are much lower than the tolerable daily intakes estimated by JECFA .
The As concentration in the soil ( 3.80\u03bcgg(-1) dry ) was below acceptable limit for agricultural soil of 20.0mgkg(-1) as recommended by the European Community ( EC ) .
No correlation between the As concentrations in rice and soil samples was found ( p>0.05 ) .
