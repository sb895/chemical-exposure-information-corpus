Cross-sectional studies were conducted in three riverside communities in the state of Pará in the Amazon Region of Brazil .
Two of these communities , Brasília Legal and São Luís do Tapajós , are located in a watershed exposed to mercury pollution from artisanal gold mining , and the third , Santana do Ituqui , is outside this area .
The studies were based upon a community census and included all persons volunteering for participation in each community .
All participants were surveyed by questionnaire for health history , occupation , residence , and diet .
Clinical evaluations were also done on each subject , along with collection of blood , urine , feces , and hair .
Fish samples were collected to represent the most frequently consumed species .
Mercury was measured in hair and fish .
Although no signs or symptoms of overt mercury intoxication were observed , persons in Brasília Legal and São Luís do Tapajós had higher levels of mercury in hair than residents of Santana de Ituqui , located out of the risk area .
Levels of mercury in fish were below Brazilian health guidance limits , but the high rates of fish consumption among these populations raise concerns for the possible effects of chronic exposure , especially among young children and women of childbearing age .
