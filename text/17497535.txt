Formaldehyde , a natural component of all mammalian cells , is metabolized to carbon dioxide .
It is a colorless gas used as a preservative and a reactant in chemical processes in a wide variety of commercial and consumer products .
Toluene is an organic solvent also used in a wide variety of commercial and consumer products .
There is a growing concern that chemical exposure from consumer products including cosmetics adds to the overall toxic exposure bioburden .
This study was designed to quantify the actual amount of formaldehyde and toluene exposure to professional nail technicians and their customers during the application of cosmetic nail products containing either formaldehyde or toluene .
Formaldehyde concentrations were measured on workers and consumers using treated silica gel absorption tubes .
Formaldehyde concentrations varied between 0.0012 and 0.0038 ppm .
The results of this study clearly demonstrate that neither workers nor consumers are at any additional risk from exposure to formaldehyde or toluene in cosmetic nail products beyond daily exposure from commercial products in a work setting and in the home .
