Concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , 16 phthalate esters ( PAEs ) , eight organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) and seven polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in 17 frequently-consumed varieties of vegetables collected from 48 sites in Huizhou were measured .
Concentrations of PAHs and PAEs of leafy vegetables were higher than those of gourd and fruit vegetables but it was the opposite for OCPs and PCBs .
A questionnaire of 450 local residents on vegetable consumption showed that the total vegetable ingested rates of females and males were 278.80 g person(-1)d(-1) and 282.92 g person(-1)d(-1) , respectively .
The weight-specific daily intakes of pollutants by females were higher than those by males because of differences in body weight .
Twenty-seven pollutants were used to assess the potential risk to human health by calculating target hazard quotient ( THQ ) values .
Results showed that the risk to females was higher than for males .
OCPs were the major contributors to the risk for both females and males .
The main risks were from consumption of eggplant , Chinese lettuce and luffa and were significantly related to the contents of di-nonyl phthalate , \u03b2-hexachlorocyclohexane , \u03b3-hexachlorocyclohexane , p,p-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and p,p-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane in vegetables .
Although the THQ values induced by individual pollutants were relatively low , the total THQ values induced by 27 pollutants were above 1 in some administrative regions of Huizhou , which might give cause for concern .
