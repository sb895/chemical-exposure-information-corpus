Many studies have demonstrated mercury contamination in the Amazonian ecosystem , particularly in fish , a dietary mainstay of populations in this region .
The present study focused on potential health effects of this low-level methylmercury exposure .
The study was carried out in a village on the Tapaj√≥s River , a tributary of the Amazon , on 91 adults inhabitants ( 15-81 years ) , whose hair mercury levels were inferior to 50 mu/g .
Performance on a neurofunctional test battery and clinical manifestations of nervous system dysfunction were examined in relation to hair mercury concentrations .
Near visual contrast sensitivity and manual dexterity , adjusted for age , decreased significantly with hair mercury levels ( P < 0.05 ) , while there was a tendency for muscular fatigue to increase and muscular strength to decrease in women .
For the most part , clinical examinations were normal , however , hair mercury levels were significantly higher ( P < 0.05 ) for persons who presented disorganized movements on an alternating movement task and for persons with restricted visual fields .
These results suggest dose-dependent nervous system alterations at hair mercury levels below 50 micrograms/g , previously considered a threshold for clinical effects .
The profile of dysfunction in this adult population is consistent with the current knowledge on methyl-mercury poisoning .
The long-term implications of these findings are unknown and need to be addressed .
