Although arsenic contamination of groundwater has been detected recently in the Terai region of Nepal , scarce data have been available regarding the possible health effects of the contamination .
A study was carried out in two rural villages of Nawalparasi district , where the existence of arsenic contamination has been reported .
Almost all tubewells in one of the two villages ( Goini , G ) exceeded ( ranging from 0.104 mg/L to 1.702 mg/L ) the maximum permissible limit for arsenic in drinking water in Nepal ( 0.05 mg/L ) , and only a few tubewells ( 19.5% ) in the other village ( Kunuwar Big , KB ) were below this level ( 0.004 mg/L to 0.972 mg/L ) .
Prevalence rates of arsenicosis diagnosed on the basis of the presence of dermatological manifestations were 11.3% ( 56 out of 495 examined ) and 6.5% ( 34/525 ) in G and KB , respectively , with an overall prevalence rate of 8.9% .
In terms of gender , the prevalence rate was higher in males ( 11.5% ; 61/531 ) than in females ( 5.9% ; 29/489 ) , supporting previous observations including our own .
Most ( 71.1% ) of the identified patients were 20-49 years old , and the prevalence rate appeared to be higher among those in their 30s or 40s in the both sexes .
The youngest patient was 10 years of age .
All the patients were either in the mild or moderate stage of the disease and most ( 78.9% ) were in the mild stage .
Melanosis with some other manifestations was observed in 95.6% of the patients , while keratosis was found in 57.8% .
Leucomelanosis without any other manifestations , which has not been reported either in Bangladesh or India , was observed in 3.3% of the identified patients .
Only one patient had Bowen's disease .
To our knowledge , the current study provides for the first time quantitative information regarding the arsenicosis patients in Nepal .
