Synthetic musk compounds are used as additives in many consumer products , including perfumes , deodorants , and detergents .
Earlier studies have reported the occurrence of synthetic musks in environmental and wildlife samples collected in the United States .
In this study , human breast milk samples collected from Massachusetts , were analyzed for the determination of concentrations of synthetic musks such as musk xylene ( 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethyl-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene ) , musk ketone ( 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-dinitroacetophenone ) , HHCB ( 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[gamma]-2-benzopyran ) , AHTN ( 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene ) , and HHCB-lactone , the oxidation product of HHCB .
In addition , we estimated the daily intake of synthetic musks by infants based on the ingestion rate of breast milk .
Synthetic musks were found in most of the samples analyzed , and the concentrations ranged from < 2 to 150 ng musk xylene/g , < 2 to 238 ng musk ketone/ g , < 5 to 917 ng HHCB/g , < 5 to 144 ng AHTN/g , and < 10 to 88.0 ng HHCB-lactone/g , on a lipid weight basis .
The concentrations of HHCB were higher than the concentrations of other synthetic musks in breast milk samples .
The mean concentration of HHCB ( 220 ng/g , lipid weight ) was 5 times greater than the concentrations reported 10 years ago for breast milk samples collected in Germany and Denmark .
Maternal age was not correlated with the concentrations of musk xylene , musk ketone , HHCB , or AHTN .
There was a trend of decreasing concentrations of musk xylene , musk ketone , HHCB , and AHTN , with the number of children previously breast-fed , although the correlation was not significant .
Based on average daily ingestion rate of breast milk , an infant is estimated to ingest 297 +/- 229 ng musk xylene , 780 +/- 805 ng musk ketone , 1830 +/- 1170 ng HHCB , 565 +/- 614 ng AHTN , and 649 +/- 598 ng HHCB-lactone per day .
The ingestion rate of synthetic musks by infants in the United States is lower than that estimated for persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .
Based on the residue patterns and accumulation features , it can be concluded that the exposure characteristics for synthetic musks are different from those of POPs , and that the major source of exposure to synthetic musks is probably via dermal absorption or inhalation .
