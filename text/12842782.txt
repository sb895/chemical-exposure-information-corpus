Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are food-chain contaminants that have been shown to induce adverse developmental effects in humans .
In the course of an epidemiologic study established to investigate neurodevelopmental deficits induced by environmental PCB exposure in the Inuit population of northern Qu√©bec ( Nunavik , Canada ) , we compared three biomarkers of prenatal exposure and models to predict PCB plasma concentration at 6 months postpartum .
Concentrations of 14 PCB congeners were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection in lipids extracted from maternal plasma , cord plasma , breast milk ( collected at approximately 1 month postpartum ) , and 6-month-old infant plasma samples .
Similar congener profiles were observed in all biologic samples , and PCB-153 , the most abundant and persistent PCB congener , was strongly correlated with other frequently detected PCB congeners in all biologic media .
When expressed on a lipid basis , maternal plasma , cord plasma , and milk concentrations of this congener were strongly intercorrelated , indicating that PCB concentration in any of these biologic media is a good indicator of prenatal exposure to PCBs .
A multivariate model that included maternal PCB-153 plasma lipid concentration , breast-feeding duration , and the sum of two skin-fold thicknesses ( an index of infant body fat mass ) explained 72% of PCB-153 plasma concentration variance at 6 months postpartum ( p < 0.001 ) .
By contrast , based on the product of breast-feeding duration times the concentration of PCBs in plasma lipids , which was used as an index of postnatal PCB exposure in several studies , only 36% of infant plasma concentration was explained .
