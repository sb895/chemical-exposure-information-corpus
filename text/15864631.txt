OBJECTIVES External and internal exposure to naphthalene was examined in the most important industries that are typically concerned with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH)-induced diseases ( cancer ) .
Furthermore , a control collective from the general population was investigated .
METHODS External naphthalene was determined by personal air sampling ( n = 205 ) .
The internal exposure was examined by urinary metabolites 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol ( n = 277 ) .
RESULTS Highest median concentrations of naphthalene in air were found in converter infeed ( 93.2 microg/m3 ) and coal-tar distillation ( 35.8 microg/m3 ) .
Moderate and low levels were determined in coking plants ( 14.5 microg/m3 ) and in the production of refractories ( 6.1 microg/m3 ) and graphite electrodes ( 0.7 microg/m3 ) .
Biological monitoring revealed concentrations of the sum of both metabolites [ (1+2)-NOL ] in smokers to be increased by 1.6-6.4 times compared with that in non-smokers at the same workplaces .
Among non-smokers we found high median ( 1+2)-NOL levels in converter bricklayers ( 120.1 microg/l ) , in coal-tar distillation workers ( 56.0 microg/l ) and in coking plant workers ( 29.5 microg/l ) .
( 1+2)-NOL concentrations around 10 microg/l were found in the production of refractories and graphite electrodes .
There was a rough coherency between external and internal naphthalene exposure .
In the controls , median ( 1+2)-NOL concentrations were 10.9 microg/l in non-smokers ' urine and 40.3 microg/l in smokers ' urine samples .
CONCLUSIONS Actual conditions of occupational hygiene at the workplaces investigated in this comprehensive study are better than those that current limit values of 50,000 microg/m3 ( TLV , TRK ) seem to induce .
It has become obvious that tobacco smoking is a crucial confounding factor in biological monitoring of naphthalene-exposed humans , making interpretation of occupationally increased naphthol excretions very difficult at low exposure levels .
