This study was to explore the relationships between personal exposure to 10 volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) and biochemical liver tests with the application of canonical correlation analysis .
Data from a subsample of the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used .
Serum albumin , total bilirubin ( TB ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , and gamma-glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) served as the outcome variables .
Personal exposures to benzene , chloroform , ethylbenzene , tetrachloroethene , toluene , trichloroethene , o-xylene , m-,p-xylene , 1,4-dichlorobenzene , and methyl tert-butyl ether ( MTBE ) were assessed through the use of passive exposure monitors worn by study participants .
The first two canonical correlations were 0.3218 and 0.2575 , suggesting a positive correlation mainly between the six VOCs ( benzene , ethylbenzene , toluene , o-xylene , m-,p-xylene , and MTBE ) and the three biochemical liver tests ( albumin , ALP , and GGT ) and a positive correlation mainly between the two VOCs ( 1,4-dichlorobenzene and tetrachloroethene ) and the two biochemical liver tests ( LDH and TB ) .
Subsequent multiple linear regressions show that exposure to benzene , toluene , or MTBE was associated with serum albumin , while exposure to tetrachloroethene was associated with LDH and total bilirubin .
In conclusion , exposure to certain VOCs as a group or individually may influence certain biochemical liver test results in the general population .
