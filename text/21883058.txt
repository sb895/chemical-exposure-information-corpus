This cross-sectional study measures the arsenic level in school children exposed to contaminated well water in a rural area in MÃ©xico .
Arsenic was measured in hair by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometry .
Overall , 110 children were included ( average 10 years-old ) .
Among 55 exposed children , mean arsenic level on hair was 1.3 mg/kg ( range <0.006-5.9 ) .
All unexposed children had undetectable arsenic levels .
The high level of arsenic in water was associated to the level in hair .
However , exposed children drank less well water at school or at home than unexposed children , suggesting that the use of contaminated water to cook beans , broths or soups may be the source of arsenic exposure .
