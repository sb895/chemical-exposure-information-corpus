Studies were undertaken to assess the impact of wastewater/sludge disposal ( metals and pesticides ) from sewage treatment plants ( STPs ) in Jajmau , Kanpur ( 5 MLD ) and Dinapur , Varanasi ( 80 MLD ) , on health , agriculture and environmental quality in the receiving/application areas around Kanpur and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh , India .
The raw , treated and mixed treated urban wastewater samples were collected from the inlet and outlet points of the plants during peak ( morning and evening ) and non-peak ( noon ) hours .
The impact of the treated wastewater toxicants ( metals and pesticides ) on the environmental quality of the disposal area was assessed in terms of their levels in different media samples viz. , water , soil , crops , vegetation , and food grains .
The data generated show elevated levels of metals and pesticides in all the environmental media , suggesting a definite adverse impact on the environmental quality of the disposal area .
The critical levels of the heavy metals in the soil for agricultural crops are found to be much higher than those observed in the study areas receiving no effluents .
The sludge from the STPs has both positive and negative impacts on agriculture as it is loaded with high levels of toxic heavy metals and pesticides , but also enriched with several useful ingredients such as N , P , and K providing fertilizer values .
The sludge studied had cadmium , chromium and nickel levels above tolerable levels as prescribed for agricultural and lands application .
Bio-monitoring of the metals and pesticides levels in the human blood and urine of the different population groups under study areas was undertaken .
All the different approaches indicated a considerable risk and impact of heavy metals and pesticides on human health in the exposed areas receiving the wastewater from the STPs .
