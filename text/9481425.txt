We studied 308 female and 92 male textile workers employed in a factory that produced synthetic fiber hosiery .
The mean age of the women was 38 years , their mean duration of employment 16 years .
The mean age of the men was 39 years with a mean duration of employment of 16 years .
A control group of 160 female and 78 male nonexposed workers was also studied .
Chronic and acute work related symptoms were recorded for all workers .
Ventilatory capacity was measured by recording maximum expiratory flow-volume ( MEFV ) curves from which the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , the 1-sec forced expiratory volume ( FEV1 ) and maximum expiratory flow rates at 50% and the last 25% ( FEF50 , FEF75 ) were read .
There was a higher prevalence of all chronic respiratory symptoms in exposed than in control workers , although the differences were statistically significant only for dyspnea , sinusitis , and nasal catarrh ( P < 0.01 ) in female synthetic textile workers , and for nasal catarrh ( P < 0.01 ) in male synthetic textile workers .
Occupational asthma was recorded in 3 ( 0.9% ) of the women textile workers , and in 1 ( 1.1% ) of male textile workers .
There was a high prevalence of acute symptoms during the work shift , which was greatest for cough ( female : 46% ; male : 59% ) , dryness of the throat ( female : 49% ; male : 40% ) , dryness of the nose ( female : 53% ; male : 43% ) and eye irritation ( female : 46% ; male : 36% ) .
Ventilatory capacity data among the synthetic textile workers demonstrated significantly decreased FEF75 compared to predicted ( P < 0.05 ) .
Our data suggest that inhalation of dust in synthetic textile plants causes the respiratory impairment .
