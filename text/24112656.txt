The objective of this study was to estimate the levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs ) in blood serum obtained from non-occupationally exposed volunteers living in the Naples area ( Campania Region , southern Italy ) .
The samples were taken from two geographical zones : one was an urban area of Naples and its surroundings and the other was located in an area deemed to be at high environmental risk .
Total mean concentrations of these persistent pollutants proved to be in the range 1.43-17.38 pg WHO-TEQ1998 g(-1) lipid for PCDD/Fs , and 0.98-25.45 pg WHO-TEQ1998 g(-1) lipid for DL-PCBs .
NDL-PCBs were in the range 316.57-482.90 ng g(-1) lipid .
No significant differences were observed between women and men , nor between donors living in the two different areas .
The mean levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in the population living in the Naples area were lower than those observed in some studies of populations living in exposed areas ( near incineration plants or industrial sites ) and urban or rural areas .
