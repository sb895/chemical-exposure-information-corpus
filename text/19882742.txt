BACKGROUND The maintenance/repair of farm machinery is a common farming activity .
Dermal exposure to organic solvents has not been well documented .
A pilot study was conducted to characterize exposure to organic solvents .
METHODS A survey questionnaire was administered to 31 Kentucky farmers in 2008 .
Dermal exposure assessment was conducted in 10 farmers while farmers performed farm machinery maintenance/repair tasks using a solvent sampling patch .
Benzene , toluene , xylene , and n-hexane were analyzed .
RESULTS All four organic solvents were identified from the samples with toluene ( <0.5-36,000 microg/patch ) and xylene ( 15-5,700 microg/patch ) at significantly higher levels .
Twenty-six farmers reported the use of personal protective equipment <50% of their time repairing/maintaining farm machinery on the questionnaire ; only two farmers wore gloves during the exposure assessment .
CONCLUSIONS Farmers routinely use solvent products for farm machinery maintenance/repair .
Dermal exposure to organic solvents is a potential hazard .
Further studies to characterize and evaluate exposure in larger samples of farmers are needed .
