Mercury use in small-scale gold mining is ubiquitous across Ghana but little is known about the extent to which such activities have contaminated community residents and miners .
Here , occupational exposures to elemental mercury ( via urine sampling ) and dietary exposures to methylmercury ( via hair sampling ) were assessed among 120 participants recruited from a mining community located in the Talensi-Nabdam District of Ghana's Upper East region during summer 2009 .
More than one-fifth of the participants had moderately high levels of urinary mercury ( >10\u03bcg/L ) and 5% had urine mercury levels that exceeded the WHO guideline value of 50\u03bcg/L .
When participants were stratified according to occupation , those active in the mining industry had the highest mercury levels .
Specifically , individuals that burned amalgam had urine mercury levels ( median : 43.8\u03bcg/L ; mean ± SD : 171.1±296.5μg/L ; n=5 ) significantly higher than median values measured in mechanical operators ( 11.6\u03bcg/L , n=4 ) , concession managers/owners ( 5.6\u03bcg/L , n=11 ) , excavators that blast and chisel ore ( 4.9\u03bcg/L , n=33 ) , individuals that sift and grind crushed ore ( 2.2\u03bcg/L , n=47 ) , support workers ( 0.5\u03bcg/L , n=14 ) , and those with no role in the mining sector ( 2.5\u03bcg/L , n=6 ) .
There was a significant positive Spearman correlation between fish consumption and hair mercury levels ( r=0.30 ) but not with urine mercury ( r=0.18 ) though further studies are needed to document which types of fish are consumed as well as portion sizes .
Given that 200,000 people in Ghana are involved in the small-scale gold mining industry and that the numbers are expected to grow in Ghana and many other regions of the world , elucidating mercury exposure pathways in such communities is important to help shape policies and behaviors that may minimize health risks .
