A market basket survey was carried out with the aim to assess the levels of lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , copper ( Cu ) and zinc ( Zn ) in various fruits and vegetables sold in Egyptian markets .
Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to estimate and evaluate the levels of these metals .
The results of this survey showed that the average concentrations detected were ranged from 0.01 to 0.87 , 0.01 to 0.15 , 0.83 to 18.3 and 1.36 to 20.9 mg/kg for Pb , Cd , Cu and Zn , respectively .
The highest mean levels of Pb , Cd , Cu and Zn were detected in strawberries , cucumber , date and spinach , respectively .
The levels of the metals compare with those reported for similar fruits and vegetables from some other parts of the world .
The daily intakes of Pb , Cd , Cu and Zn through fruits and vegetables have also been estimated .
They are found to be below the recommended tolerable levels proposed by [ Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives 1999 .
