Consumption of fish containing methylmercury can pose serious health concerns including neurotoxic effects in adults and toxicity to the fetuses of mothers exposed during pregnancy .
In the study described in this article , the authors examined fish consumption patterns and measured hair mercury levels of women of childbearing age in a coastal county in Florida .
Women from the community participated in a risk factor assessment survey ( N = 703 ) .
Hair samples ( n = 698 ) were collected and analyzed for mercury .
The authors identified 74.8% below detection limit ; 25.2% had detectable limits of mercury , while 7% exceeded 1 pg/g .
Hair mercury levels increased with fish consumption and age .
Race , income , and education levels were also associated with increased hair mercury levels .
Women of Asian/Pacific Islander origin had the highest levels .
Although reported fish consumption exceeded the recommendations for women of childbearing age , the study population had lower mercury levels than other comparative studies in Florida and at national levels .
