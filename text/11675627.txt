BACKGROUND Migrant and seasonal farmworkers have a high potential for pesticide exposures , yet are rarely included in epidemiologic studies .
This study examined the feasibility of assessing prenatal exposures to pesticides and other compounds in pregnant Hispanic farmworkers .
METHODS Nine women completed a survey about work experiences during pregnancy .
Maternal urine , cord blood , and placenta samples were obtained at delivery for analysis of 51 analytes , including 6 phenoxy acid or triazine herbicides , 21 organochlorine insecticides , 10 PCBs , and 14 volatile organic compounds .
RESULTS Seven of 51 analytes were found in the biological samples .
DDE , DDT , dichlorbenzene , toluene , trimethylbenzene , and endosulfan sulfate were detected in cord blood samples , and 2,4-D in urine from one or more women .
CONCLUSIONS We documented the feasibility of following farmworkers to assess in utero exposure to pesticides and other contaminants , and demonstrated exposure to these compounds .
Difficulties in measuring pesticides with short half lives were noted .
