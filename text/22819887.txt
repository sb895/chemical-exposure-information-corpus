Arsenic is a toxic metal with harmful effects on human health , particularly on cognitive function .
Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASDs ) are lifelong neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders manifesting in infancy or early childhood .
We used data from 130 children between 2 and 8 years ( 65 pairs of ASD cases with age- and sex-matched control ) , to compare the mean total blood arsenic concentrations in children with and without ASDs in Kingston , Jamaica .
Based on univariable analysis , we observed a significant difference between ASD cases and controls ( 4.03 \u03bcg/L for cases vs. 4.48 \u03bcg/L for controls , P<0.01 ) .
In the final multivariable General Linear Model ( GLM ) , after controlling for car ownership , maternal age , parental education levels , source of drinking water , consumption of " yam , sweet potato , or dasheen " , " carrot or pumpkin " , " callaloo , broccoli , or pak choi " , cabbage , avocado , and the frequency of seafood consumption per week , we did not find a significant association between blood arsenic concentrations and ASD status ( 4.36 \u03bcg/L for cases vs. 4.65 \u03bcg/L for controls , P=0.23 ) .
Likewise , in a separate final multivariable GLM , we found that source of drinking water , eating avocado , and eating " callaloo , broccoli , or pak choi " was significantly associated with higher blood arsenic concentrations ( all three P<0.05 ) .
Based on our findings , we recommend assessment of arsenic levels in water , fruits , and vegetables , as well as increased awareness among the Jamaican population regarding potential risks for various exposures to arsenic .
