We collected indoor air , surface wipes ( floors , table tops , and window sills ) , and floor dust samples at multiple locations within 11 occupied and two unoccupied homes both before and after lawn application of the herbicide 2,4-D .
We measured residues 1 week before and after application .
We used collected samples to determine transport routes of 2,4-D from the lawn into the homes , its subsequent distribution between the indoor surfaces , and air concentration as a function of airborne particle size .
We used residue measurements to estimate potential exposures within these homes .
After lawn application , 2,4-D was detected in indoor air and on all surfaces throughout all homes .
Track-in by an active dog and by the homeowner applicator were the most significant factors for intrusion .
Resuspension of floor dust was the major source of 2,4-D in indoor air , with highest levels of 2,4-D found in the particle size range of 2.5-10 microm .
Resuspended floor dust was also a major source of 2,4-D on tables and window sills .
Estimated postapplication indoor exposure levels for young children from nondietary ingestion may be 1-10 microg/day from contact with floors , and 0.2-30 microg/day from contact with table tops .
These are estimated to be about 10 times higher than the preapplication exposures .
By comparison , dietary ingestion of 2,4-D is approximately 1.3 microg/day .
