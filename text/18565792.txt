Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) can currently be detected in many environmental media and biota , as well as in humans .
Because of their persistence and their potential to accumulate they are of toxicological concern .
The present review presents the current knowledge of PFC monitoring data in environmental media relevant for human exposure .
In this context , PFC concentrations in indoor and ambient air , house dust , drinking water and food are outlined .
Furthermore , we summarize human biomonitoring data of PFC levels in blood , breast milk , and human tissues .
An estimate of the overall exposure of the general adult population is provided and compared with tolerable intake values .
Using a simplified model , the average ( and upper ) level of daily exposure including all potential routes amounts to 1.6 ng/kg(body weight ) ( 8.8 ng/kg(body weight) ) for PFOS and 2.9 ng/kg(body weight ) ( 12.6 ng/kg(body weight) ) for PFOA in adults in the general population .
The majority of exposure can be attributed to the oral route , mainly to diet .
Overall , the contribution of PFOS and PFOA precursors to total exposure seems to be limited .
Besides this background exposure of the general population , a specific additional exposure may occur which causes an increased PFC body burden .
This has been observed in populations living near PFC production facilities or in areas with environmental contamination of PFCs .
The consumption of highly contaminated fish products may also cause an increase in PFC body burdens .
