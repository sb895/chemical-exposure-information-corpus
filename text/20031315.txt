Epidemiologic studies suggest that zinc ( Zn ) deficiency and high accumulation of cadmium ( Cd ) may be associated with increased risk of cancer .
The incidence of mouth cancer has increased among females , who possess habits of chewing tobacco with gradients ( areca nut and betel quid ) and smoking tobacco in Pakistan .
In present study , we measured the concentration of Cd and Zn in 96 mouth cancer patients ( MCPs ) and 110 female controls/referents ( 67 smoker and chewing tobacco ) , while 43 have none of smoking and chewing tobacco habits , belongs to different cities of Pakistan .
Both controls and patients have same age group ( ranged 35-65 years ) , socio-economic status , localities and dietary habits .
The Zn and Cd were determined by flame/graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer , prior to microwave assisted acid digestion method .
The Cd/Zn ratio in both biological samples was also calculated .
The results of this study showed that the mean value of Zn was lower , while the mean concentration of Cd was higher in the blood and scalp hair samples of MCPs as compared to control subjects ( p<0.001 ) .
The controls chewing and smoking tobacco have high level of Cd in both biological samples as compared to those have not smoking or chewing tobacco ( p<0.012 ) .
The Cd/Zn ratio was higher in MCPs than control subjects .
This study is compelling evidence in support of positive associations between cadmium , cigarette smoking , deficiency of Zn and cancer risk .
