Mercury concentrations were determined in scalp hair of 233 school children aged 6-16 years .
The study was carried out in three communities ( Flix , Tarragona and Tortosa ) from Tarragona Province ( Southern Catalonia , Spain ) .
The influence of the variables place of residence , age , sex , fish and seafood consumption , number of dental amalgam fillings , hair color , parents ' occupation , and smoking habits of the household members was also examined .
The geometric mean mercury concentration in hair was 0.77 microgram/g .
The place of residence , sex , and the frequency in consuming fish and seafood were the variables that significantly affected hair mercury concentrations .
Girls had more mercury in their hair than boys , whereas hair mercury levels were significantly correlated with the frequency in the fish and seafood consumption , with the levels being more elevated when the fish and seafood consumption was also higher .
Hair mercury concentrations were also affected by the place of residence , with school children of Flix showing lower mercury concentrations than those found in children from Tarragona and Tortosa .
The remaining variables had no influence on hair mercury levels .
