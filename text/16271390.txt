From 1975 to 2004 , a municipal solid waste incinerator ( MSWI ) was operating in Montcada ( Barcelona , Catalonia , Spain ) .
Because of the potential health risks derived from emission of pollutants by the facility , especially polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) and dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , a long-term monitoring program focused on measuring the environmental levels of PCDD/Fs near the facility , and to assess the health risks for the population living in the neighborhood , was established between 1996 and 2002 .
A total number of 111 soil and 121 herbage samples were analyzed for PCDD/Fs during this period .
Human health risks for the individuals living near the MSWI ( 500 and 1,000 m ) were also assessed before ( 1998 ) and after modernization ( 2000 ) of the facility .
It included PCDD/F inhalation , dermal contact , soil and dust ingestion , and food intake .
All these data are here summarized .
The environmental levels of PCDD/Fs showed that the MSWI was not the main responsible of the atmospheric pollution by these compounds .
In turn , human health risks for the population living in the vicinity of the facility after introduction of a modern technology were negligible in comparison with the dietary PCDD/F exposure .
