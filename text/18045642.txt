Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and hydroxylated PCBs ( OH-PCBs ) were investigated in human adipose tissue samples collected from 20 women undergoing surgery .
Mean sum of PCB and sum of OH-PCB levels were 737ng/g of lipid and 8pg/g of lipid , respectively .
Among PCBs , congeners 180 , 153 , 138 and 170 were the most frequent and abundant , and together constituted 72% of the total amount of PCBs in adipose tissue .
The PCB congener pattern and the frequencies and concentrations of non-dioxin-like and non-hydroxylated congeners observed in adipose tissue were similar in distribution and order of magnitude to the profile previously published in Spain but lower than that found in other European countries .
Among OH-PCB congeners studied , 4-OH-PCB 107/118 was found at the highest concentrations followed by 3'-OH-PCB 180 and 3-OH-PCB 138 .
To date , no information on levels of PCB metabolites in the Spanish population is available for comparison .
These three predominant OH-PCBs contributed 97% of all OH-PCBs .
Twelve dioxin-like PCBs contributed around 8% of the total PCB exposure , and all were present in all study subjects .
Further research is required to determine trends in human exposure to PCBs and OH-PCBs and how existing banning measures affect exposure .
