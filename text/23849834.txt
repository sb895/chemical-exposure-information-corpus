Synthetic musks ( SMs ) have been widely used as fragrance ingredients in personal care and sanitary commodities .
Due to their high volatility and particle-binding affinity , the indoor dust is a major reservoir of SMs , and dust ingestion could be an important exposure way to special populations , such as hairdressers .
In spite of the known toxicity of SMs , there is no information regarding the occurrence of SMs in barbershop dusts and the exposure of hairdressers through indoor dust ingestion .
In the present study , the levels of two nitro musks and five polycyclic musks were measured from indoor dust samples collected from barbershops , and some other indoor dust samples were also collected from dormitories , bathhouses and households for comparison .
The concentrations of \u2211SMs in barbershop dusts were 10-100 times higher than those from the other three indoor microenvironments .
Polycyclic musks accounted for 89.4% of \u2211SMs on average in all samples , of which two compounds , HHCB and AHTN jointly dominated 97.9% of polycyclic musks .
The levels of HHCB and AHTN varied from 12.2 to 8.39×10(5) and from 13.2 to 3.49×10(5) ng g(-1) , respectively .
The daily intakes ( DIs ) of \u2211SMs through house dust ingestion were estimated using the model of high dust ingestion and worst-case exposure ( P95 ) , and the corresponding exposure rates were 2791 , 135 and 727 ng d(-1) for the hairdressers , general population and toddlers .
SMs were also detected in blood samples collected from the hairdressers and normal adults ( n=50 and 10 , respectively ) .
There was no significant difference between these two groups .
Despite the absence of higher SM concentrations in hairdresser's blood , we should not overlook the potential occupational health risks due to their high SMs ingestion rate .
