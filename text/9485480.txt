Environmental pollution with the nephrotoxic metal cadmium is considered a potential health risk for the general population .
In 1976 it was reported that the cadmium concentration in human kidney cortex in Sweden had increased in parallel with increasing levels in soil and grain during the twentieth century .
Since the cadmium concentration in farming lands is still increasing , the present study was undertaken to further elucidate whether the cadmium concentration in the kidney is still increasing .
Kidney cortex biopsies were collected at 171 autopsies of victims to sudden and accidental death during 1995 and 1996 , and the cadmium concentrations were determined and compared with previously published Swedish data obtained from forensic autopsies .
The geometric mean cadmium concentration in kidney cortex in subjects 40 years of age and younger was about 40% of the concentration found in the 1970s , while the reduction was less pronounced among older people .
The highest individual concentration of cadmium was 41.5 microg/g wet weight ( ww ) .
The geometric mean concentration was less than 14 microg/g ww at ages around 50 years of age , when the cadmium concentration in kidney cortex is highest , as compared with approximately 20 microg/g ww in the 1970s .
There was also a reduction in cadmium concentrations among nonsmokers ; thus , a decrease in tobacco smoking in Sweden during the last decades is not the only explanation for the reduction of cadmium in the kidney cortex .
Other reasons for this reduction could be changes in dietary habits and reduced cadmium contamination from Swedish industries .
