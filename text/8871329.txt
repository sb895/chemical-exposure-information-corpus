Contamination of drinking water with petroleum products is an increasingly common problem .
Physicians are often asked to advise patients about such exposures .
This study assessed household exposure from gasoline-contaminated drinking water in a New England household .
A sampling strategy was designed to estimate inhalation and ingestion exposure to benzene and three other aromatic hydrocarbons typically found in gasoline-contaminated water .
The estimated inhaled doses of all agents were similar to the estimated ingested dose .
Over half the inhaled dose of all four agents was associated with shower activities as was over half the estimated total dose by all routes of exposure .
Under these conditions , discontinuing ingestion of water contaminated with these agents may decrease the dose of benzene by less than one third , whereas discontinuing both ingestion and showering may decrease the dose of benzene by over three quarters .
This limited study suggests that routes of exposure other than ingestion are important and should receive attention in the regulatory and risk-assessment process .
