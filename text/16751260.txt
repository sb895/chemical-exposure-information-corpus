Ambient levels of particulate matter have been linked to cardiovascular disease .
The mechanisms mediating these associations are poorly understood .
One candidate mechanism is inflammation .
Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( 2000-2002 ) , the authors investigated the relation between exposure to particulate matter of less than or equal to 2.5 microm in diameter ( PM2.5 ) and C-reactive protein concentration in 5,634 persons aged 45-84 years who were free of cardiovascular disease .
Data from US Environmental Protection Agency monitors were used to estimate PM2.5 exposures for the prior day , prior 2 days , prior week , prior 30 days , and prior 60 days .
Only the 30-day and 60-day mean exposures showed a weak positive association with C-reactive protein , and confidence intervals were wide : relative increases in C-reactive protein per 10 microg/m3 of PM2.5 adjusted for person-level covariates were 3% ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : -2 , 10 ) for a 30-day mean and 4% ( 95% CI : -3 , 11.0 ) for a 60-day mean .
The means of 7-day , 30-day , and 60-day exposures were weakly , positively , and nonsignificantly associated with the odds of C-reactive protein of greater than or equal to 3 mg/liter : adjusted odds ratios were 1.05 ( 95% CI : 0.96 , 1.15 ) , 1.12 ( 95% CI : 0.98 , 1.29 ) , and 1.12 ( 95% CI : 0.96 , 1.32 ) , respectively .
Slightly stronger associations were observed in persons without other risk factors for elevated C-reactive protein , but this heterogeneity was not statistically significant .
The authors ' results are not compatible with strong effects of particulate matter exposures on population levels of C-reactive protein .
