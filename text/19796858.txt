Prior to this study , reports of occurrence of polycyclic musks and polychlorinated naphthalenes ( PCNs ) in human tissues from Italy were not available .
In this study , concentrations of PCNs and polycyclic musks were determined in human adipose tissue from Italy collected during 2005-2006 ; for comparison , legacy organohalogen pollutants such as organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) were determined .
SigmaPCN concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 14 ng/g lipid wt ( lw ) .
Polycyclic musks such as HHCB and AHTN were found in 92% and 83% of the human samples , respectively .
Concentrations of PBDEs in Italian adipose tissue ranged between 3.2 and 35.6 ng/g lw .
