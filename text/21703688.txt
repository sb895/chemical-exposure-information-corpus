The impact of cigarette smoking on volatile organic compound ( VOC ) blood levels is studied using 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) data .
Cigarette smoke exposure is shown to be a predominant source of benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , xylenes and styrene ( BTEXS ) measured in blood as determined by ( 1 ) differences in central tendency and interquartile VOC blood levels between daily smokers [ \u22651 cigarette per day ( CPD) ] and less-than-daily smokers , ( 2 ) correlation among BTEXS and the 2,5-dimethylfuran ( 2,5-DMF ) smoking biomarker in the blood of daily smokers , and ( 3 ) regression modeling of BTEXS blood levels versus categorized CPD .
Smoking status was determined by 2,5-DMF blood level using a cutpoint of 0.014 ng/ml estimated by regression modeling of the weighted data and confirmed with receiver operator curve ( ROC ) analysis .
The BTEXS blood levels among daily smokers were moderately-to-strongly correlated with 2,5-DMF blood levels ( correlation coefficient , r , ranging from 0.46 to 0.92 ) .
Linear regression of the geometric mean BTEXS blood levels versus categorized CPD showed clear dose-response relationship ( correlation of determination , R(2) , ranging from 0.81 to 0.98 ) .
Furthermore , the pattern of VOCs in blood of smokers is similar to that reported in mainstream cigarette smoke .
These results show that cigarette smoking is a primary source of benzene , toluene and styrene and an important source of ethylbenzene and xylene exposure for the U.S. population , as well as the necessity of determining smoking status and factors affecting dose ( e.g. , CPD , time since last cigarette ) in assessments involving BTEXS exposure .
