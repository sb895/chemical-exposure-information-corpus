In a previous study , we speculated that some of the high mercury levels observed in head hair from a total of 14 subjects who resided around Lake Victoria , Tanzania , might be attributable to the habitual use of toilet soap containing considerable amounts of mercury ( Harada et al .
Sci Total Environ 1999;227:249-256 ) .
In August 1998 , the current study was conducted to investigate if such mercury-containing soap was also available in the surroundings of Lake Victoria , Kenya , and if so , its toxic effects .
A total of nine goldminers , 44 fishermen and their families , and 12 residents of Kisumu City , Kenya , volunteered for the study .
Fourteen types of toilet soap were collected in Kisumu .
Total mercury content was very significantly higher than in European-made soap ( 0.47-1.7% , as mercury iodide ) compared with Kenya-made soap ( 0.41 x 10(-4)-6.2 x 10(-4)% ) .
Indeed , all the subjects with a high hair mercury level ( > 36.1 ppm ) had made habitual use of European-made soap , accompanied by various symptoms , such as tremor , lassitude , vertigo , neurosthenia , and black and white blots , suggesting inorganic-mercury poisoning .
On the other hand , any subject who had used soap other than the European-made soap , did not exceed a mercury level of 10 ppm in hair that is well within normal limits ( Harada et al .
Sci Total Environ 1999:227:249-256 ) .
The findings obtained suggest that the mercury-containing soap must be barred from circulation without delay , and that the residents ' health in addition to the environmental pollution in Lake Victoria ( Kenya as well as Tanzania ) should be kept under close observation .
