OBJECTIVE To investigate the difference of arsenic metabolism in populations with long-term high arsenic exposure and explore the relationship between arsenic metabolism diversity and skin lesion .
METHODS 327 residents in an arsenic polluted village were voluntarily enrolled in this study .
Questionnaire survey and medical examination were carried out to learn basic information and detect skin lesions .
Urinary inorganic and methylated arsenic were speciated by high performance liquid chromatography combined with hydride-generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry .
Total arsenic concentration in hair was determined with DDC-Ag method .
RESULTS Hair arsenic content of studied polutions was generally high , but no significant difference were found among the studied four groups .
MMA and DMA concentration in urine increased with studied polution age , and were positively related with skin lesion grade .
The relative proportion of MMA in serious skin lesion group was significantly higher than in other 3 groups , while DMA/MMA ratio was significantly lower than control and mild group .
The relative proportion of MMA was positively related with skin lesion grade , DMA/ MMA ratio was negatively related with skin lesion grade .
Males could have higher arsenic cumulation and lower methylation capacity than those of females .
The population of above 40 years old may have higher methylation capacity than those of adults below 40yeas old .
Smokers and drinkers seemed lower methylation capacity than those of non-smokers and non-drinkers respectively .
CONCLUSION The methylation of arsenic could affect by several factors , including age gender , smoking and drinking .
Arsenic methylation copacity mey be associated with skin lesion induced by arsenic exposure .
