The objective of this study is to investigate the potential effect of maternal environmental cadmium ( Cd ) exposure on birth weight and fetal growth restriction ( FGR ) .
A total of 901 pregnant women from the EDEN cohort study were enrolled from two maternity units .
Blood Cd was measured at mid-pregnancy and associations with birth weight and FGR were analyzed .
Maternal Cd levels were associated with reduced birth weight in the offspring of women who smoked during pregnancy ( b=-113.7 ; p=0.001 ) .
Smoking during pregnancy and maternal blood Cd concentrations had comparable effects on FGR incidence ( OR 1.89 ; 95% CI : 1.00-3.58 and OR=1.41 ; 95% CI : 1.00-1.99 , respectively ) .
This study highlights the effect of Cd toxicity on fetal growth through the probable accumulation and transmission of this metal through the placenta .
The close relationship between blood Cd levels and smoking habits indicates that Cd may be a relevant biomarker for smoking toxicity on fetal development .
