To determine the genotoxic risk associated to environmental arsenic exposure , the frequency of micronuclei in buccal cells ( BCMN ) of people drinking arsenic-contaminated water has been evaluated .
A group of 105 individuals from the Antofagasta region ( north Chile ) , and 102 individuals from the area of Concepcion , used as reference group , were included in the study .
Arsenic concentration in drinking water was high ( 0.75 mg/L ) in the Antofagasta area , 75-fold the maximum recommended level by WHO ( 0.01 mg/L ) , while the values obtained in Concepcion were significantly lower ( 0.002 mg/L ) .
Individual measures of arsenic exposure were also determined in fingernails , which clearly confirm the existence of chronic exposure in the sampled populations from the Antofagasta region ( 10.15 microg/g versus 3.57 microg/g ) .
The cytogenetic results indicate that , although the BCMN frequency is higher in exposed than in controls , this increase does not attain statistical significance .
When the exposure biomarkers were related with the cytogenetic values , no correlations were observed between BCMN and arsenic content in water or in fingernails .
In addition , the genotoxicity values do not seem to be related to the ethnic origin from people belonging to the exposed group .
As a conclusion it appears that , in the studied population , the chronic ingestion of arsenic-contaminated water does not induce cytogenetic damage , measured as micronuclei , in the cells of the oral mucous in a significant extent .
