Brominated flame retardants are components of many plastics and are used in products such as cars , textiles , televisions , and personal computers .
Human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE ) flame retardants has increased exponentially during the last three decades .
Our objective was to measure the body burden and distribution of PBDEs and to determine the concentrations of the predominant PBDE congeners in samples of liver , bile , adipose tissue , and blood obtained from Japanese autopsy cases .
Tissues and body fluids obtained from 20 autopsy cases were analyzed .
The levels of 25 PBDE congeners , ranging from tri- to hexa-BDEs , were assessed .
The geometric means of the sum of the concentrations of PBDE congeners having detection frequencies >50 % ( \u03a3PBDE ) in the blood , liver , bile , and adipose tissue were 2.4 , 2.6 , 1.4 , and 4.3 ng/g lipid , respectively .
The most abundant congeners were BDE-47 and BDE-153 , followed by BDE-100 , BDE-99 , and BDE-28+33 .
These concentrations of PBDE congeners were similar to other reports of human exposure in Japan but were notably lower than concentrations than those reported in the USA .
Significant positive correlations were observed between the concentrations of predominant congeners and \u03a3PBDE among the samples analyzed .
The \u03a3PBDE concentration was highest in the adipose tissue , but PBDEs were distributed widely among the tissues and body fluids analyzed .
The PBDE levels observed in the present study are similar to those reported in previous studies in Japan and significantly lower than those reported in the USA .
