BACKGROUND Phthalates are prevalent environmental exposure chemicals with rising concern on various health effects , including pulmonary function .
Meanwhile , elderly people are more susceptible to environmental exposure , and their decreasing lung function is an important health issue .
OBJECTIVES To investigate the association between urinary phthalate metabolite levels and indices for pulmonary function , and evaluate effect modification by genetic polymorphisms of oxidative-stress related genes , catalase ( CAT ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD2 ) , and myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) in elderly Koreans .
METHODS We conducted a panel study on 418 individuals over 60 years old in Seoul , Korea , and repeatedly measured urinary phthalate metabolite levels and ran pulmonary function tests .
Genetic polymorphisms of CAT ( rs769218 , rs769217 ) , SOD2 ( rs4880 , rs2758331 , rs5746136 ) and MPO ( rs2071409 , rs7208693 ) were determined .
Mixed effect model was used to investigate association of phthalate levels with pulmonary function indices and to examine the effect of CAT , SOD2 and MPO polymorphisms on the association .
RESULTS Inverse association was demonstrated between sum of mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate ( \u2211DEHP ) levels and FEV1/FVC ( \u03b2=-0.632 , p=0.0275 ) or FEF25-75 ( \u03b2=-0.077 , p=0.025 ) after adjusting for age , months after previous measurements , sex , body mass index , cotinine , mean temperature and dew point .
The effect of \u2211DEHP on lung function was significant only in subjects with certain genotypes , and having all significant genotypes in three genes showed significant difference in the phthalate-pulmonary function association ( FEV1/FVC : \u03b2=-2.169 , p=0.0032 ; FEF25-75 : \u03b2=-0.155 , p=0.0103 ) , while other combinations showed less estimate size without any significance .
CONCLUSIONS Urinary phthalate metabolites levels are associated with decreasing pulmonary function in elderly Koreans , and effect modification of certain CAT , SOD2 and MPO polymorphisms on the association is suggested .
