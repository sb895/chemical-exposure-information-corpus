Analysis of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , 20 organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) and 18 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were performed on eggs from three different production types ( conventional , free-run and organic ) collected from the markets of the Canary Islands ( Spain ) .
Unlike other studies we did not found differences in the content of PCBs or OCPs of eggs in relation to its production type .
Median \u2211OCPs content was 3.87 ng g⁻¹ fat , being dieldrin , dicofol , hexachlorobenzene , p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT the most frequently detected .
Median \u2211PCBs value was 3.93 ng g⁻¹ fat , with 79.9% of this amount coming from the marker PCBs .
Two samples , one free-run and one organic , greatly exceeded the current European Commission ( EC ) limit of 2.5 pg TEQ(PCDD/F) g⁻¹ lipid , but the rest were well below of this limit .
The concentrations of PAHs in conventionally produced eggs were almost 4 times higher than in free-run or organic eggs .
Mean dietary intake estimates of the organochlorine contaminants based on consumption of eggs , regardless of the type chosen , is negligible for the Canary Islands ' population .
However , the median dietary intake estimates of PAHs greatly depend on the type of eggs chosen , being much lower when free-run and organic eggs are consumed .
