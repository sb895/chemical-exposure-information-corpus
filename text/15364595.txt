Environmental measurements of organophosphorus ( OP ) pesticides were conducted in the homes of 13 children , who lived either in the Seattle metropolitan area or in the agricultural region of Washington State , to ascertain exposure through multiple pathways .
Each home was sampled for two 24-h periods during two seasons , summer and fall .
Samples included 24-h indoor air , drinking water , soil , house dust , and hand and toy wipes and 24-h duplicate diets .
At least one OP pesticide was found in each of the matrices sampled except for drinking water .
Half of the indoor air samples contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos or diazinon .
Detectable levels of diazinon and azinphosmethyl in house dust were found in most of the agricultural homes , whereas only diazinon was found in the Seattle homes in the summer .
Quantifiable chlorpyrifos and azinphosmethyl were found on either agricultural children's hands or their toys .
These findings suggest different exposure pathways for children living in agricultural and nonagricultural regions .
