We have studied hepatic function in individuals chronically exposed to arsenic ( As ) via drinking water in Region Lagunera , Mexico .
We studied 51 individuals living in three villages exposed to As in water .
Nazareno ( 0.014 mgAs/l ) , Santa Ana ( 0.1 mgAs/l ) and Benito Ju√°rez ( 0.3 mgAs/l ) .
We determined the serum activity of aspartate aminotransferase ( SAT ) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) as indicators of hepatocellular injury and that of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase ( GGT ) and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) as indicators of cholestasic injury .
Serum bilirubin was used as an indicator of organic conjugated anion transport .
Total proteins , albumin and globulin fraction in serum were used as indicators of biosynthetic liver capacity .
The main findings of this study were the predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and increased serum ALP activity which were related to the concentration of total arsenic ( TAs ) in urine , suggesting the presence of cholestasis in As-exposed individuals .
No significant changes were observed in the other parameters studied .
