Highly toxic organochlorine chemicals such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( CoPCBs ) were determined in the peripheral blood and sebum from the face of 16 " Yusho " patients of about 27 yr after the outbreak of Yusho accident , and 39 healthy Japanese people .
The mean total toxic equivalent ( TEQ ) levels of PCDDs , PCDFs and CoPCBs in the blood were still about seven times higher in Yusho patients than in healthy Japanese at the age of 45 yr and more .
The sebum excretion of these chemicals seemed proportional to their blood levels in Yusho patients .
These toxic chemicals , however , did not enhance frequencies of sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) in the control and 7,8-benzoflavone ( ANF ) treated cultures in Yusho patients .
Hence , no significant difference was observed in the mean SCE rates between the Yusho patients and general Japanese people of more than 45 yr of age .
In this study , the number of Yusho patients examined is limited , so further large-scale investigations are needed to get more conclusive results concerning the genotoxic potency such as SCE induction .
