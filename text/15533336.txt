Following an official recommendation in the Faroe Islands that women should abstain from eating mercury-contaminated pilot whale meat , a survey was carried out to obtain information on dietary habits and hair samples for mercury analysis .
A letter was sent to all 1180 women aged 26-30 years who resided within the Faroes , and the women were contacted again 1 year later .
A total of 415 women responded to the first letter ; the second letter resulted in 145 repeat hair samples and 125 new responses .
Questionnaire results showed that Faroese women , on average , consumed whale meat for dinner only once every second month , but the frequency and meal size depended on the availability of whale in the community .
The geometric mean hair-mercury concentration at the first survey was higher in districts with available whale than in those without ( 3.03 vs. 1.88 microg/g ; P=0.001 ) .
The mercury concentration also depended on the frequency of whale meat dinners and on the consumption of dried whale meat .
The 36 women who did not eat whale meat at all had a geometric mean hair-mercury concentration of 1.28 microg/g .
At the time of the second survey , the geometric mean had decreased to 1.77 microg/g ( P<0.001 ) , although whale was now available in all districts .
In comparison with previously published data on hair-mercury concentrations in pregnant Faroese women , these results document substantially lower exposures as well as a further decrease temporally associated with the issue of a stricter dietary advisory .
