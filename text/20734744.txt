The authors have studied the environmental distribution of salts of heavy metals ( cadmium and nickel ) under the influence of climatic and geographic factors and formation of geochemical anomalies .
They also examined regularities in the accumulation of heavy metals in children's biosubstrates ( hair , urine ) and the nature of impact of their levels on the physical development of children in the organized collective bodies ( preschool institutions ) located in anomalous areas .
