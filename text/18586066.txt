For most people the main route of exposure to the toxic elements is through the diet .
Consequently , information concerning dietary intake is of the utmost importance in being able to assess risks to human health .
The goal of this study was to intend to assess the usefulness of hair as a biomonitor of the mineral status in young adults .
Daily intakes of selected toxic and essential mineral elements were evaluated using a food frequency questionnaire .
In addition , the levels of these same elements in hair samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry .
The contents of the essential elements in the study population were all well above Spanish recommendations for adult males and females .
The estimated intakes of toxic elements were appreciably below the respective PTWIs , indicating that these intake levels do not pose a health concern for this group .
Significant differences in hair metal levels were observed between the men and the women , who were in the same age group .
Interestingly , no correlation was found between trace element intakes and the corresponding levels in the hair .
In conclusion , hair is only limited usefulness as a means of estimating the nutritional status of the essential and toxic elements considered .
