Dietary intake has been hypothesized to be the major pathway of human exposure to perfluoroalkyl acids ( PFAAs ) .
However , difficulties associated with the analysis of PFAAs at ultra trace levels in food samples have prevented the confirmation of this hypothesis .
In this study , the dietary intake of PFAAs for the general Swedish population was estimated by applying a highly sensitive analytical method to a set of archived food market basket samples from 1999 , 2005 and 2010 .
Dietary exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid ( PFOS ) ( 860-1440 pg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ ) , perfluoroundecanoic acid ( PFUnDA ) ( 90-210 pg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ ) , perfluorodecanoic acid ( PFDA ) ( 50-110 pg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ ) and perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) ( 70-80 pg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ ) was dominated by the consumption of fish and meat .
In contrast , dietary exposure to PFOA ( 350-690 pg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ ) originated from low levels ( 8-62 pg g⁻¹ ) found in several high consumption food categories including cereals , dairy products , vegetables and fruit .
The dietary intakes of PFOS and PFOA estimated in this study were 4 to 10 times lower compared to previous exposure modeling studies .
Nevertheless , the dietary intake of PFOS and PFOA was still a factor of 6 to 10 higher than exposure through ingestion of household dust and drinking water estimated for the general Swedish population .
For perfluorohexanoic acid ( PFHxA ) , perfluoroheptanoic acid ( PFHpA ) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid ( PFHxS ) drinking water intake was the major exposure pathway ( 36-53% of the total exposure ) whereas dust ingestion made a significant contribution ( 27-49% ) to the total exposure for PFHxA , PFHpA , PFNA , perfluorotridecanoic acid ( PFTrDA ) and perfluorotetradecanoic acid ( PFTeDA ) .
Dietary intakes varied by less than a factor of three for all PFAAs during the different sampling years which demonstrates that dietary intake has been fairly constant over the past decade when many manufacturing changes occurred .
