Concerns for atmospheric pollution from auto exhaust have led to the blending of " oxygenates " with motor fuels .
The most common oxygenate , methyl tert-butyl ether ( MTBE ) is currently required within several metropolitan areas ( Denver and Phoenix ) in the range of 12% of the motor fuel .
Amendments to the Clean Air Act may expand this requirement to as many as 44 other areas of the United States in the near future .
In consideration of the magnitude of potential uncontrolled exposures from its extensive use and a related concern involving the potential influence of MTBE blending on exposures to other constituents of gasoline ( particularly benzene ) , an evaluation of exposures among service station attendants and operators was undertaken at the request , and in cooperation with , the American Petroleum Institute during the latter part of 1990 .
For application of the survey results to a broad audience , three categories or types of service stations were identified with regard to MTBE use and exposure potential : a ) service stations that do not use MTBE or use it only as an octane enhancer , b ) service stations with seasonal requirements to use 12-15% MTBE ( the Denver , Colorado , and Phoenix , Arizona , metropolitan areas ) , and c ) service stations equipped with stage II ( active ) vapor recovery systems ( several coastal areas , most notably Southern California ) .
At the two sampled service stations that use only minimal amounts of MTBE ( less than 1% ) , only 1 of 32 personal breathing zone ( PBZ ) samples from attendants was above the analytical limit of detection , reported at 0.16 ppm .
The geometric mean concentration of benzene among this same population ( n = 32 ) was 0.04 ppm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
