Concentrations of 12 hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( OH-PAHs ) were determined in 306 urine samples collected from seven Asian countries ( China , India , Japan , Korea , Kuwait , Malaysia , and Vietnam ) by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC-MS/MS ) .
The total concentrations of OH-PAHs found in the seven Asian countries were in the following increasing order : Malaysia ( median : 2260 pg/mL ) < Japan ( 4030 pg/mL ) < China ( 5770 pg/mL ) < India ( 6750 pg/mL ) < Vietnam ( 8560 pg/mL ) < Korea ( 9340 pg/mL ) < Kuwait ( 10170 pg/mL ) .
The measured urinary concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene ( 1-PYR ) in samples from Malaysia , Korea , and Japan ( \u223c 100 pg/mL ) were similar to those reported for North America and Western Europe .
The concentrations of 1-PYR in urine samples from China , India , and Vietnam were 4-10 times higher than those reported for other countries , thus far .
Among the 12 OH-PAH compounds analyzed , hydroxynaphthalene ( NAP : sum of 1-hydroxynaphthalene and 2-hydroxynaphthalene ) was the dominant compound ( accounting for 60-90% of total OH-PAHs ) , followed by hydroxyphenanthrene ( PHEN : sum of 2-hydroxyphenanthrene , 3-hydroxyphenanthrene , 4-hydroxyphenanthrene , and 9-hydroxyphenanthrene [ 3-16%] ) , 2-hydroxyfluorene ( 3-20% ) , and 1-PYR ( 2-8% ) .
The total daily intakes ( DIs ) of PAHs were estimated based on the urinary concentrations of their metabolites .
The DIs of naphthalene were found to be higher for populations in Korea , Kuwait , and Vietnam ( > 10 \u03bcg/day ) than those of the other countries studied ( \u223c 5 \u03bcg/day ) .
The DIs of phenanthrene and pyrene ( > 10 \u03bcg/day ) in the populations of China , India , and Vietnam were higher than those estimated for the populations in the other countries studied ( \u223c 5 \u03bcg/day ) .
