This study was conducted to assess the contamination status of 22 trace elements , especially As in water and residents in Tarkwa , a historic mining town in Ghana .
Drinking water and human urine samples were collected from Tarkwa in addition to control samples taken from Accra , the capital of Ghana in March , 2004 .
Concentrations of As and Mn in some drinking water samples from Tarkwa were found above the WHO drinking water guidelines posing a potential health risk for the people .
A potential health risk of As and Mn is a concern for the people consuming the contaminated water in this area .
No significant difference of As concentrations in human urine between mining town ( Tarkwa ) and control site ( Accra ) was observed .
Although As concentrations in drinking water in Tarkwa were low , urinary As levels were comparable to those reported in highly As-affected areas in the world .
These results suggest the presence of other sources of As contamination in Ghana .
This is the first study on multi-elemental contamination in drinking water and human from a mining town in Ghana .
