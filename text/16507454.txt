An established exposure-response relationship exists between water arsenic levels and skin lesions .
Results of previous studies with limited historical exposure data , and laboratory animal studies suggest that diet may modify arsenic metabolism and toxicity .
In this study , we evaluated the effect of diet on the risk of arsenic-related skin lesions in Pabna , Bangladesh .
Six hundred cases and 600 controls loosely matched on age and sex were enrolled at Dhaka Community Hospital , Bangladesh , in 2001-2002 .
Diet , demographic data , and water samples were collected .
Water samples were analyzed for arsenic using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy .
Betel nut use was associated with a greater risk of skin lesions in a multivariate model [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.67 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.18-2.36 ] .
Modest decreases in risk of skin lesions were associated with fruit intake 1-3 times/month ( OR = 0.68 ; 95%CI , 0.51-0.89 ) and canned goods at least 1 time/month ( OR = 0.41 ; 95% CI , 0.20-0.86 ) .
Bean intake at least 1 time/day ( OR = 1.89 ; 95% CI , 1.11-3.22 ) was associated with increased odds of skin lesions .
Betel nut use appears to be associated with increased risk of developing skin lesions in Bangladesh .
Increased intake of fruit and canned goods may be associated with reduced risk of lesions .
Increased intake of beans may be associated with an increased risk of skin lesions .
The results of this study do not provide clear support for a protective effect of vegetable and overall protein consumption against the development of skin lesions , but a modest benefit cannot be excluded .
