Neurobehavioral deficits have been reported in Egyptian pesticide application teams using organophosphorus ( OP ) pesticides , but whether these effects are related to OP pesticide exposures has yet to be established .
In preparation for a comprehensive study of the relationship between OP pesticide dose and neurobehavioral deficits , we assessed exposure within this population .
We conducted occupational surveys and workplace observations , and collected air , dermal patch and biological samples from applicators , technicians and engineers involved in chlorpyrifos applications during cotton production to test the hypotheses that : ( 1 ) dermal exposure was an important contributor to internal dose and varied across body regions ; and ( 2 ) substantial differences would be seen across the three job categories .
Applicators were substantially younger and had shorter exposure histories than did technicians and engineers .
Applicators and technicians were observed to have relatively high levels of skin or clothing contact with pesticide-treated foliage as they walked through the fields .
Both dermal patch loadings of chlorpyrifos and measurements of a chlorpyrifos-specific metabolite ( TCPy ) in urine confirmed substantial exposure to and skin absorption of chlorpyrifos that varied according to job category ; and dermal patch loading was significantly higher on the thighs than on the forearms .
These findings support our hypotheses and support the need for research to examine neurobehavioral performance and exposures in this population .
More importantly , the exposures reported here are sufficiently high to recommend urgent changes in work practices amongst these workers .
