To assess levels of dioxin background contamination and transfer of dioxins from mothers to unborn children and infants , concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and coplanar-polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) were measured in human samples from expectant and nursing mothers living in Nara , Japan .
The average toxic equivalency quantities ( TEQs ) of PCDDs/PCDFs and Co-PCBs from circulating maternal blood , cord blood , placenta , milk taken 3-10 d after delivery , milk taken one month after delivery , and adipose tissue were 26 and 9.3 , 15 and 2.3 , 31 and 1.2 , 16 and 5.4 , 18 and 8.8 , and 16 and 7.7 pg-TEQ/g-fat , respectively .
Among the various PCDD/PCDF congeners , 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF contributed most heavily to the TEQs of all maternal samples .
Among the various Co-PCB congeners , 3,3',4,4',5-PeCB ( #126 ) , 2,3,3',4,4',5-HxCB ( #156 ) , and 2,3',4,4',5-PeCB ( #118 ) contributed most heavily to the TEQs of all maternal samples .
But , the concentrations and relative percentages of congeners differed among the various samples , suggesting that congeners showing high toxic equivalency factor accumulate in the placenta .
