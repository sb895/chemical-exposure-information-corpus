In the Czech Republic , the Human Biomonitoring Project ( CZ-HBM ) was launched in 1994 as an integral part of the nationwide Environmental Health Monitoring System ( EHMS ) .
Until now , the HBM covers two time periods : the first covered 1994-2003 and the second , 2005-2009 .
Altogether three population groups were included in the HBM : adults ( blood donors aged 18-58 years ) , children aged 8-10 years , and breastfeeding primiparas .
Sampling is organized on a yearly basis .
Altogether three groups of biomarkers were analyzed : ( a ) selected heavy metals ( Pb , Cd , Hg ) and essential elements ( Cu , Se , Zn ) in blood and urine of adults and children , ( b ) indicator PCBs , DDT , DDE , HCB and HCHs in human milk and blood serum of adults and ( c ) cytogenetic changes in peripheral lymphocytes in blood of adults and children .
This paper is focused on the general design of the CZ-HBM , the trends over time , and reference values .
A significant downward time trend was observed for the blood lead levels in adults and children .
Increased urinary cadmium levels were observed in Czech children compared to German children .
The blood and urinary mercury levels were higher in women than in men .
The levels of indicator PCB congeners in the Czech human milk samples were still higher than in most other European countries , because of existing hot spots .
The levels of organochlorine pesticides showed a substantial continuous downward trend .
