The breast milk concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ; sum of five congeners : BDE-47 , -99 , -100 , -153 , and -154 ) were determined ( by GC-ECD ) in samples from 93 primiparous women collected from 1996 to 1999 in Uppsala County , Sweden .
Dietary and lifestyle factors were also recorded .
The mean PBDE concentration was 4.0 ng/g fat and the distribution of samples was skewed with few high values ( maximum 28.2 ng/g fat ) .
BDE-47 was the major congener and constituted 59% of the mean concentration of PBDEs .
No significant relationship was found between breast milk concentrations of PBDEs and dietary intake of PBDE , age , body mass index , alcohol consumption , or computer usage .
After adjustments for these factors , a weak but significant association between PBDE concentrations and smoking was observed .
The dietary intake of PBDE for these women was estimated at 27 ng/day , of which fish contributed almost half .
After inclusion of 31 additional samples , collected from 2000 to 2001 , time trends were studied .
The changes in breast milk PBDE levels between 1996 and 2001 , similar to the results from another Swedish study on milk from Stockholm mothers , suggest a peak in PBDE concentrations around 1998 and thereafter decreasing levels .
However , far-reaching conclusions about PBDE time trends in milk cannot be drawn from this short study .
