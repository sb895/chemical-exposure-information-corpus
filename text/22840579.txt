OBJECTIVE To investigate the influence of the polluted SY River on children's growth and sex hormones , and provide scientific data for assessment of the polluted status of the SY River .
METHODS The study areas were selected randomly from the SY River Basin .
Lead ( Pb ) , mercury ( Hg ) , arsenic ( As ) , phthalates ( DEP , DBP , DMP , DEHP ) , and bisphenol A ( BPA ) were measured both in the river water and in the drinking water .
School children were selected by cluster sampling ( n=154 ) .
Physical development indexes ( height , weight , bust-circumference , and skinfold thickness ) and sex hormones [ testosterone ( T ) and estradiol ( E2) ] were measured for all the children .
RESULTS The contents of Pb and Hg exceeded Class V standards of surface water quality in each section of the river and other indicators exceeded Class III .
Compared to the control area , the concentrations of Pb , Hg , As , BPA , DEP , and DBP in the drinking water were significantly higher than in the polluted area ( P<0.05 ) .
Children from the control area had significantly lower E2 and T than children from the polluted area ( P<0.05 ) .
Among anthropometric results , only skinfold thickness had statistically significant difference between the two groups ( P<0.05 ) , while the other indexes showed no significant differences between the two groups ( P>0.05 ) .
CONCLUSION The drinking water has been polluted by the SY River and affected serum sex hormone levels of children living in the polluted area .
