Assessment of DNA damage was carried out using alkaline comet assay in lymphocytes of 30 individuals exposed to high levels of arsenic ( 247.12+/-18.93 microg/l ) through contaminated groundwater in North 24 Parganas district , West Bengal , India .
All of them exhibited high arsenic contents in nail ( 4.20+/-0.67 microg/g ) , hair ( 2.06+/-0.20 microg/g ) and urine ( 259.75+/-33.89 microg/l ) samples and manifested various arsenical skin lesions .
Unexposed samples were collected from 30 residents of the unaffected East Midnapur district with very little or no exposure to arsenic ( 7.69+/-0.49 microg/l ) in drinking water .
The results were evaluated principally by manual analysis of comets and partly by computerized image analysis .
Both the analytical methods exhibited a high degree of agreement in results .
The exposed participants expressed significantly higher DNA damage ( p < 0.01 ) in their lymphocytes than the unexposed participants .
Alkaline comet assay was also combined with formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase enzyme digestion to confirm that arsenic induced oxidative base damage in the lymphocytes .
Significant positive trend effects of comet lengths in relation to arsenic levels in water prove that DNA damage can be used as a sensitive biomarker of arsenic exposure .
This study demonstrates that arsenic induced significant DNA damage in the exposed participants , which could correspond to a higher susceptibility to arsenic induced toxicity and carcinogenicity .
