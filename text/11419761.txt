An exposure risk assessment of workers in a refinery production unit was undertaken .
Gasoline and its main components were investigated through environmental and biological monitoring .
Measured variables were environmental benzene , toluene , pentane and hexane ; benzene and toluene in blood and urine ; tt-MA ( metabolite of benzene ) in urine .
Multivariate statistical analysis of the data showed that worker's exposure to the above substances fell within the limits specified by organisations such as ACGIH .
Also , biological values complied with reference values ( RV ) for non-occupationally-exposed population .
Different values of biological variables were determined by separating smokers from non-smokers : smokers had hematic and urinary benzene values significantly higher than non-smokers .
During a 3-yr sampling , it was possible to identify a significant decrease of benzene in the workplace air and of hematic benzene for non-smokers .
The most exposed department , one in which tank-lorries were loaded , needs further investigation and extended monitoring .
