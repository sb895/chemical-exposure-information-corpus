Organochlorine compounds ( OCCs ) , such as pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , are persistent lipophilic chemicals identified as endocrine disruptors , mainly with estrogen-like effects .
Northeastern Argentina , near the Paran√° River , is characterized by intensive farming and agricultural activities and industrial development , and is therefore prone to high incidences of environmental and dietary exposure to OCCs .
Hence , we conducted a study to ( 1 ) estimate the organochlorine residues present in mammary fat tissue in a population of women from this littoral region and ( 2 ) identify potential sources of exposure to OCCs .
Our subjects were 76 women ( residing in and around Santa Fe city and not occupationally exposed to organochlorines ) who underwent excision biopsy of a breast lesion or had plastic surgery .
Both frequency of occurrence and levels of organochlorine residues were high in breast adipose tissue of all the participants .
The organochlorine residues most frequently found were p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) in all the subjects analyzed , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) in 86.8% , and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane ( beta-HCH ) in 75.0% .
The incidence of PCB congeners was very low. p,p'-DDE and beta-HCH residues reached the highest levels , 4794 and 1780 ppb , respectively .
The diet was a relevant source of exposure , consumption of animal fat and freshwater fish playing a significant role .
Bioaccumulation was evidenced by the significant positive association between organochlorine levels and body mass index ( p = 0.0003 ) and the age of the patient ( p = 0.0002 ) .
The frequency and levels of OCCs found in our study population raise concerns regarding Argentinean exposure to these endocrine disruptors .
