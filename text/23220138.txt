This study aimed at investigating the presence and distribution of fluorotelomer alcohols ( FTOHs ) , perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) in house dust to evaluate human exposure to these compounds via dust ingestion. 31 house dust samples were collected from Bavaria , Germany and analyzed for 4:2 , 6:2 , 8:2 and 10:2 FTOH , PFOS and PFOA .
PFOA was the dominant compound in 79% of the dust samples , followed by PFOS and 8:2 FTOH , while 4:2 FTOH was not detected in any samples .
The total concentration of per- and polyfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) varied from 32.2 to 2456 ng/g .
In addition , the total ingestion rate for PFCs was 0.4-135 ng/d for adults and 5.1-246 ng/d for toddlers , and the highest 8:2 FTOH-based PFOA intake via indoor dust was 0.24 ng/d for adults and 0.44 ng/d for toddlers .
Overall , the results of this study demonstrate that dust ingestion is a minor pathway for human exposure to these PFCs ; the PFC ingestion via indoor dust is generally low , and only under a worst scenario high intakes have to be expected for toddlers .
