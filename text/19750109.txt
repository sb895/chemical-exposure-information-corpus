BACKGROUND Arsenic exposure in drinking water disproportionately affects small communities in some U.S. regions , including American Indian communities .
In U.S. adults with no seafood intake , median total urine arsenic is 3.4 microg/L .
OBJECTIVE We evaluated arsenic exposure and excretion patterns using urine samples collected over 10 years in a random sample of American Indians from Arizona , Oklahoma , and North and South Dakota who participated in a cohort study from 1989 to 1999 .
METHODS We measured total urine arsenic and arsenic species [ inorganic arsenic ( arsenite and arsenate ) , methylarsonate ( MA ) , dimethylarsinate ( DMA ) , and arsenobetaine ] concentrations in 60 participants ( three urine samples each , for a total of 180 urine samples ) using inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry ( ICPMS ) and high-performance liquid chromatography/ICPMS , respectively .
RESULTS Median ( 10th , 90th percentiles ) urine concentration for the sum of inorganic arsenic , MA , and DMA at baseline was 7.2 ( 3.1 , 16.9 ) microg/g creatinine ; the median was higher in Arizona ( 12.5 microg/g ) , intermediate in the Dakotas ( 9.1 microg/g ) , and lower in Oklahoma ( 4.4 microg/g ) .
The mean percentage distribution of arsenic species over the sum of inorganic and methylated species was 10.6% for inorganic arsenic , 18.4% for MA , and 70.9% for DMA .
The intraclass correlation coefficient for three repeated arsenic measurements over a 10-year period was 0.80 for the sum of inorganic and methylated species and 0.64 , 0.80 , and 0.77 for percent inorganic arsenic , percent MA , and percent DMA , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS This study found low to moderate inorganic arsenic exposure and confirmed long-term constancy in arsenic exposure and urine excretion patterns in American Indians from three U.S. regions over a 10-year period .
Our findings support the feasibility of analyzing arsenic species in large population-based studies with stored urine samples .
