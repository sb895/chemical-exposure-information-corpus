BACKGROUND The purpose of this paper is to present and evaluate descriptively bivariate associations between urinary metabolites of pesticides and herbicides and migrant camp conditions , violations , and personal worker behaviors at home for farmworkers who do not apply pesticides .
METHODS We studied 183 migrant farmworker camps in eastern North Carolina in 2010 .
Data and urine samples were collected from 371 men .
Predictor measures included violations in six domains of housing regulations and nonviolation characteristics and personal behaviors that might impact urinary metabolites .
RESULTS Cockroaches and bathroom violations were predictive of increased exposure to pyrethroids and cyfluthrin/chlorpyrifos , respectively .
Changing and storing clothing and shoes in sleeping rooms increased the number of detects for the diazinon metabolite .
CONCLUSIONS Farmworkers had exposures to multiple chemicals .
No single housing domain was identified as critical to mitigating housing-related exposure ; specific attention should be paid to changing and storing soiled clothing in sleeping rooms , and insect infestations .
