The use of DMPS as a diagnostic tool in patients with symptoms allegedly caused by mercury from dental amalgam fillings is disputed .
We have previously shown that the mercury concentrations in urine cannot be used in such a way .
In the present study , we wished to evaluate the effect on blood mercury levels ( B-Hg ) following intravenously injected DMPS in four groups of subjects : 19 controls without amalgam experience ; 21 healthy controls with amalgam fillings ; 20 patients with self-reported symptoms from existing dental amalgams ; and 20 patients who had removed amalgam fillings .
A single dose of DMPS ( 2 mg/kg ) was injected .
Blood samples were collected prior to the injection and after 15 , 30 , 120 min , and after 24 h , and mercury was analyzed by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometry .
All groups showed an initial drop of 24 to 30% in the blood levels , approaching baseline values ( 2.5-5.5 microg/l ) after 2 h .
The subjects with no amalgam experience had the lowest mercury values .
There was no significant difference between the three groups with such experience .
There were no significant differences between the two groups with amalgam fillings present .
Patients with symptoms allegedly caused by amalgam were not different from the control groups .
There were indications that part of the urinary mercury excreted during the first 30 min originated from blood .
