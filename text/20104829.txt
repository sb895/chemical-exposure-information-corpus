Arsenic is a known carcinogen .
It is also known to be readily dislodgeable from chromated copper arsenate ( CCA)-treated lumber .
The floors of in-service homes were tested for inorganic arsenic using a wipe method similar to the U.S. Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) method for lead dust clearance sampling .
Additionally , a hand-sampling method was used that involved direct dermal contact with the indoor floor surface .
Amount of dislodgeable arsenic on the decks was highly correlated with arsenic concentrations on the indoor floors .
Indoor arsenic concentrations were highest directly adjacent to the door .
Concentrations in samples taken from the middle of rooms were less than half the concentrations of door samples , while concentrations in samples taken from untrodden floor space in the corners were mostly below the method detection limit .
At a home without a CCA-treated deck , no measurable arsenic was found .
