To assess whether regular consumption of seafood , particularly fish and shellfish , by humans may lead to an overexposure to inorganic arsenic , a well-established human carcinogen , the urinary excretion of the relevant As metabolites ( Asi , inorganic form ; MMA , monomethylarsonic acid ; DMA , dimethylarsinic acid ) was compared in groups of subjects with different seafood consumption habits and in volunteers after ingestion of a known amount of seafood arsenicals .
Studies of Italian cohorts , involving five groups of +/-30 subjects with different seafood consumption habits , and balance studies in Belgian volunteers failed to show a biologically significant absorption of inorganic arsenic either present as such in the food or formed from organoarsenicals during cooking or digestion .
The results suggest that the digestion of some seafood , especially mussels , may increase the urinary excretion of the dimethylated arsenic metabolite .
Therefore , the biological monitoring of exposure to inorganic arsenic in an industrial context should mainly rely upon specific measurement of the unmetabolized form when recent ingestion of seafood cannot be excluded .
