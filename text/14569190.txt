BACKGROUND There is evidence that exposure to motor vehicle exhaust is associated with respiratory disease .
Studies in children have observed associations with wheeze , hospital admissions for asthma , and decrements in pulmonary function .
However , a relationship of adult respiratory disease with exposure to vehicular traffic has not been established .
METHODS We studied a sample of U.S. male veterans drawn from the general population of southeastern Massachusetts .
Information on respiratory symptoms and potential risk factors was collected by questionnaire .
We assessed distance from residential addresses to major roadways using geographic information system methodology .
RESULTS Adjusting for cigarette smoking , age , and occupational exposure to dust , men living within 50 m of a major roadway were more likely to report persistent wheeze ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.3 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.0-1.7 ) compared with those living more than 400 m away .
The risk was observed only for those living within 50 m of heavily trafficked roads ( >/=10,000 vehicles/24 h ) : OR = 1.7 ; CI = 1.2-2.4 ) .
The risk of patients experiencing chronic phlegm while living on heavily trafficked roads also increased ( OR = 1.4 ; CI = 1.0-2.0 ) , although there was little evidence for an association with chronic cough .
This association was not dependent on preexisting doctor-diagnosed chronic respiratory or heart disease .
CONCLUSIONS Exposure to vehicular emissions by living near busy roadways might contribute to symptoms of chronic respiratory disease in adults .
