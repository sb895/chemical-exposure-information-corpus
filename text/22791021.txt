This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate blood mercury ( B-Hg ) concentration of residents living in the vicinity of Chatian mercury mine ( CMM ) in southwestern China and to assess the possible effects on renal function .
It evaluates the effects of gender and age ( children , <18 years ; adults , 18-60 years ; elderly , >60 years ) on the B-Hg and serum creatinine ( SCR ) and serum urea nitrogen ( SUN ) levels .
In the CMM , elevated levels were found for B-Hg , SCR , and SUN with mean values at 6.09 \u03bcg/L , 74.21 \u03bcmol/L , and 13.26 mmol/L , which were significantly higher than those in the control area , respectively .
Moreover , the coefficients between paired results for B-Hg and SCR and SUN levels were positive at statistical significance ( B-Hg vs. SCR , r = 0.45 , p < 0.01 ; B-Hg vs. SUN , r = 0.20 , p < 0.05 ) .
The aforementioned results revealed that mercury exposure can cause human renal function impairment .
B-Hg , SCR , and SUN can also be useful biomarkers to assess the extent of mercury exposure among residents in areas with extensive mining activities .
Furthermore , data analysis revealed that there was a tendency for higher B-Hg , SCR , and SUN levels in females than in males , and the levels of B-Hg , SCR , and SUN increased among the older residents .
We conclude that females and the elderly in the mining area were more susceptible to mercury exposure , and therefore , they deserve further research .
