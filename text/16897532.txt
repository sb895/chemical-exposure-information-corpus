Food crops such as cassava , cocoyam and other tuber crops grown in mining communities uptake toxic or hazardous chemicals such as arsenic , and cadmium , from the soil .
Cassava is a stable food for Ghanaians .
This study evaluated human health risk from eating cassava grown in some mining communities in Ghana such as Bogoso , Prestea , Tarkwa and Tamso , which are important mining towns in the Western Region of Ghana .
The study evaluated cancer and non-cancer health effects from eating cassava grown in the study areas in accordance with US Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Assessment guidelines .
The results of the study revealed the following : cancer health risk for Tamso , 0.098 ( RME--Reasonable Maximum Exposure ) and 0.082 ( CTE--Central Tendency Exposure ) .
This means that approximately 10 and 8 out of 100 resident adults are likely to suffer from cancer related cases by RME and CTE parameters respectively .
For Prestea , we have 0.010 and 0.12 , which also means that approximately 1 out of 100 and 10 resident adults out of 100 are also likely to suffer from cancer related diseases by RME and CTE parameters .
The results of the study obtained were found to be above the acceptable cancer risk range of 1x 10(-6) to 1x 10(-4) , i.e. , 1 case of cancer out of 1 million or 100,000 people respectively .
