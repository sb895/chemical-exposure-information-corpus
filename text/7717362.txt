The effects of public drinking water contamination on birth outcomes were evaluated in an area of northern New Jersey .
After excluding plural births and chromosomal defects , 80,938 live births and 594 fetal deaths that occurred during the period 1985-1988 were studied .
Information on birth outcome status and maternal risk factors was obtained from vital records and the New Jersey Birth Defects Registry .
Monthly exposures during pregnancy were estimated for all births using tap water sample data .
Odds ratios of > or = 1.50 were found for the following : total trihalomethanes with small for gestational age , central nervous system defects , oral cleft defects , and major cardiac defects ; carbon tetrachloride with term low birth weight , small for gestational age , very low birth weight , total surveillance birth defects , central nervous system defects , neural tube defects , and oral cleft defects ; trichloroethylene with central nervous system defects , neural tube defects , and oral cleft defects ; tetrachloroethylene with oral cleft defects ; total dichloroethylenes with central nervous system defects and oral cleft defects ; benzene with neural tube defects and major cardiac defects ; and 1,2-dichloroethane with major cardiac defects .
Total trihalomethane levels > 100 ppb reduced birth weight among term births by 70.4 g .
By itself , this study cannot resolve whether the drinking water contaminants caused the adverse birth outcomes ; therefore , these findings should be followed up utilizing available drinking water contamination databases .
