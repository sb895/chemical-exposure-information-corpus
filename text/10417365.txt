Urinary arsenic ( As ) concentrations were evaluated as a biomarker of exposure in a U.S. population chronically exposed to inorganic As ( InAs ) in their drinking water .
Ninety-six individuals who consumed drinking water with As concentrations of 8-620 microg/L provided first morning urine voids for up to 5 consecutive days .
The study population was 56% male , and 44% was younger than 18 years of age .
On one day of the study period , all voided urines were collected over a 24-hr period .
Arsenic intake from drinking water was estimated from daily food diaries .
Comparison between the concentration of As in individual urine voids with that in the 24-hr urine collection indicated that the concentration of As in urine was stable throughout the day .
Comparison of the concentration of As in each first morning urine void over the 5-day study period indicated that there was little day-to-day variation in the concentration of As in urine .
The concentration of As in drinking water was a better predictor of the concentration of As in urine than was the estimated intake of As from drinking water .
The concentration of As in urine did not vary by gender .
An age-dependent difference in the concentration of As in urine may be attributed to the higher As dosage rate per unit body weight in children than in adults .
These findings suggest that the analysis of a small number of urine samples may be adequate to estimate an individual's exposure to InAs from drinking water and that the determination of the concentration of InAs in a drinking water supply may be a useful surrogate for estimating exposure to this metalloid .
