In order to characterize the different sources of exposure to arsenic ( As ) , urinary excretion of total As , the sum of inorganic As+MMA+DMA determined by the hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrophotometry technique , and the species As3 , As5 , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) and arsenobetaine were determined in 49 workers at a steel foundry , with presumed occupational exposure to As , and 50 subjects from the general population , all males .
No evidence of occupational exposure to As resulted from environmental monitoring performed in the foundry , although the analysis of minerals used as raw materials showed the presence of As , particularly in fossils and fine ores .
The urinary concentrations of As3 , MMA , DMA , the sum of inorganic As+MMA+DMA and total As were not different in the two groups , while arsenobetaine appeared significantly higher in the controls than in the workers .
The different species of urinary As were all significantly correlated .
Urinary excretion of As3 was associated with the consumption of mineral water and with residence in an industrial zone , while MMA , DMA , arsenobetaine , the sum of inorganic As+MMA+DMA and total As urinary excretion were associated with the consumption of crustaceans and/or shellfish 3 days or less before urine collection .
Multiple regression analysis confirmed these results .
In conclusion , in populations with a high consumption of seafood , living in areas characterized by coastal/marine As pollution , only speciation of As can identify a prevalent role of environmental sources , like the consumption of seafood contaminated by As , in determining urinary As excretion , and exclude an occupational origin of the exposure .
