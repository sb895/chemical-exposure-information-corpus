Thousands of Cambodia populations are currently at high risks of both toxic and carcinogenic effects through drinking arsenic-rich groundwater .
In order to determine and assess the use of arsenic contents in different biological samples as biomarkers of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking arsenic-rich groundwater in Cambodia , individual scalp hair , fingernail and toenail were collected from three different provinces in the Mekong River basin of Cambodia .
After washing and acid-digestion , digestate was analyzed for total arsenic by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .
Chemical analysis of the acid-digested hair revealed that among 270 hair samples cut from Kandal , 78.1% had arsenic content in scalp hair ( As(h) ) greater than the typical As(h) ( 1.00 \u03bcg g(-1) ) , indicating possible arsenic toxicity .
Concurrently , 1.2% and 0.6% were found elevated in Kratie ( n=84 ) and Kampong Cham ( n=173 ) , respectively .
Similarly , the upper end of the ranges for arsenic contents in fingernail ( As(fn) ) and toenail ( As(tn) ) clipped from Kandal ( fingernail n=241 ; toenail n=187 ) were higher than the normal arsenic content in nail ( 0.43-1.08 \u03bcg g(-1) ) , however , none was observed elevated in both Kratie ( fingernail n=76 , toenail n=42 ) and Kampong Cham ( fingernail n=83 ; toenail n=52 ) .
Significant positive intercorrelations between groundwater arsenic concentration ( As(w) ) , average daily dose ( ADD ) of arsenic , As(h) , As(fn) and As(tn) suggest that As(h) , As(fn) and As(tn) can be used as biomarkers of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking arsenic-rich groundwater , in which As(h) is more favorable than As(fn) and As(tn) due to the ease of sample processing and analytical measurements , respectively .
