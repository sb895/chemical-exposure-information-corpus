Eighty samples of sandy substrate were collected in November 2002 and 2003 , from 20 municipal playgrounds in Madrid ( Spain ) to assess the potential adverse health effects of the exposure of children to trace elements in this material during their games .
In each playground , two 500 g samples were collected , dried at 45 degrees C for 48 h , sieved below 100 microm , acid digested and analyzed by ICP-MS .
Doses contacted through ingestion and inhalation and the dose absorbed through the skin were calculated using USEPAs hourly exposure parameters for children and the results of an in situ survey .
The toxicity values considered in this study were mostly taken from the US DoEs RAIS compilation .
The results of the risk assessment indicate that the highest risk is associated with ingestion of soil particles and that the trace element of most concern is arsenic , the exposure to which results in a cancer risk value of 4.19 x 10(-6) , close to the 1 x 10(-5) probability level deemed unacceptable by most regulatory agencies .
Regarding non-cancer effects , exposure to playground substrate yields an aggregate Hazard Index of 0.28 , below the threshold value of 1 ( with As , again , as the largest single contributor , followed by Pb , Cr , Al and Mn ) .
Although the uncertainties associated with the estimates of toxicity values and exposure factors should be reduced before any definite conclusions regarding potential health effects are drawn , risk assessment has proven to be a very useful tool to identify the contaminants and exposure pathways of most concern in urban environments .
