Perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) are used in a variety of industrial and consumer products and have been detected worldwide in human blood .
The sources for human exposure are not well described , but dietary intake is suggested as an important source .
In this study of 652 Danish men from the Diet , Cancer and Health cohort , we examined intake of 10 major dietary groups , tap water drinks , alcohol consumption , cooking method , geographical area , age , smoking status , and BMI as potential determinants of PFOA and PFOS plasma levels .
Living in the Aarhus area was associated with higher PFOA and PFOS plasma levels compared with living in the Copenhagen area , and never smokers had higher levels than current smokers .
Frying as compared with other cooking methods was a determinant of PFOA and PFOS levels .
BMI and alcohol consumption were inversely associated with both compounds .
Among the dietary groups , only intake of eggs was significantly positively associated with PFOS plasma levels .
In future studies , PFOA and PFOS levels in air , dust and water samples should be measured to elucidate further the sources of exposure ; exposure through diet needs to be studied in greater detail .
Our finding of a higher body burden of PFOA and PFOS among never smokers also warrants further evaluation .
