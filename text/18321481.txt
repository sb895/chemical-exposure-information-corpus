In many developing countries , mercury is used to extract gold from ore in small-scale mining areas .
Exposure through mercury in these small-scale mining communities is a serious health hazard , especially to the children living and working there .
Many children begin working with immediate contact to mercury from the very early age of seven .
In Indonesia and Zimbabwe , 166 children were clinically examined for mercury .
The mercury concentration in the blood , urine , and hair was analyzed .
Compared to the control groups , the exposed children showed typical symptoms of mercury intoxication , such as ataxia .
The children working with mercury had high levels of this substance in the various biomonitors .
The exposure derives mainly from the liquid mercury used to bind gold , forming an amalgam .
The amalgam is heated and the smelting amalgam releases mercury vapor plus the wanted gold .
Mercury vapor in contrast to liquid mercury is highly toxic .
This elemental , vaporized mercury is the main form of exposure .
Since in over 50 countries children live in small-scale gold mining areas and are exposed in a similar way to mercury , immediate action is needed to reduce this severe chemical health hazard for children .
Child labor with hazardous substances such as mercury must be stopped .
