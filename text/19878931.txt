The purposes of this study were to assess the hair mercury concentration of women of childbearing age in Taiwan , and to calculate a hazard quotient ( HQ ) to evaluate the risk of fish consumption for these women .
We also examined perceptions of risk associated with fish consumption and whether women in our study changed their habits in response to such risks .
The average concentration of mercury was 1.73+/-2.12microgg(-1) ( range : 0.02-16.34microgg(-1) ) , exceeding the US EPA reference dose of 1microgg(-1) in 52.9% of study subjects .
The WHO tolerance limit of 10microgg(-1) was exceeded in 1.5% of study subjects .
Hair mercury concentration in groups who consumed fish was significantly higher than in groups who never consumed fish ( p<0.05 ) .
The hazard quotient ( exposure estimate/oral reference dose ) exceeded 1.0 for 29% of subjects , based on the US EPA's reference dose ( 0.1microgkg(-1)d(-1) ) , and the average HQ equaled 1.26 .
When told that some fish contain high levels of mercury that may be harmful for unborn babies , 67.6% of women still indicated that they would not change their amount of fish intake .
The high hair mercury concentrations among women of childbearing age in Taiwan are a cause for concern , due to the effect on babies ' brain development .
The government should provide specific information about risks and benefits of fish consumption for women to make risk-balancing decisions .
