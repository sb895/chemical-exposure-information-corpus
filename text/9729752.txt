Little data on the prevalence of acute and chronic pesticide exposure among farmers and the frequency of protective gear use are available .
This report presents results of a cross-sectional study of pesticide behaviors among dairy farmers certified to apply pesticides to field crops .
Private dairy farmers residing in six adjacent Wisconsin counties were randomly selected and contacted by telephone for interview .
One hundred ninety-one farmers completed the interview ( response rate , 76.4% ) .
Twelve percent reported never or almost never wearing gloves during application , and 53.7% reported never or almost never wearing other protective gear .
Thirty-two percent reported dermal exposure , and 32.0% reported inhaling pesticides during last application .
Findings suggest that exposure to pesticides was frequent in this sample , whereas use of personal protective equipment was not routine .
