Following our first report on elevated polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE ) concentrations in California women , we expanded our investigation to include diverse groups of local women .
We analyzed additional adipose and serum samples collected in the late 1990s from San Francisco Bay Area women participating in a breast cancer study and in a reproductive study , respectively .
Adipose samples ( n = 32 ) were analyzed by low-resolution mass spectrometry in negative-ion chemical ionization mode , whereas serum samples ( n = 50 ) were analyzed by dual-column gas chromatography with electron capture detection .
The results confirmed our earlier findings .
Concentrations of 2,2,4,4 -tetrabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-47 ) in contemporary California women ranged between 5 and 510 ng/g lipid , with a median ( 16.5 ng/g lipid ) 3-10 times higher than those reported from Europe .
In contrast , PBDEs were not measurable in any of 420 archived serum samples collected in the 1960s from San Francisco Bay Area women participating in a study of child development .
BDE-47 concentrations did not increase with age or with concentrations of a polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB-153 ) , suggesting other routes of exposure in addition to diet .
Rising body burdens of endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as PBDEs may pose a potential public health threat .
