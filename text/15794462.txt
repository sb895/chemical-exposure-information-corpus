This paper reports on a study of indoor air quality in homes and child care facilities in non-metropolitan counties of New York State .
Specific pollutants examined were lead , radon , carbon monoxide , asbestos , and mold .
Some homes had high levels of pollutants , and certain pollutants were significantly and negatively correlated with household income .
High levels of pollutants also were observed in many child care facilities , which raises questions about constant exposure of children to pollutants .
Recommendations are made for lowering pollutant levels in low-income households and child care facilities .
