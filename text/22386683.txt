The consumption of home grown vegetables may represent a significant exposure pathway for arsenic ( As ) and lead ( Pb ) relative to direct incidental ingestion of soil , thus a probabilistic screening tool for estimating these exposures was developed using regression models relating co-located soil and home garden ( HG ) vegetable concentrations of Pb and As established from multiple independent studies and 2-dimensional Monte Carlo analyses .
For high-quantity consumers of HG vegetables ( i.e. , the upper 95th percentile of consumers in the general population ) , the HG consumption pathway can be as significant as incidental soil and dust ingestion for inorganic As and , therefore , should be considered when developing generic health-based soil criteria in residential settings .
Predicted Pb Hazard Quotient ( HQ ) estimates among young children resulting from HG consumption were 4- to 10-fold lower than exposures resulting from direct incidental soil and dust ingestion .
The difference in soil/dust ingestion rates used to characterize young children ( the 95th percentile of 202 mg/d ) versus a lifetime residential receptor ( the 95th percentile of 30 mg/d ) was a primary factor contributing to the relative differences observed between HQ and incremental lifetime cancer risk ( ILCR ) resulting from these two exposure pathways for lead Pb and inorganic arsenic As , respectively .
