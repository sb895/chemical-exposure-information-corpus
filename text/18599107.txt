As part of a longitudinal cohort study , now in its second decade , we determined PCDDs/Fs dl-PCBs and PBDEs in serum of adolescents with known perinatal PCDD/F exposure .
Of the original cohort , 33 adolescents aged 14-19 years , who had been studied previously during their neonatal ( n=60 ) , toddler and pre-pubertal period ( n=41 ) agreed to participate in the current follow-up .
PCDD/F- , dl-PCB- and PBDE congeners were measured using GC/MS .
Current serum levels of PCDD/Fs determined in our cohort were relatively low ( mean of 2.2 pg/g ) compared to the perinatal exposure .
No correlation between perinatal exposure and current serum PCDD/F was found .
Planar PCB TEQ levels were 2.2 pg/g .
Current summation operatorPBDE levels were 8.7 ng/g lipid .
There was one outlier with a summation operatorPBDE of 74 ng/g lipid .
The presence of this high value indicates that the exposure pathway is different from PCDD/F and PCB , most likely by dust and food contaminated with dust .
Concluding we can say that current PCDD/F levels are quite low compared to the perinatal PCDD/F exposure of the cohort .
PBDE levels however are relatively high compared to other European countries , more research on possible health effects of these levels , especially for subjects with outlier concentrations , should be performed .
