BACKGROUND Recent studies suggest elevated exposure to drinking water disinfection by-products ( DBPs ) may be associated with decreased risk of preterm birth .
We examined this association for exposure to total trihalomethanes ( TTHMs ) , 5 haloacetic acids ( HAA5 ) , and total organic halides .
METHODS Analysis included 2039 women in a prospective pregnancy study conducted from 2000 through 2004 in 3 study sites .
Water samples were collected and analyzed for DBP concentrations .
Participant data were collected through interviews , an early ultrasound , and birth records .
We assessed the associations between DBPs and preterm birth ( <37-weeks ' gestation ) using log-binomial regression .
Discrete-time hazard analysis was used to model the conditional odds of delivery each week in relation to DBP exposure .
RESULTS Average second trimester DBP levels were associated with lower risk of preterm birth .
Adjusted risk ratios for TTHM levels of 33.1-55.0 , 55.1-66.3 , 66.4-74.8 , and 74.9-108.8 microg/L versus 2.2-4.6 microg/L were 0.8 ( 95% confidence intervals = 0.5-1.3 ) , 0.9 ( 0.6-1.4 ) , 0.7 ( 0.4-1.1 ) , and 0.5 ( 0.3-0.9 ) , respectively .
Risk ratios for HAA5 levels of 17.9-22.0 , 22.1-31.5 , 31.6-40.4 , and 40.5-52.8 microg/L versus 0-0.9 microg/L were 1.1 ( 0.8-1.7 ) , 0.8 ( 0.5-1.2 ) , 0.5 ( 0.3-0.8 ) , and 0.7 ( 0.4-1.1 ) , respectively .
The conditional odds of delivery each week were decreased for the highest TTHM and HAA5 exposure groups versus the low exposure group for gestational weeks 33-40 .
CONCLUSIONS The probability of preterm birth was not increased with high DBP exposure .
