Associations between positive thyroid autoantibodies and total blood mercury in women were evaluated using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) , 2007-2008 .
Women are at increased risk for autoimmune disorders , mercury exposure has been associated with cellular autoimmunity and mercury accumulates in the thyroid gland .
We used multiple logistic regression to evaluate the associations between total bloodmercury and thyroglobulin autoantibody antibody positivity and thyroid peroxidase autoantibody positivity in non-pregnant , non-lactating women aged 20 and older not currently using birth control pills or other hormone therapies , adjusted for demographic factors , menopausal status , nutrient intake and urine iodine ( n=2047 ) .
Relative to women with the lowest mercury levels ( \u22640.40 \u03bcg/L ) , women with mercury >1.81 \u03bcg/L ( upper quintile ) showed 2.24 ( 95% CI=1.22 , 4.12 ) greater odds for thyroglobulin autoantibody positivity ( p(trend)=0.032 ) ; this relationship was not evident for thyroid peroxidase autoantibody positivity .
Results suggest an association between mercury and thyroglobulin autoantibody positivity .
