This study was conducted to investigate a possible etiological role of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the pathogenesis of repeated miscarriages .
The blood levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons [ CHCs : pentachlorophenol , hexachlorocyclohexane , hexachlorobenzene , the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) group , polychlorinated biphenyls ] were determined in 89 women with repeated miscarriages , who were referred to the University Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Heidelberg for investigations between 1989 and 1993 , and compared to a previously investigated reference population .
In more than 20% of the women , at least one of the CHC levels exceeded the reference range .
CHC levels did not differ significantly between women with primary or secondary and early or late miscarriages ; neither did they differ between women with hormonal or immunological disorders as causes of repeated miscarriages or women with idiopathic repeated miscarriages .
No significant associations were detected between CHC levels and further conceptions or the outcome of further pregnancies .
As significant associations were found between increasing CHC blood concentrations and immunological and hormonal changes , CHCs may have an impact on the pregnancy course in certain cases .
