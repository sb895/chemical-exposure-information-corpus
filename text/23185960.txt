Higher house dust levels of PBDE flame retardants ( FRs ) have been reported in California than other parts of the world , due to the state's furniture flammability standard .
However , changing levels of these and other FRs have not been evaluated following the 2004 U.S. phase-out of PentaBDE and OctaBDE .
We analyzed dust collected in 16 California homes in 2006 and again in 2011 for 62 FRs and organohalogens , which represents the broadest investigation of FRs in homes .
Fifty-five compounds were detected in at least one sample ; 41 in at least 50% of samples .
Concentrations of chlorinated OPFRs , including two ( TCEP and TDCIPP ) listed as carcinogens under California's Proposition 65 , were found up to 0.01% in dust , higher than previously reported in the U.S. In 75% of the homes , we detected TDBPP , or brominated " Tris, " which was banned in children's sleepwear because of carcinogenicity .
To our knowledge , this is the first report on TDBPP in house dust .
Concentrations of Firemaster 550 components ( EH-TBB , BEH-TEBP , and TPHP ) were higher in 2011 than 2006 , consistent with its use as a PentaBDE replacement .
Results highlight the evolving nature of FR exposures and suggest that manufacturers continue to use hazardous chemicals and replace chemicals of concern with chemicals with uncharacterized toxicity .
