Previous studies have reported an increased risk of myocardial infarction ( MI ) associated with acute increases in PM concentration .
Recently , we reported that MI/fine particle ( PM2.5 ) associations may be limited to transmural infarctions .
In this study , we retained data on hospital discharges with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction ( using International Classification of Diseases ninth Revision [ ICD-9 ] codes ) , for those admitted January 1 , 2004 to December 31 , 2006 , who were \u2265 18 years of age , and were residents of New Jersey at the time of their MI .
We excluded MI with a diagnosis of a previous MI and MI coded as a subendocardial infarction , leaving n = 1563 transmural infarctions available for analysis .
We coupled these health data with PM2.5 species concentrations predicted by the Community Multiscale Air Quality chemical transport model , ambient PM2.5 concentrations , and used the same case-crossover methods to evaluate whether the relative odds of transmural MI associated with increased PM2.5 concentration is modified by the PM2.5 composition/mixture ( i.e. , mass fractions of sulfate , nitrate , elemental carbon , organic carbon , and ammonium ) .
We found the largest relative odds estimates on the days with the highest tertile of sulfate mass fraction ( OR = 1.13 ; 95% CI = 1.00 , 1.27 ) , nitrate mass fraction ( OR = 1.18 ; 95% CI = 0.98 , 1.35 ) , and ammonium mass fraction ( OR = 1.13 ; 95% CI = 1.00 1.28 ) , and the lowest tertile of EC mass fraction ( OR = 1.17 ; 95% CI = 1.03 , 1.34 ) .
Air pollution mixtures on these days were enhanced in pollutants formed through atmospheric chemistry ( i.e. , secondary PM2.5 ) and depleted in primary pollutants ( e.g. , EC ) .
When mixtures were laden with secondary PM species ( sulfate , nitrate , and/or organics ) , we observed larger relative odds of myocardial infarction associated with increased PM2.5 concentrations .
Further work is needed to confirm these findings and examine which secondary PM2.5 component(s) is/are responsible for an acute MI response .
