Multipathway exposures were evaluated for residents of houses over a 10-day period following a crack and crevice application of a chlorpyrifos-based formulation .
Three multiroom houses with two adults each were treated .
Air concentration , total deposition , and dislodgeable residues on horizontal surfaces were measured to assess potential respiratory , oral , and dermal exposures , respectively , in treated and untreated high activity rooms .
In addition , urine samples collected from the adults were analyzed for the primary metabolite of chlorpyrifos , 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol , to determine absorbed dose .
The maximum chlorpyrifos air concentration observed was 2.3 microgram/m3 , with air concentrations generally decreasing to levels ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 microgram/m3 within 10 days .
Carpet dislodgeable residues , used to evaluate the amount of residues potentially transferred upon contact , were less than the analytical method limit of quantitation ( 1.6 microgram/m2 ) .
Hard plastic balls placed in the homes on the day before application contained no detectable dislodgeable residues ( <6.5 microgram/m2 ) .
Ten-day cumulative nontarget residues deposited on surfaces , as determined by deposition pads , were less than 2.3 microgram/100 cm2 .
Deposition samples from all living area floors collected 2 hr after application contained less than 9.9 microgram/100 cm2 .
Therefore , contact with household surfaces and subsequent hand-to-mouth activity are not expected to significantly contribute to overall exposure .
Estimated exposures to children , based on the passive dosimetry measurements , ranged from 0.26 to 2.1% of the no observed effect level for plasma cholinesterase depression .
In addition , potential exposures to the adult residents , as indicated by the urinary 3,5,6-TCP biomonitoring , did not increase as a result of the application .
