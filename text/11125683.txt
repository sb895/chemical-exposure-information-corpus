The present study examined the associations between drinking water and urinary arsenic levels and skin lesions among 167 residents of three contiguous villages in Bangladesh .
Thirty-six ( 21.6% ) had skin lesions ( melanosis , hyperkeratosis , or both ) , of which 13 ( 36.1% ) occurred in subjects who were currently drinking water containing concentrations of arsenic < 50 micrograms/L .
The risk for skin lesions in relation to the exposure estimates based on urinary arsenic was elevated more than 3-fold , with the odds ratios for the highest versus the lowest quartiles being 3.6 ( 95% confidence interval , 1.2 to 12.1 ) for urinary total arsenic and 3.2 ( 95% confidence interval , 1.1 to 10.0 ) for urinary creatinine-adjusted total arsenic .
The risks for skin lesions in relation to the exposure estimates based on arsenic in drinking water were less strongly elevated , with the odds ratios for the highest versus the lowest quartiles of exposure being 1.7 ( 95% confidence interval , 0.6 to 5.1 ) for drinking-water arsenic and 2.3 for cumulative arsenic index .
The study suggests that arsenic exposure is associated with skin lesions in the Bangladesh population and that urinary arsenic may be a stronger predictor of skin lesions than arsenic in drinking water in this population .
