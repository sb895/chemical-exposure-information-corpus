In the present investigation , eleven human adipose tissue samples , two seal blubber samples and two pelican muscles samples were analyzed with regard to their concentrations of PCB parent compounds as well as to the respective chiral methylsulfonyl metabolites 3-MeSO2-CB 91 , 4-MeSO2-CB 91 , 3-MeSO2-CB 95 , 4-MeSO2-CB 95 , 3-MeSO2-CB 149 , 4-MeSO2-CB 149 , 3-MeSO2-CB 132 , 4-MeSO2-CB 132 , 3-MeSO2-CB 174 , and 4-MeSO2-CB 174 and the achiral metabolites 3-MeSO2-CB 49 , 4-MeSO2-CB 49 , 3-MeSO2-CB 101 , 4-MeSO2-CB 101 , 3-MeSO2-CB 110 , 4-MeSO2-CB 110 and 3-MeSO2-DDE .
In order to verify enantioselective transformation processes and to compare the different enzymatic transformation pathways in birds and mammals , the enantioselective excesses of the chiral PCB-metabolites were determined by enantioselective gas chromatography with electron capture and mass spectrometric detection using modified cyclodextrin phases , including heptakis(2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-)-beta-cyclodextrin/OV1701 ( 1:1 ) for the parent PCBs and heptakis(2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-)-beta-cyclodextrin/SE52 ( 1:4 ) for the metabolites , respectively .
