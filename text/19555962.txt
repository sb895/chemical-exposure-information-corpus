OBJECTIVE To assess maternal-fetal exposure to phthalates and investigate whether in utero phthalate exposure is associated with low birth weight ( LBW ) .
STUDY DESIGN A total of 201 newborn-mother pairs ( 88 LBW cases and 113 controls ) residing in Shanghai were enrolled in this nested case-control study during 2005-2006 .
Maternal blood , cord blood , and meconium specimens were collected and analyzed for phthalates by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry .
Nonparametric tests were used to compare demographic characteristics in cases and controls .
Conditional logistic regression and Spearman correlation were used to analyze the association between phthalate exposure and LBW .
RESULTS No significant differences in gestational age , prepregnancy body mass index , prenatal care , vitamin supplementation , or socioeconomic levels were found between the LBW and control infants .
More than 70% of the biosamples had quantifiable levels of phthalates , with higher levels in the LBW infants compared with the controls .
Prenatal di-n-butyl phthalate ( DBP ) exposure was associated with LBW , and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) was negatively associated with birth length .
After adjusting for the potential confounders , DBP concentrations in the highest quartile were associated with an increased risk of LBW .
CONCLUSIONS Newborns in China are ubiquitously exposed to phthalates ; significantly higher phthalate levels were detected in LBW cases compared with controls .
In utero DBP and DEHP exposures were associated with LBW in a dose-dependent manner .
Prenatal phthalate exposure may be a risk factor for LBW .
