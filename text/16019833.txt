The objective of this study was to investigate Cd , Pb , and Hg levels in the breast milk of 158 lactating healthy women who were not occupationally exposed and living in eight environmentally different polluted locations of the Slovak Republic .
Levels of these metals were examined in relation to selected parameters , such as : location , mother's age , parity , number of mother's teeth fillings , newborn's gender and birth weight , and smoking habits in the family .
Cd and Pb levels in human milk and reconstituted infant formula were determined by GFAAS .
Hg levels were measured by amalgamation technique AAS .
The average concentrations of Cd , Pb and Hg in breast milk samples , taken on the 4th postpartum day , were 0.43 , 4.7 and 0.94 microg/kg , respectively , and those in infant formula ( n = 10 ) were 0.40 , 5.0 and 0.25 microg/kg , respectively .
Dietary weekly intakes of Cd , Pb , and Hg from breast milk and infant formula in newborn babies were also estimated .
Whereas the calculated average dietary intakes of Cd , Pb , and Hg in newborn babies from breast milk and infant formula were all far lower than the appropriate PTWI values recommended by WHO/FAO , two individual breast milk samples for Pb and one breast milk sample for Hg exceeded the PTWI values .
Regarding the studied parameters , only the active/passive smoking of the mother at home significantly increased Pb levels in breast milk and amalgam teeth fillings increased Hg levels in breast milk .
