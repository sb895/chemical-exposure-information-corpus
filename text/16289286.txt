Endometriosis has been hypothesised to be linked to persistent and toxic organochlorinated chemicals .
Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds have in particular been associated with the disease , mainly on the basis of experimental studies .
Data in women are conflicting .
A case-control study on 80 Italian nulliparous women of reproductive age was carried out to assess whether there is a correlation between the presence of endometriosis and blood levels of polychlorobiphenyls ( PCBs ) , a family of ubiquitary environmental pollutants which comprises congeners with dioxin-like activity .
Higher levels of PCBs were found in women with endometriosis .
A mean cumulative value of 410 ng g(-1) , lipid base , was found in cases versus the value of 250 ng g(-1) observed in the control group ( odds ratio for upper tertile 4.0 , CI 95% 1.3-13 ; p = 0.0003 ) .
PCB increase involved both dioxin-like ( PCBs 105 , 118 , 156 , and 167 ) and non-dioxin-like congeners ( PCBs 101 , 138 , 153 , 170 , 180 ) .
