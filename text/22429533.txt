This study aimed to evaluate possible health effects associated with long-term occupational exposure to low levels of mercury vapors .
Forty-six subjects exposed to mercury and 65 healthy unexposed employees were studied .
The subjects were administered a questionnaire on experienced symptoms and underwent clinical examinations as well as routine biochemical tests .
Atmospheric and urinary concentrations of mercury were measured , too .
Environmental concentrations of mercury were estimated to be 3.97 ± 6.28 \u03bcg/m(3) and urinary concentrations of mercury in exposed and referent groups were 34.30 ± 26.77 and 10.15 ± 3.82 \u03bcg/dm(3) , respectively .
Additionally , symptoms such as somatic fatigue , anorexia , loss of memory , erethism , blurred vision and teeth problems were significantly more common among exposed individuals .
These observations indicate that occupational exposure to mercury vapors , even at low levels , is likely to be associated with neurological and psychological symptoms .
