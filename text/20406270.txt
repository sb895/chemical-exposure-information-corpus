OBJECTIVES The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study ( MoBa ) started in 1999 to identify environmental factors that could be involved in mechanisms leading to disease .
Questions have been raised about potential risks to the fetus from prenatal exposure to mercury from amalgam fillings in pregnant women .
The aim of the present study was to identify factors potentially associated with amalgam fillings in pregnant women participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study ( MoBa ) .
An additional aim was to obtain information about dental treatment in the cohort .
METHODS Total of 67,355 pregnancies from the MoBa study were included in the present study .
Information regarding age , education , smoking habits , alcohol consumption , weight , and height for the women was obtained from a questionnaire that was filled in at the 17th week of pregnancy .
In another questionnaire , which was sent to all participants in the 30th week of pregnancy , the women reported types of dental treatment during pregnancy , total number of teeth , and number of teeth with amalgam fillings .
The self-assessed number of teeth and number of teeth with amalgam fillings were validated in an external sample of 97 women of childbearing age .
RESULTS Odds ratio for having more than 12 teeth with amalgam fillings increased considerably with age .
Other significant risk factors for having high exposure to amalgam were low education , high body mass index ( BMI ) , and smoking during pregnancy .
Women with the lowest levels of education had a twofold increased odds ratio of having more than 12 teeth filled with amalgam compared with women who had more than 4 years of university studies .
According to the results from the validation of self-assessed number of teeth with amalgam fillings , the information obtained was reliable .
CONCLUSION Age , education , smoking habits , and BMI were associated with amalgam exposure .
