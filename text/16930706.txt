Mercury is a hazardous metal responsible for environmental contamination and human intoxication .
Methylmercury , a very toxic organic compound , bio-accumulates through food chain , and is responsible for chronic mercury exposure of riverside Amazonian communities with a diet rich in fish .
Uncertainties about the reference exposure dose that could have damaging consequences for nervous system development makes necessary the biomonitoring of these Amazonian populations , especially children .
In this work , a comparative study was performed in exposed and non-exposed children living in the Amazon .
A total of 168 children were analyzed to find possible correlations between gender , age , location , and hair mercury content .
For each location , no statistically significant differences ( P<0.05 ) were detected for gender and age versus mercury content .
However , mean mercury levels in hair samples may indicate a tendency of boys to average higher hair concentrations .
Also , in the community with highest levels of mercury , the limit of 10 micro g/g of mercury was surpassed by 65% of 2-6 years and 50% of 7-12 years children but only by 27% of 0-1 year babies , pointing to a lower bioaccumulation and/or the existence of a protection mechanism in babies .
Log normal distributions of mercury concentrations for each location showed that children from populations under influence of gold mining activity contain the highest mercury levels in hair samples , though this intoxication may have decreased when compared to previous studies .
Knowledge originated by this monitoring will better assist in the development of prevention strategies and government actions targeting the mercury contamination of Amazonian environment .
