Potential dermal exposure measurements of horticultural and floricultural field operators that handled concentrated pesticides showed a correlation with the types of formulations used ( liquid or solid ) during the mix and load stage .
For liquid formulations , hand exposure was 22-62 times greater than that for solid ones .
The dermal exposure mechanism was studied for this formulation under laboratory conditions , finding that the rupture of the aluminum seal of the pesticide container and the color of the liquid formulation are important factors .
Additionally , significant external surface contamination of pesticide containers collected at horticultural farms was found .
This could partially account for the differences between the exposure levels of field and laboratory experiments for liquid formulations .
