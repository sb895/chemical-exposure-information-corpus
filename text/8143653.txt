A multidisciplinary study on a general population exposed to vehicle exhaust was undertaken in Pisa in 1991 .
Environmental factors such as air pollution and those associated with lifestyle were studied .
Meanwhile , biological and medical indicators of health condition were investigated .
Chromosomal aberrations , sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) , and micronuclei in lymphocytes were included for the assessment of the genotoxic risk .
Because of the large number ( 3800 ) of subjects being investigated , standardization of protocols was compulsory .
The results on data reproducibility are reported .
To assess the reliability of the protocol on a large scale , the population of Porto Tolle , a village located in northeast Italy , was studied and compared to a subset of the Pisa population .
Preliminary results showed that probable differences between the two populations and individuals were present in terms of SCE frequencies .
The study was potentially able to detect the effects of several factors such as age , smoking , genetics , and environment .
The in vitro treatment of lymphocytes with diepoxybutane confirmed the presence of more responsive individuals and permitted us to investigate the genetic predisposition to genetic damage .
The possible influence of environmental factors was studied by correlation analyses with external exposure to air pollutants as well as with several lifestyle factors .
