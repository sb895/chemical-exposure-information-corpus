Two hundred and twenty-six breast milk samples were collected from lactating women from 3 blocks of North-24 Paragans , one of the arsenic-affected districts of West Bengal , India .
Out of 226 samples , only in 39 samples arsenic was detected .
Urine , hair , and nail samples were also analyzed to know the arsenic body burden of the lactating women .
Arsenic in drinking water was also analyzed .
Principle component analysis ( PCA ) revealed that hair and nail arsenic was highly correlated with water arsenic concentrations , whereas arsenic in urine and breast milk did not cluster with water arsenic .
Our present study indicated that among the lactating women who had high arsenic body burden and arsenical skin lesions , they had elevated level of arsenic in their breast milk .
Arsenic in hair , nails , and urine samples of infants were analyzed , and the results showed significantly high-body burden of infants in those areas .
PCA showed the age-dependent relationship between the hair and nail arsenic concentrations of the mothers and their babies .
