Concentrations of 15 VOCs including 1,3-butadiene , benzene , and styrene were measured in a wide range of urban microenvironments , viz : homes , offices , restaurants , pubs , department stores , coach and train stations , cinemas , libraries , laboratories , perfume shops , heavily trafficked roadside locations , buses , trains , and automobiles .
For most target VOCs-including 1,3-butadiene and benzene-mean concentrations at heavily trafficked roadside locations were exceeded by those in automobiles and were comparable to those in pubs and train stations .
With regard to indoor-outdoor relationships in homes , this study revealed higher mean indoor concentrations , no correlation between simultaneously measured indoor and outdoor concentrations , and significantly different patterns of diurnal variation .
Thus-in poorly ventilated buildings-indoor emission source strength is considered a more significant influence on VOC concentrations than infiltration of outdoor air .
In the six smoking homes studied , environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) was found to make a substantial contribution to concentrations of 1,3-butadiene .
This finding was based on the significantly higher concentrations detected in smoking compared to nonsmoking homes , the significant correlation between 1,3-butadiene concentrations and those of 3-ethenylpyridine ( an ETS marker ) , factor analysis , and the results of a source apportionment exercise based on ratios of 1,3-butadiene to 3-ethenylpyridine .
