Studies on mercury levels in the Amazonian Region have typically lacked background or reference parameters .
A sectional study on Hg concentration in hair and fish was conducted , together with an assessment of the prevalence of signs and symptoms related to Hg poisoning , in four communities in the Amazon Basin not impacted by gold mining , located either by a river course ( Santana do Ituqui and Caxiuanã ) or by a lake ( Aldeia do Lago Grande and Vila do Tabatinga ) .
Mercury determinations in hair and fish were made by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry .
Mean total Hg in hair was 4.33 microg/g ( 0.40-11.60 microg/g ) in 321 individuals from Santana do Ituqui , 3.98 microg/g ( 0.40-11.76 microg/g ) for 316 persons in Aldeia do Lago Grande , 5.46 microg/g ( 0.37-49.85 microg/g ) for 504 individuals from Vila do Tabatinga and 8.58 microg/g ( 0.61-45.59 microg/g ) for 203 inhabitants from Caxiuanã .
Fish consumption was very high in all those communities but no signs or symptoms associated with Hg poisoning were found .
Mean Hg concentration in fish varied from 0.006 to 2.529 microg/g for carnivores and from 0.008 to 0.871 microg/g for noncarnivores .
These values suggest that further studies including a larger number of communities would eventually lead to values of " normal " Hg concentration in the Amazonian Region quite above the limits suggested by the World Health Organization .
