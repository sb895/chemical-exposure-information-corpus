Between 1990 and 1994 , samples of three shellfish species ( i.e. blue crab , Callinectes sapidus;crayfish , Procambarus acutis ; and river shrimp , Macrobrachium ohionii ) and 16 fish species and were collected at six sites along the lower Mississippi River by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality , Office of Water Resources in coordination with the US Environmental Protection Agency .
The fish species included : bigmouth buffalo ( Ictiobus cyanellus ) ; blue catfish ( Ictalurus furcatus ) ; carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) ; channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) ; cobia ( Rachycentron canadum ) ; flathead catfish ( Pylodictis olivaris ) ; freshwater drum ( Aplodinotus grunniens ) ; largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) ; long nose gar ( Lepisosteus osseus ) ; red drum ( Sciaenops ocellatus ) ; red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus ) ; smallmouth buffalo ( Ictiobus bubalus ) ; spotted gar ( Lepisosteus oculatus ) ; striped bass ( Morone saxatilis ) ; white bass ( Morone chrysops ) ; and white crappie ( Pomoxis annularis ) .
Organic compound and heavy metal concentrations were measured in 161 composite fish tissue samples where each composite included three to 10 individual fish .
Nineteen chemicals , found at measurable levels in sample tissues , were used in calculations of lifetime excess cancer and non-cancer risks due to fish consumption .
We calculated : 574 chemical-specific cancer risks ; 41 total cancer risks ; and 697 margins of exposure based on a consumption rate of one 8-ounce meal per week ( 0.032 kg/day ) , a body weight of 70 kg and reported cancer potency factors and reference doses .
We identified nine species of concern ( blue catfish , carp , channel catfish , cobia , crayfish , flathead catfish , red drum , spotted gar and striped bass ) based on total cancer risk greater than 10(-4) or margin of exposure greater than 1 , and whether or not samples collected in subsequent years resulted in lower risks .
The compounds primarily responsible for the elevated risks were aldrin , dieldrin , alpha-benzene hexachloride , gamma-benzene hexachloride , heptachlor epoxide , arsenic and mercury .
