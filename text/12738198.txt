An investigation of arsenic , copper , nickel , manganese , zinc and selenium concentration in foodstuffs and drinking water , collected from 34 families and estimation of the average daily dietary intake were carried out in the arsenic-affected areas of the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , Murshidabad district , West Bengal where arsenic-contaminated groundwater ( mean : 0.11 mg/l , n=34 ) is the main source for drinking .
The shallow large diameter tubewells , installed for agricultural irrigation contain an appreciable amount of arsenic ( mean : 0.094 mg/l , n=10 ) .
So some arsenic can be expected in the food chain and food cultivated in this area .
Most of the individual food composites contain a considerable amount of arsenic .
The mean arsenic levels in food categories are vegetables ( 20.9 and 21.2 microg/kg ) , cereals and bakery goods ( 130 and 179 microg/kg ) and spices ( 133 and 202 microg/kg ) for the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively .
For all other heavy metals , the observed mean concentration values are mostly in good agreement with the reported values around the world ( except higher zinc in cereals ) .
The provisional tolerable daily intake value of inorganic arsenic microg/kg body wt./day ) is : for adult males ( 11.8 and 9.4 ) ; adult females ( 13.9 and 11 ) ; and children ( 15.3 and 12 ) in the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively ( according to FAO/WHO report , the value is 2.1 microg/kg body wt./day ) .
According to WHO , intake of 1.0 mg of inorganic arsenic per day may give rise to skin lesions within a few years .
The average daily dietary intake of copper , nickel and manganese is high , whereas for zinc , the value is low ( for adult males : 8.34 and 10.2 mg/day ; adult females : 8.26 and 10.3 mg/day ; and children : 4.59 and 5.66 mg/day ) in the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively , compared to the recommended dietary allowance of zinc for adult males , adult females and children ( 15 , 12 and 10 mg/day , respectively ) .
The average daily dietary intake of selenium microg/kg body wt./day ) is on the lower side for the children ( 1.07 and 1.22 ) , comparable for the adult males ( 0.81 and 0.95 ) and slightly on the higher side for the adult females ( 1.08 and 1.26 ) , compared to the recommended value ( 1.7 and 0.9 microg/kg body wt./day for infants and adults , respectively ) .
