Human exposure to perfluorinated compounds is a worldwide phenomenon ; however , routes of human exposure to these compounds have not been well-characterized .
Fifty-four solid food composite samples collected as part of the Canadian Total Diet Study ( TDS ) were analyzed for perfluorocarboxylates and perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) using a methanol extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method .
Foods analyzed included fish and seafood , meat , poultry , frozen entrÃ©es , fast food , and microwave popcorn collected from 1992 to 2004 and prepared as for consumption .
Nine composites contained detectable levels of perfluorinated compounds-four meat-containing , three fish and shellfish , one fast food , and one microwave popcorn .
PFOS and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) were detected the most frequently ; concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 4.5 ng/g .
The average dietary intake of total perfluorocarboxylates and PFOS for Canadians was estimated to be 250 ng/day , using results from the 2004 TDS composites .
A comparison with intakes of perfluorocarboxylates and PFOS via other routes ( air , water , dust , treated carpeting , and apparel ) suggested that diet is an important source of these compounds .
There was a substantial margin of exposure between the toxicological points of reference and the magnitude of dietary intake of perfluorinated compounds for Canadians >/= 12 years old .
