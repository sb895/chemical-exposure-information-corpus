This study investigated the relationships of steroid and thyroid hormones with total noncoplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , total toxic equivalents ( TEQs ) from dioxins-like organochlorines , and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene ( DDE ) in 56 male frequent and infrequent Great Lakes sport caught fish consumers .
Significant negative associations were found for triiodothyronine ( T3 ) , thyroxine ( T4 ) , thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , and sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG)-bound testosterone with PCBs , for TSH with total TEQs , and for estrone sulfate with DDE , adjusting for age , body mass index , and medication use .
Follicle-stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone , free testosterone , and SHBG were not significantly associated with organochlorines .
Models that accounted for exposure to both PCBs and TEQs predicted T4 , estrone sulfate , and SHBG-bound testosterone better than models that included either PCBs or TEQs alone , with the lowest hormone levels occurring in the participants with both higher PCB levels and lower TEQ levels .
These data suggest that exposure to PCBs , dioxin-like organochlorines , and DDE , alone and potentially in combination , may be associated with effects on the endocrine system in adult males .
Further studies should help delineate specific exposure effects and effects of exposures to other common environmental contaminants alone and in combination with PCBs .
