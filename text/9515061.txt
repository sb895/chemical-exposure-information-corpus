Population-based studies of hospital usage have been used to identify the ongoing adverse impacts of photochemical air pollutants on respiratory health .
In this study we examined the relationship between the number of daily emergency room ( ER ) visits for respiratory illnesses ( 25 hospitals ) and outdoor air pollution in Montreal , Quebec ( June-August , 1989-1990 ) .
Air pollutants measured included 1- and 8-h maximum ozone ( O3 ) and estimated particulate matter < 2.5 microns in aerometric diameter ( PM2.5 ) .
Seasonal and day-of-week trends , autocorrelation , temperature , and relative humidity were controlled for in-time series regressions .
Although O3 levels never exceeded the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard ( NAAQS ) of 120 ppb ( maximum day , 106 ppb ) , statistically significant ( P < 0.01 ) relationships were found between respiratory ER visits for patients over the age of 64 and both 1- and 8-h maximum O3 measured 1 day prior to the ER visit day during the 1989 summer : ER visits were 18.7% higher than average ( 95% Cl , 6.5-30.9% ) for a mean increase of 44 ppb O3 ( 1-h maximum ) , and 21.8% higher than average ( 95% Cl , 9.7-33.8% ) for a mean increase of 38 ppb O3 ( 8-h maximum ) .
There was an association between respiratory ER visits for the elderly and estimated PM2.5 lagged 1 day ( 0.1 visit/microgram/m3 PM2.5 , P < 0.07 ) , but this was confounded by both temperature and O3 .
The only finding for a reference group of nonrespiratory conditions was an inverse association between ER visits for infants and O3 , but this was confounded by weather .
These findings confirm the impression that while air quality standards may protect the respiratory health of the general population , this is not the case for susceptible subgroups such as the elderly .
