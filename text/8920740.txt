The reliability of human scalp hair as an indicator of mercury vapour exposure is contentious .
In this study mercury concentrations in hair were compared with those in blood and urine of 20 dental students during their first " occupational " exposure to mercury vapour .
Samples were collected before , at the end of the technical course of operating dentistry which lasted 6 weeks , and 3 months later .
Mercury was measured by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry .
In all biological media studied , mercury levels significantly ( P < 0.05 ) reflected exposure to mercury vapour .
After the time period without exposure mercury content decreased .
Hair mercury levels were correlated to those in erythrocytes at sampling times 1 and 3 ( r = 0.686 and r = 0.492 ) and to the frequency of fish consumption at sampling time 1 .
It is concluded that hair may be used as an indicator of internal uptake of mercury provided that it was not externally exposed to mercury vapour .
In cases of occupational exposure to mercury vapour , hair is an useful tool for monitoring external exposure .
