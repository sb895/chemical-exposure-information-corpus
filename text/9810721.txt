The preservation of lead within human tissue makes it possible to monitor long-term exposure to the element and to model changing sources of lead pollution throughout the lifetime of an individual .
Dental tissues have recently been shown to be particularly useful for this purpose .
Enamel , for instance , forms at known stages of life and is chemically stable in vivo whereas dentine is remodelled in a predictable fashion .
The relative stability of enamel is reflected in its excellent post-mortem preservation .
This raises the possibility of using historical or archaeological material to reconstruct long-term trends and establish baseline data relating to exposure among pre-industrial or even prehistoric populations .
The use of archaeological material is currently problematic , however , because of the site-specific nature of diagenesis and incomplete understanding of its chemistry , particularly in respect of lead uptake into dental tissue from the burial environment .
A detailed study of lead distribution within both ancient and modern human teeth is presented .
Conclusions are drawn on the pattern of lead distribution resulting from tissue formation and the manner of its alteration in the burial environment .
In particular , attention is drawn to a consistent enrichment of lead within the outer 30 microns of the enamel of both ancient and modern teeth which appears to be unrelated to diagenesis .
The implications for current approaches to long-term monitoring and for the reconstruction of historical and archaeological exposure patterns are discussed .
