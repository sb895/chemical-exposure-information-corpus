OBJECTIVE To compare chronic respiratory symptoms , fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( FENO ) , and lung function between Robusta and Arabica coffee workers and a control group .
METHODS Chronic respiratory symptoms were assessed by a questionnaire ( n = 138 coffee workers and n = 120 controls ) .
The FENO was measured by NIOX MINO device ( Aerocrine AB , Solna , Sweden ) .
Lung function was examined by a portable spirometer .
RESULTS Coffee workers had higher prevalence of chronic respiratory and asthma symptoms than controls .
Robusta coffee workers were exposed to higher levels of endotoxin and had more asthma symptoms than Arabica coffee workers ( 38% vs. 18% ) .
Coffee workers had reduced lung function associated with cumulative exposure to total dust and endotoxin .
CONCLUSION Work in coffee factories is associated with small but significant lung function impairment .
These changes were not associated with the level of FENO .
