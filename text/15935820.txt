Benzene ( B ) is a typical micro-pollutant present in air , especially urban air .
In this study a possible correlation between personal benzene exposure and S-phenylmercapturic acid ( S-PMA ) as a biomarker of internal dose was evaluated in a cohort of traffic policemen .
The results confirm that S-PMA is significantly correlated to benzene measured in personal air .
B and S-PMA were analyzed considering seasonality , work quarters , time spent indoors , outdoors , and directing traffic , but no significant differences were recorded .
