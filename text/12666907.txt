Human adipose samples collected in Tokyo , Japan in 1970 and 2000 were analyzed for the presence of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PBDDs ) , dibenzofurans ( PBDFs ) , and diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , and the concentrations in the two groups were compared .
As far as we know , the concentrations of the PBDD/Fs in adipose tissue from the general Japanese population are reported for the first time .
Three PBDD/F congeners were found in the following adipose tissues : 2,3,7,8-TeBDD , 2,3,7,8-TeBDF , and 2,3,4,7,8-PeBDF .
The median concentrations ( ranges ) of three PBDD/Fs in 1970 and 2000 were 5.1 ( 3.4-8.3 ) and 3.4 ( 1.9-5.3 ) pg/g lipid wt ( l.w. ) , respectively .
For PBDEs , seven PBDE congeners were determined in the following samples : 2,4,4'-tribromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-28 ) , 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-47 ) , 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-99 ) , 2,2',4,4',6-pentabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-100 ) , 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-153 ) , 2,2',4,4',5',6-hexabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-154 ) , and 2,2',3,4,4',5',6-heptabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-183 ) .
Median concentrations ( ranges ) of PBDEs showed a significant increase from 29.2 ( 6.8-78.4 ) pg/g l.w. in 1970 to 1288 ( 466-2,753 ) pg/g l.w. in 2000 .
BDE-47 , the major congener of PBDEs , was 56.2% and 35.6% of the total in 1970 and 2000 , respectively , whereas the BDE-153 was < 1% and 29.7% of the total in 1970 and 2000 , respectively .
This may indicate that the source of PBDEs had changed during this period .
Further analysis of archived human samples from 1970 to 2000 is needed to describe the details of the contamination trends of PBDD/Fs and PBDEs in the Japanese population .
Furthermore , PBDD/F monitoring , particularly 2,3,7,8-TeBDD and 2,3,7,8-TeBDF , may give more toxicological information based on TeCDD toxic equivalents ( TEQs ) .
