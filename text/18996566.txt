The present study is aimed to assess persistent organic halogenated pollutants in humans living in Bangladesh .
The results are compared to other similar studies in the region and globally .
Human blood plasma were collected from groups of men and women with different occupations , i.e. being students , garment industry workers , employees at the Power Development Board ( PDB ) , all groups in Dhaka , fishermen and fishermen wife's from Dhaka and another group from Barisal district .
The plasma was analysed for hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , the hexachlorocyclohexane isomers , alpha-HCH , beta-HCH , gamma-HCH and delta-HCH , the DDT group of chemicals , chlordane compounds , trans-chlordane , cis-chlordane , oxychlordane , trans-nonachlor , trans-heptachlorepoxide , methoxychlor and mirex .
The most abundant contaminant , in all groups studied , p,p'-DDE is dominating , with p,p'-DDT/Sigma DDT ratios indicating recent and ongoing DDT exposure .
Among the other pesticides analysed beta-HCH is the most abundant indicating the use of technical HCH products instead of Lindane ( gamma-HCH ) .
While the Sigma DDT is present in the low ppm range the beta-HCH is detected in up to approx. 400 ppb , lipid basis .
The beta-HCH is most abundant in the groups of students .
In contrast to the pesticides analysed very low concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) are present in all study groups , with e.g .
CB-153 in the range of 5-30 ng g(-1) fat .
The concentrations of the DDT group of chemical differ significantly between fishermen and fishermen's wives living and working in the Dhaka area versus those living and working in Barisal .
Also , fishermen and their wives had significantly different concentrations of DDT compared to garment industry workers .
