AIMS Bisphenol A ( BPA)-based dental composites have commonly been used to fill dental cavities or seal pits and fissures on teeth .
However , epidemiological evidence with regard to the BPA exposure from dental composites among children has rarely been reported .
This study investigated whether there is a relationship between the BPA concentration in urine and the presence of composite restorations and sealants among South Korean children .
METHODS Oral examinations and urine sample analyses were conducted on a total of 495 children aged 8-9 years .
We classified the participants into four groups by the number of resin composites and sealant surfaces ( 0 , 1-5 , 6-10 and 11+ ) .
RESULTS BPA concentrations in urine were higher in children with 11 or more surfaces restored with sealants and resin composites than in those with zero restored surfaces , although no difference was seen in the group with 1-10 surfaces .
After adjusting for gender and age , the urinary BPA concentration in children with 11 or more resin composite surfaces was 2.67 \u03bcg/g creatinine , which was higher than the concentration found in those with no filling surfaces ( P < 0.01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Having many dental composite filling surfaces on teeth may increase the urinary BPA concentration in children .
