The aim of this study was to measure the concentrations of lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , copper ( Cu ) , iron ( Fe ) , and zinc ( Zn ) in deciduous teeth from children living in Jordan and to investigate the affecting factors .
Deciduous teeth samples ( n = 320 , without fillings ) were collected from 5- to 12-year-old children and analyzed for Pb , Cd , Cu , Fe , and Zn using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry .
A questionnaire was used to gather information on each child , such as sex , age , tooth type ( incisors , canines , and molars ) , tooth position within the mouth ( upper or lower jaw ) , caries status , presence of amalgam fillings inside the mouth , type of drinking water ( tap water , home purified water , and plant purified water ) , and zone of residence ( close to or far from heavy traffic roads ) .
The mean concentrations of Pb , Cd , Cu , Fe , and Zn were 30.26 , 0.55 , 6.23 , 34.72 , and 128.21 \u03bcg/g , respectively .
Our results indicate that there is a clear relation between the concentrations of the metals analyzed in this study and tooth type , tooth position within the mouth , caries status , presence of amalgam fillings inside the mouth , and type of drinking water .
No significant differences in the concentrations of the five metals analyzed were observed due to sex .
Our results also show that no significant difference among Pb , Cd , Cu , Fe , and Zn concentrations and age among the ages of 5-6 , 7-8 , 9-10 , and 11-12 , except for Pb , which decreases at age 11-12 .
