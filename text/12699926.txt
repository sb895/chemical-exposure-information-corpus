The concentrations of HCB , alpha- , beta- and gamma-HCH , 3 chlordanes ( CHLs ) , p,p'-DDE , p,p'-DDD , p,p'-DDT , and 30 PCBs ( polychlorinated biphenyls ) were determined in 140 human milk samples from Kargopol ( n=19 ) , Severodvinsk ( n=50 ) , Arkhangelsk ( n=51 ) and Naryan-Mar ( n=20 ) .
Pooled samples were used for determination of three toxaphenes ( chlorobornanes , CHBs ) .
The concentrations of HCB , beta-HCH and p,p'-DDE in Russian human milk were 2 , 10 and 3 times higher than corresponding levels in Norway , respectively , while concentrations of sum-PCBs and sum-TEQs ( toxic equivalent quantities ) of the mono-ortho substituted PCBs were in the same range as corresponding levels in Norway .
The PCB-156 contributed most to the sum-TEQs .
Highest mean concentrations of HCB ( 129 microg/kg milk fat ) and sum-PCBs ( 458 microg/kg milk fat ) were detected in Naryan-Mar , while highest mean concentrations of sum-HCHs ( 408 microg/kg milk fat ) , sum-CHLs ( 48 microg/kg milk fat ) , sum-DDTs ( 1392 microg/kg milk fat ) and sum-toxaphenes ( 13 microg/kg milk fat ) were detected in Arkhangelsk .
An eastward geographic trend of increasing ratios of alpha/beta-HCH , gamma/beta-HCH , p,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDE and PCB-180/28 was observed .
In all areas the levels of sum-HCHs decreased with parity ( number of children born ) .
Considerable variation in levels of the analysed organochlorines ( OCs ) was found in all the studied areas .
Breast milk from mothers nursing their second or third child ( multiparas ) in Naryan-Mar showed a significant different PCB profile compared to mothers giving birth to their first child ( primiparas ) from the same area and to primi- and multiparas in the other areas .
Both p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT showed a significant , but weak , negative correlation with the infants birth weight .
