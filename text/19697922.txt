Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) have been detected in humans worldwide and are of health concern .
This study measured the concentration of PFCs in composite samples collected for the 1998 Health Canada Total Diet Study and estimated dietary exposure for the Canadian population ( older than 12 years of age ) using previously collected dietary data ( n = 1721 ) .
PFCs were detected in 8 samples including processed meats , preprepared foods , and peppers with a range of concentrations from 0.48 to 5.01 ng g(-1) ( wet weight). 6:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylate ( FTUCA ) was detected in cold cuts at a concentration of 1.26 ng g(-1) .
Mean daily PFC exposure estimates ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 ng ( kg of body weight)(-1 ) .
Perfluorinated carboxylates ( PFCA C(7)-C(11) ) contributed more to PFC exposure than either perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) or FTUCA .
Total PFCAs in cakes and cookies , lunchmeats , and green vegetables were the main contributors to dietary exposure , although these exposure levels were below the provisional tolerable daily intake provided by the German Drinking Water Commission .
Dietary exposure to total PFCs has not changed over time , although the contribution of PFOS to total PFC exposure may have increased between 1998 and 2004 .
Further research on the sources of contamination of processed and preprepared foods is required .
Dietary exposure to PFCs among Canadians poses minimal health risks based on current toxicological information .
