Mercury ( Hg ) contamination in the Brazilian Amazon constitutes a serious environmental and public health issue .
This study is part of the CARUSO Project , which uses an ecosystem approach to human health to examine the sources , transmission , and effects of Hg in the Brazilian Amazon , with a view to developing preventive intervention strategy .
To date , studies have focused on measures of Hg exposure through fish consumption in relation to health effects ; little attention has been given to quality of life ( QoL ) .
The objective of this study was to examine the relations between QoL and health perceptions , Hg exposure , sociodemographics , living conditions , and lifestyle in communities along the Tapajós River .
A total of 456 adults from 13 villages were interviewed and provided hair samples for Hg analysis .
Results showed that perceptions of QoL and health are relatively positive , despite elevated Hg exposure .
Logistic regression analyses showed that a positive perception of QoL was associated with the absence of chronic illnesses , not smoking , fruit consumption , residing on the banks of the Tapajós , and living in an in-migrants ' community .
The positive perception of health was associated with younger age , the absence of reported symptoms of chronic illnesses , and drinking alcoholic beverages .
Cluster analysis revealed that the group that reported the highest QoL had a traditional lifestyle , involving daily fishing and high fish consumption .
However , this traditional lifestyle is associated with elevated Hg levels and early reported symptoms potentially linked to Hg exposure .
These findings underline the importance of understanding the factors underlying QoL to develop adequate strategies to reduce Hg exposure and promote well-being .
