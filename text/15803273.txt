Bisphenol-A diglycidylether methacrylate ( Bis-GMA ) , which is synthesized from bisphenol-A ( BPA ) , a compound with exogenous endocrine disrupter action , is widely used as a dental material .
During clinical filling with sealants and composite resins , the compounds are solidified by polymerization and then used .
However , it has been noted that unpolymerized monomers may become dissolved in saliva .
In this study using a competitive ELISA system , we investigated the changes in the BPA concentration in saliva after restoration with composite resins .
Commercial composite resins from nine companies were tested .
Mixed saliva was collected from 21 subjects .
Based on the dynamics of salivary BPA detected by this ELISA system , we concluded that several tens to 100 ng/ml of BPA were contained in saliva after filling teeth with composite resin but that sufficient gargling can remove it from the oral cavity .
Our data suggest that sufficient gargling after treatment is important for risk management .
