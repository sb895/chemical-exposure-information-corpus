A massive increase in gold mining in the Amazon region of Brazil has led to an enormous discharge of metallic mercury into the aquatic ecosystem .
To investigate the dispersion , total and inorganic mercury concentrations were measured in water , fish and animal tissues , and in blood , urine and hair from members of the local populations .
Mercury concentrations in river water , sediments and fish were high compared with those of non-contaminated areas .
Cattle and pigs kept in the area and with access to the contaminated rivers had concentrations of mercury of 0.1-1.28 micrograms/g and 11.7-15.7 micrograms/l in hair and blood , respectively .
These results are approximately twice those measured in specimens from control animals .
Mean mercury concentrations in blood , urine and hair of residents were increased at 11.4 micrograms/l , 22.8 micrograms/l and 4.3 micrograms/g , respectively , and the urine mercury of workers from the gold mining sites were up to 155 micrograms/l .
The results demonstrate widespread contamination of the environment by mercury with transfer of the metal to fish and animals used for food , and into the inhabitants of the region .
Further investigations for possible adverse health effects need to be undertaken .
