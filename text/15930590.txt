Hair samples of 134 school children ( 12-14 yr old ) living in three residential zones in the vicinity of a new hazardous waste incinerator ( HWI ) ( Constanti , Tarragona County , Catalonia , Spain ) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) for arsenic ( As ) , beryllium ( Be ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , chromium ( Cr ) , mercury ( Hg ) , manganese ( Mn ) , nickel ( Ni ) , lead ( Pb ) , tin ( Sn ) , thallium ( Tl ) , and vanadium ( V ) concentrations .
These concentrations were compared with those obtained in a baseline survey performed in the same area during the period of construction of the HWI .
Current mean concentrations ranged from values under the respective limit of detection ( As , Be , Cd , Tl , and V ) to 0.70 and 0.86 microg/g for Hg and Pb , respectively .
In comparison to the baseline survey , the levels of Cr , Mn , Ni , Pb , and Sn showed a significant reduction , whereas Hg concentrations were similar .
No significant differences were observed according to the sex of the children .
However , some differences were noted , especially for Pb and Cr , with respect to the specific zone of residence .
In general terms , the current metal levels in hair of school children are similar or even lower than those recently reported for a number of industrial and residential areas of various regions and countries .
