Mercury ( Hg ) is a ubiquitous heavy metal that can negatively affect human health ; however , few studies have examined the impact of prenatal low-level Hg exposure on fetal growth .
We investigated prenatal exposure levels of Hg and the relationship between Hg levels and neonatal anthropometrics , including birth weight , length , and head circumference .
A total of 258 mother-infant pairs were recruited from a rural community located on the southern coastal area of Laizhou Bay of the Bohai Sea in northern China between September 2010 and December 2011 .
We measured maternal and cord whole blood Hg levels and examined their association with neonatal anthropometrics .
The geometric means ( GMs ) of Hg in maternal and cord whole blood were 0.84\u03bcgL(-1) and 1.46\u03bcgL(-1) , respectively .
The Hg exposure levels in our study population were much lower than those reported in previous domestic studies .
No significant associations were found between maternal or cord blood Hg levels and birth weight , length , and head circumference .
However , our results should be interpreted with caution given the high toxicity of Hg and its persistence in the body .
Studies focusing on long-term adverse outcomes are needed to further examine the cumulative effects of low-level Hg exposure .
