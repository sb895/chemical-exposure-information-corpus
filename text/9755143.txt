Residents living near a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility expressed concern to health officials over chemical emissions from the plant .
Environmental monitoring of ambient air near the plant indicated the presence of toluene diisocyanate ( TDI ) , which was used in foam production .
Health officials collected blood samples from 113 residents and analyzed the blood sera for antibodies to TDI and related diisocyanates .
Ten of the 113 residents ( 9% ) had elevated levels of IgG or IgE antibodies specific for one or more diisocyanates .
Exposure histories were taken from antibody-positive individuals to identify possible occupational exposure to TDI or the use of diisocyanate-containing consumer products .
Exposure to TDI in ambient air may be responsible for the positive antibody responses detected in some residents of the community .
