A field survey was conducted to investigate the metal contamination in soils and vegetables , and to evaluate the possible health risks to local population through foodchain transfer near a smelter in Nanning , southern China .
Contamination levels in soils and vegetables with cadmium ( Cd ) , lead ( Pb ) , zinc ( Zn ) and copper ( Cu ) were measured , and transfer factors ( TF ) from soils to vegetable plants and its health risk ( risk index , RI ) were calculated accordingly .
Results showed that both soils and vegetables from villages 1 and 2 ( V1 and V2 , 1500 m and 500 m from the smelter ) were heavily contaminated , compared to a village 50 km from the smelter .
Geometric mean of Cd and Pb concentrations in vegetables for V1 and V2 , respectively , were 0.15 and 0.24 mg Cd kg(-1) and 0.45 and 0.38 mg Pb kg(-1) ( on fresh weight basis ) .
Oral intake of Cd and Pb through vegetables poses high health risk to local residents .
Risk indices for V1 and V2 , respectively , were 3.87 and 7.42 for Cd , and 1.44 and 13.5 for Pb .
The complexity of metal contamination and their health risks are also discussed .
