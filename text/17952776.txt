High levels of urinary arsenic have been reported among residents of an area of southern Thailand where many households have shallow wells heavily contaminated with arsenic .
However , the finding that very few of the residents in this area have used contaminated shallow-well water for drinking or cooking in the last 10 years prompted this investigation .
The aim was to identify the uses of shallow-well water by adult residents that were related to a positive association between shallow-well water and urinary arsenic levels .
Information on shallow-well water use for all personal and domestic purposes was obtained and arsenic levels of household shallow-well water and urine ( after refraining from seafood for 2 days ) were measured .
Urinary and shallow-well water arsenic levels were strongly positively associated among residents who regularly used shallow-well water for bathing ( including washing face , hair , hands and feet ) but not among residents regularly using arsenic-safe water for bathing or regularly using shallow-well water for other purposes , such as brushing teeth , domestic cleaning or washing food and utensils .
The findings suggest that appreciable transdermal absorption of arsenic is possible and that successful abatement of human contamination with arsenic may require the provision of arsenic-safe water , not only for consumption but also for personal hygiene purposes .
