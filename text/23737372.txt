BACKGROUND Coal mine dust exposure can cause both pneumoconiosis and chronic airflow limitation .
The contributions of various pathophysiologic mechanisms to dust-related lung function decrements remain unclear .
METHODS Clinical and physiological findings were assessed for 15 underground coal miners who had demonstrated accelerated FEV1 losses ( decliners ) over 6-18 years .
Decliners ' findings were evaluated in comparison to a group of 11 miners who had shown relatively stable lung function ( referents ) during the same period .
RESULTS At follow-up examination , the decliners showed significantly greater mean airway resistance ( 10.47 vs. 6.78 cmH2 O/L/s ; P = 0.05 ) and more air trapping ( RV/TLC = 37.5 vs. 29.1% ; P < 0.01 ) compared to the referents .
Decliners also demonstrated more evidence of small airways dysfunction and tended to have more bronchospasm than the referent group .
Total lung capacity , lung compliance , diffusing capacity , and chest radiography did not differ significantly between the two groups .
After cessation of mine dust exposures , the decliners ' mean rate of FEV1 loss normalized .
CONCLUSION In a series of working coal miners , accelerated lung function declines were associated with air trapping and evidence of small airways dysfunction .
A preventive benefit from controlling dust exposures was suggested .
