The presence of organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) in biological and environmental samples has been studied for decades in many countries .
Nonetheless , studies in Latin American countries like Colombia have been scarce .
Determining the presence of OCPs in breast milk will be of relevance to assess exposures , potential health risks , and for surveillance among Latin American populations .
Thirty-two breast-feeding mothers were selected to voluntarily participate in the study .
Breast milk samples were analyzed for 10 OCPs ( \u03b1- , \u03b2- , \u03b3- , \u03b4-HCH , Heptachlor , \u03b1- , \u03b3-Chlordane , 4,4 ' DDT , 4,4 ' DDE , 4,4 ' DDD ) .
Milk samples were analyzed using liquid-liquid extraction , followed by sulfuric acid clean-up , and quantified using GC/\u03bcECD .
Results were confirmed by GC/MS .
OCPs concentrations were normalized using fat content .
In all but one sample , 4,4 ' DDE was quantified in concentrations ranging between<17 and 14948 ng g(-1) ( ng of OCP per g of lipids ) , with a mean value of 203 ng g(-1) .
One woman had 4,4 ' DDE concentrations that were orders of magnitude above the average concentrations observed worldwide .
Concentrations of 4,4 ' DDE in a second breast milk sample collected in a different time period of lactation from a sub-group of 13 women from the original participants , showed no statistically significant difference with the concentrations found in the first sample .
Based on the results obtained from the Persistent Organic Pollutants Global Monitoring Plan report of 2009 of the Stockholm Convention , Colombia ranks fourth from bottom to top in terms of 4,4 ' DDE average concentrations .
