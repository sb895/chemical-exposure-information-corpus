Contaminated soil particles and food are established routes of exposure .
We investigated the relations between biomarkers of exposure to cadmium and lead , and the metal loading rates in house dust in the adult residents of an area with a soil cadmium concentration of > or = 3 mg/kg ( n=268 ) and a reference area ( n=205 ) .
We determined the metal concentrations in house dust allowed to settle for 3 months in Petri dishes placed in the participants ' bedrooms .
The continuously distributed vegetable index was the first principal component derived from the metal concentrations in six different vegetables .
The biomarkers of exposure ( blood cadmium 9.2 vs. 6.2 nmol/L ; 24-h urinary cadmium 10.5 vs. 7.0 nmol ; blood lead 0.31 vs. 0.24 micromol/L ) , the loading rates of cadmium and lead in house dust ( 0.29 vs. 0.12 and 7.52 vs. 3.62 ng/cm(2)/92 days ) , and the vegetable indexes ( 0.31 vs. -0.44 and 0.13 vs. -0.29 standardized units ) were significantly higher in the contaminated area .
A two-fold increase in the metal loading rate in house dust was associated with increases ( P<0.001 ) in blood cadmium ( +2.3% ) , 24-h urinary cadmium ( +3.0% ) , and blood lead ( +2.0% ) , independent of the vegetable index and other covariates .
The estimated effect sizes on the biomarkers of internal exposure were three times greater for house dust than vegetables .
In conclusion , in the adult population , house dust is potentially an important route of exposure to heavy metals in areas with contaminated soils , and should be incorporated in the assessment of health risks .
