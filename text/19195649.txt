Ancient human hair specimens can shed light on the extent of pre-historic exposures to methylmercury and provide valuable comparison data with current-day exposures , particularly for Indigenous Peoples who continue to rely upon local traditional food resources .
Human hair from ancient Aleutian Island Native remains were tested for total and methylmercury ( Hg , MeHg ) and were radiocarbon dated .
The remains were approximately 500 years old ( 1450 A.D. ) .
For four adults , the mean and median total hair mercury concentration was 5.8 ppm ( SD=0.9 ) .
In contrast , MeHg concentrations were lower with a mean of 1.2 ppm ( SD=1.8 ) and a median of 0.54 ppm ( 0.12-3.86 ) .
For the five infants , the mean and median MeHg level was 1.2 ppm ( SD=1.8 ) and 0.20 ppm ( 0.007-4.61 ) , respectively .
Segmental analyses showed variations in MeHg concentrations in 1-cm segments , consistent with fluctuations in naturally occurring exposure to mercury through dietary sources .
The levels are comparable to or lower than those found in fish and marine mammal-eating populations today who rely far less on subsistence food than pre-historic humans .
The findings are , therefore , compatible with increased anthropogenic release of trace metals during the past several centuries .
