Drinking water is a potential source of toxic contaminant and it is well known that water intake on a body weight basis decreases rapidly with increasing age .
Nevertheless , few studies have been conducted on water intake of very young infants who might be particularly sensitive to some toxic chemicals .
The objective of this study was to describe the mean and distribution of total water intake of 2-month old infants living in agricultural areas .
Mothers ( n=642 ) of 8 to 9 week old infants were interviewed by phone to evaluate their feeding practice , including juice and cereal intake .
There were 393 infants ( 61% ) who drank some quantity of water and 278 ( 43% ) consumed formula reconstituted with water .
For formula-fed infants , the 10 , 50 and 90th percentiles of daily water intake were 79 , 112 , and 179 ml/kg respectively .
These values are much higher than the intake recommended by US EPA for infants under one year ( US EPA , 1997 ) .
This study demonstrates the importance of considering water distribution intake in very young infants who may be particularly susceptible to water contaminants .
