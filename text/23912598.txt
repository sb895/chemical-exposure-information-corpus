BACKGROUND Parabens are preservatives commonly used in personal care products , pharmaceuticals , and foods .
There is documented widespread human exposure to parabens , and some experimental data suggest that they act as estrogenic endocrine disruptors .
As far as we are aware , no epidemiologic studies have assessed female reproductive health effects in relation to paraben exposure .
OBJECTIVE We examined the association of urinary paraben concentrations with markers of ovarian reserve in a prospective cohort study of women seeking fertility treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts .
METHODS Measures of ovarian reserve were day-3 follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , antral follicle count ( AFC ) , and ovarian volume .
Paraben concentrations [ methylparaben ( MP ) , propylparaben ( PP ) , and butylparaben ( BP) ] were measured in spot urine samples collected prior to the assessment of outcome measures .
We used linear and Poisson regression models to estimate associations of urinary paraben concentrations ( in tertiles ) with ovarian reserve measures .
RESULTS Of the women enrolled in 2004-2010 , 192 had at least one ovarian reserve outcome measured ( mean age ± SD , 36.1 ± 4.5 years ; range , 21.0-46.7 years ) .
MP and PP were detected in > 99% of urine samples and BP in > 75% .
We found a suggestive trend of lower AFC with increasing urinary PP tertiles [ mean percent change ( 95% CI ) for tertiles 2 and 3 compared with tertile 1 , respectively , were -5.0% ( -23.7 , 18.4 ) and -16.3% ( -30.8 , 1.3 ) ; trend p-value ( ptrend ) = 0.07 ] as well as higher day-3 FSH with higher urinary PP tertiles [ mean change ( 95% CI ) for tertiles 2 and 3 compared with tertile 1 were 1.16 IU/L ( -0.26 , 2.57 ) and 1.02 IU/L ( -0.40 , 2.43 ) ; ptrend = 0.16 ] .
We found no consistent evidence of associations between urinary MP or BP and day-3 FSH or AFC , or between urinary MP , PP , or BP and ovarian volume .
CONCLUSIONS PP may be associated with diminished ovarian reserve .
However , our results require confirmation in further studies .
