Heavy metal contamination in the street dust due to metal smelting in the industrial district of Huludao city was investigated .
Spatial distribution of Hg , Pb , Cd , Zn and Cu in the street dust was elucidated .
Meanwhile , noncancer effect and cancer effect of children and adults due to exposure to the street dust were estimated .
The maximum Hg , Pb , Cd , Zn and Cu contents in the street dust are 5.212 , 3903 , 726.2 , 79,869 , and 1532 mg kg(-1) , and respectively 141 , 181 , 6724 , 1257 and 77.4 times as high as the background values in soil .
The trends for Hg , Pb , Cd , Zn and Cu are similar with higher concentrations trending Huludao zinc plant ( HZP ) .
The exponential equation fits quite well for the variations of Pb , Cd , Zn and Cu contents with distance from the pollution sources , but not for Hg .
The biggest contribution to street dust is atmospheric deposition due to metal smelting , but traffic density makes slight contribution to heavy metal contamination .
According to the calculation on Hazard Index ( HI ) , in the case of noncancer effect , the ingestion of dust particles of children and adults in Huludao city appears to be the route of exposure to street dust that results in a higher risk for heavy metals , followed by dermal contact .
The inhalation of resuspended particles through the mouth and nose is almost negligible .
The inhalation of Hg vapour as the fourth exposure pathway to street dust is accounting for the main exposure .
Children are experiencing the potential health risk due to HI for Pb larger than safe level ( 1 ) and Cd close to 1 .
Besides , cancer risk of Cd due to inhalation exposure is low .
