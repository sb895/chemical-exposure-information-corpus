Concern about potential health impacts of low-level exposures to organophosphorus ( OP ) pesticides , bisphenol A ( BPA ) , and phthalates among the general population is increasing .
We measured levels of six dialkyl phosphate ( DAP ) metabolites of OP pesticides , a chlorpyrifos-specific metabolite ( 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol , TCPy ) , BPA , and 14 phthalate metabolites in urine samples of 100 pregnant women from the Generation R study , the Netherlands .
The unadjusted and creatinine-adjusted concentrations were reported , and compared to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and other studies .
In general , these metabolites were detectable in the urine of the women from the Generation R study and compared with other groups , they had relatively high-level exposures to OP pesticides and several phthalates but similar exposure to BPA .
The median concentrations of total dimethyl ( DM ) metabolites was 264.0 n mol/g creatinine ( Cr ) and of total DAP was 316.0 n mol/g Cr .
The median concentration of mono-ethyl phthalate ( MEP ) was 222.0 microg/g Cr ; the median concentrations of mono-isobutyl phthalate ( MiBP ) and mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MnBP ) were above 50 microg/g Cr .
The median concentrations of the three secondary metabolites of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) were greater than 20 microg/g Cr .
The data indicate that the Generation R study population provides a wide distribution of selected environmental exposures .
Reasons for the relatively high levels and possible health effects need investigation .
