BACKGROUND Asthma morbidity has been associated with ambient air pollutants in time-series and case-crossover studies .
In such study designs , threshold effects of air pollutants on asthma outcomes have been relatively unexplored , which are of potential interest for exploring concentration-response relationships .
METHODS This study analyzes daily data on the asthma morbidity experienced by the pediatric Medicaid population ( ages 2-18 years ) of Detroit , Michigan and concentrations of pollutants fine particles ( PM2.5 ) , CO , NO2 and SO2 for the 2004-2006 period , using both time-series and case-crossover designs .
We use a simple , testable and readily implementable profile likelihood-based approach to estimate threshold parameters in both designs .
RESULTS Evidence of significant increases in daily acute asthma events was found for SO2 and PM2.5 , and a significant threshold effect was estimated for PM2.5 at 13 and 11 \u03bcg m(-3) using generalized additive models and conditional logistic regression models , respectively .
Stronger effect sizes above the threshold were typically noted compared to standard linear relationship , e.g. , in the time series analysis , an interquartile range increase ( 9.2 \u03bcg m(-3) ) in PM2.5 ( 5-day-moving average ) had a risk ratio of 1.030 ( 95% CI : 1.001 , 1.061 ) in the generalized additive models , and 1.066 ( 95% CI : 1.031 , 1.102 ) in the threshold generalized additive models .
The corresponding estimates for the case-crossover design were 1.039 ( 95% CI : 1.013 , 1.066 ) in the conditional logistic regression , and 1.054 ( 95% CI : 1.023 , 1.086 ) in the threshold conditional logistic regression .
CONCLUSION This study indicates that the associations of SO2 and PM2.5 concentrations with asthma emergency department visits and hospitalizations , as well as the estimated PM2.5 threshold were fairly consistent across time-series and case-crossover analyses , and suggests that effect estimates based on linear models ( without thresholds ) may underestimate the true risk .
