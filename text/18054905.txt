We evaluated serum concentrations of five selected dioxin , furan , and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) congeners among 412 workers at a Midland , Michigan plant that manufactured trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) and formulated chlorophenol-based products .
We examined occupational indicators of exposure to these chlorophenols taking into account intrinsic factors such as age and body fat and potential environmental sources of exposure from consumption of local game and fish and other occupations .
All five congeners were significantly associated with age and body fat. 2378-TCDD serum concentrations were associated with trichlorophenol operations , total years employed at the plant , as well as working as a hazardous waste worker. 123678-H(6)CDD serum concentrations were related to occupational PCP exposure , chloracne , recent weight loss , eating local game , and working as a hazardous waste worker .
Serum concentrations of PCB126 were related to smoking ( inversely ) , and eating local fish or local game .
Other factors such as diet and jobs outside of the chlorophenol plant exposures had only a very minor impact on dioxin and furan concentrations in these workers .
