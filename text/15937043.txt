Excess or deficiency of natural trace elements has been implicated in the etiology of autism .
This study explores whether concentration levels of toxic metals in the hair of children with autism significantly differ from those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls .
In-hair concentration levels of antimony , uranium , arsenic , beryllium , mercury , cadmium , lead and aluminum from 40 boys with autism and 40 healthy boys were determined by Perkin-Elmer mass spectrometry .
The children with autism had significantly ( p<0.001 ) higher in-hair concentration levels of lead , mercury and uranium .
There was no significant difference between the two groups in the other five toxic elements .
The ratio between nutritional elements and toxic metals among children with autism was within the normal range .
The possible sources of the toxic metals are discussed .
Such testing is informative but at present the practical implications in terms of diagnosis and clinical management are limited .
