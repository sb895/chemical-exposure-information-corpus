Endometriosis among women of reproductive age can result in pain and infertility .
The objectives of this study were to test if there is a relation between endometriosis and serum dioxin concentrations as expressed by total toxic equivalence and serum total polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations among women patients at one Atlanta reproductive medicine clinic during 1998-1999 ; a secondary objective was to provide exposure data for individual congeners of these chemicals and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane ( p,p'-DDE ) in women in Atlanta .
Laparoscopy including biopsy and visualization of the peritoneal cavity , ovaries , outside of the fallopian tubes and uterus confirmed all endometriosis cases ( n=60 ) and confirmed 30 controls without endometriosis .
Other controls had an infertile partner ( n=27 ) or ovulation problems ( n=7 ) with no signs or symptoms of endometriosis .
All serum samples were analyzed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2003 .
Statistical analyses included Fisher's exact chi-square tests and logistic regression .
Models were presented for the full study sample and for the subset that included all cases ( n=60 ) and only controls ( n=30 ) with surgical confirmation of disease-free status .
Serum concentrations ( lipid-adjusted and non lipid-adjusted ) of analyzed exposure measures were low and similar for cases and controls and did not explain endometriosis in the study population .
