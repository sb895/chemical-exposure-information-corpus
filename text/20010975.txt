Flanders is densely populated with much industry and intensive farming .
Hormonal status of 14- to 15-year-old male adolescents was studied in relation to internal exposure to pollutants .
A total of 887 participants were selected as a random sample of the adolescents residing in the study areas .
Confounding factors and significant covariates were taken into account .
Serum levels of testosterone , free testosterone and estradiol , and the aromatase index showed significant positive associations with serum levels of marker polychlorobiphenyls ( sum of PCBs 138 , 153 , and 180 ) and of hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) and a negative association with urinary cadmium concentration .
Serum levels of estradiol also showed a positive association with serum levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( DDE ) .
A doubling of serum concentrations of marker PCBs and HCB and of urinary concentration of cadmium were , respectively , associated with an increase of 16.4% ( P<0.00001 ) and 16.6% ( P<0.001 ) and a decrease of 9.6% ( P<0.001 ) in serum testosterone concentration .
Similar findings were made after additional adjustment for concurrent exposures .
Associations between biological effects and internal exposures were , in terms of the regression coefficient , often stronger at exposures below the median .
Environmental exposures to pollutants resulting in " normal " levels of internal exposure were associated with quite substantial differences in hormone concentrations .
