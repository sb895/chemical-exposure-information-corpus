Contaminated food through dietary intake has become the main potential risk impacts on human health .
This study investigated concentrations of rare earth elements ( REEs ) in soil , vegetables , human hair and blood , and assessed human health risk through vegetables consumption in the vicinity of a large-scale mining area located in Hetian Town of Changting County , Fujian Province , Southeast China .
The results of the study included the following mean concentrations for total and bio-available REEs of 242.92 ± 68.98 ( 135.85-327.56)\u03bcg g(-1) and 118.59 ± 38.49 ( 57.89-158.96)\u03bcg g(-1) dry weight ( dw ) in agricultural soil , respectively , and total REEs of 3.58 ± 5.28 ( 0.07-64.42)\u03bcg g(-1) dw in vegetable samples .
Concentrations of total REEs in blood and hair collected from the local residents ranged from 424.76 to 1274.80 \u03bcg L(-1) with an average of 689.74 ± 254.25 \u03bcg L(-1) and from 0.06 to 1.59 \u03bcg g(-1) with an average of 0.48 ± 0.59 \u03bcg g(-1) of the study , respectively .
In addition , a significant correlation was observed between REEs in blood and corresponding soil samples ( R(2)=0.6556 , p<0.05 ) , however there was no correlation between REEs in hair and corresponding soils ( p>0.05 ) .
Mean concentrations of REEs of 2.85 ( 0.59-10.24)\u03bcg L(-1) in well water from the local households was 53-fold than that in the drinking water of Fuzhou city ( 0.054 \u03bcg L(-1) ) .
The health risk assessment indicated that vegetable consumption would not result in exceeding the safe values of estimate daily intake ( EDI ) REEs ( 100-110 \u03bcg kg(-1)d(-1) ) for adults and children , but attention should be paid to monitoring human beings health in such rare earth mining areas due to long-term exposure to high dose REEs from food consumptions .
