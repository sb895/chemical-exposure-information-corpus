The aim of the present study was to evaluate mercury and selenium concentrations in hair samples of reproductive age women from riverside communities of the Tapajós River basin .
We studied 19 pregnant and 21 non-pregnant women , 13 to 45 years old , living in the region for at least 2 years , and having a diet rich in fish .
The analysis of Se and total Hg were performed in the Instituto de Pesquisas Energéticas e Nucleares ( IPEN , São Paulo , Brazil ) by using a Varian AA220-FS atomic absorption spectrometer with a flow injection system .
There were no differences between the two groups - pregnant and non-pregnant -- concerning age ( 23.80 +/- 6.92 and 26.60 +/- 9.60 years old , respectively ) and residential time ( 20.21 +/- 8.30 and 22.20 +/- 10.90 years , respectively ) .
The geometric means and ranges for total Hg concentration were similar ( p > 0.05 ) : 8.25 microg/g ( 1.51-19.43 ) in pregnant and 9.39 microg/g ( 5.25-21.00 ) in non-pregnant women , respectively .
Total Hg concentrations were also similar in different gestational stages .
However , there was a significant difference between the two groups ( p < 0.05 , Student t test ) in relation to Se concentration : 0.61 microg/g ( 0.40-2.33 ) in pregnant and 2.46 microg/g ( 0.92-5.74 ) in non-pregnant women , respectively .
We concluded that Hg exposure levels in reproductive age women were only slightly higher than a provisional tolerable weekly intake of MeHg would provide , that Hg concentration in maternal hair samples was independent of gestational age , and that low Se concentration in pregnant women indicates high mineral consumption by fetal organism to satisfy their metabolic requirements raised during pregnancy , including as a protective mechanism for Hg cytotoxic effects .
