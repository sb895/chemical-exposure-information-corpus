OBJECTIVES Concentrations of 17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) and 18 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were measured in 11 varieties of food groups collected from retail market of Shenzhen , Guangdong province , China from 2004 to 2006 .
PCDD/Fs and PCBs dietary intake from varies food for the local population was estimated in the study .
METHODS Concentrations of 17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) and 12 dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) as well as 6 marker PCBs were measured in 11 varieties of food groups in total 110 food samples by isotope dilution HRGC/HRMS .
PCDD/Fs and PCBs dietary intake for local population was estimated using total WHO-TEQ concentration and different food consumption amount of the local population .
RESULTS The median WHO-TEQ concentrations of sum of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs varied from 0.0093 pg/g ( parts per trillion ) in vegetable to 9.89 pg/g in fish .
Fish was followed by egg 2.46 , chicken 1.73 , beef 0.94 , mutton 0.82 , duck 0.39 , pork 0.37 , milk powder 0.25 , vegetable oil 0.076 , cereals 0.022 pg/g and vegetable .
The monthly intake of PCDD/Fs and PCBs were 40.9 pg WHO-TEQ/kg b.w. for local population .
Sum of fish , livestock , and poultry contributed 77% to the Estimated Monthly Intake ( EMI ) in local population .
CONCLUSION Estimated dietary intake of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs for local population was below the provisional tolerable monthly intake(PTMI) set by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives ( JECFA ) .
