The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of nickel and cadmium in blood plasma of the people exposed to cement dust emissions and to investigate the effects of exposure period on the activities of Na+/K+ ATPase enzymes in their erythrocyte membranes .
The study was carried out on people living in Eski\u015fehir Cukurhisar rural area , located near a cement factory .
Blood samples of the individuals residing in this area were taken from 80 subjects ( 30 for control ) following a physical examination .
The analysis of plasma samples showed that nickel concentrations in subject group were found to be significantly higher than those of the control group ( p < 0.001 ) .
Cadmium concentrations were found to be within the reference values for both group and no difference was found between the subjects and controls ( p > 0.05 ) .
Furthermore , no correlation was observed between the levels of Na+/K+ ATPase activity in erythrocyte membranes of the subject group and the ages of people living in the region ( p > 0.05 , r = 0.133 ) .
It was also observed that nickel concentrations increased by age ( p < 0.001 , r = 0.646 ) while no effect was observed in means of cadmium .
Na+/K+ ATPase activities in the erythrocyte membranes were not affected .
In conclusion although there was no difference between the Na+/K+ ATPase activity in means of age , there was an environmental pollution and may be it was due to the industrial plant .
