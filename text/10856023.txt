To help address the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 , a physically based probabilistic model has been developed to quantify and analyze dermal and nondietary ingestion exposure and dose to pesticides .
The Residential Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation Model for Pesticides ( Residential-SHEDS ) simulates the exposures and doses of children contacting residues on surfaces in treated residences and on turf in treated residential yards .
The simulations combine sequential time-location-activity information from children's diaries with microlevel videotaped activity data , probability distributions of measured surface residues and exposure factors , and pharmacokinetic rate constants .
Model outputs include individual profiles and population statistics for daily dermal loading , mass in the blood compartment , ingested residue via nondietary objects , and mass of eliminated metabolite , as well as contributions from various routes , pathways , and media .
To illustrate the capabilities of the model framework , we applied Residential-SHEDS to estimate children's residential exposure and dose to chlorpyrifos for 12 exposure scenarios : 2 age groups ( 0-4 and 5-9 years ) ; 2 indoor pesticide application methods ( broadcast and crack and crevice ) ; and 3 postindoor application time periods ( < 1 , 1-7 , and 8-30 days ) .
Independent residential turf applications ( liquid or granular ) were included in each of these scenarios .
Despite the current data limitations and model assumptions , the case study predicts exposure and dose estimates that compare well to measurements in the published literature , and provides insights to the relative importance of exposure scenarios and pathways .
