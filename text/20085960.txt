There is compelling evidence in support of positive associations between zinc ( Zn ) deficiency and high accumulation of cadmium ( Cd ) in biological samples of different cancerous patients .
The incidence of mouth cancer has been increased among people who possess habit of drinking alcohol , tobacco smoking and chewing with gradients in Pakistan .
In the present study , Cd and Zn contents of blood and scalp hair samples of 92 male mouth cancer patients and 78 referents of same age group ( range 35-65 years ) , socio-economic status , localities and dietary habits .
Among referent male subjects , 56 consumed tobacco ( smoking/chewing ) , 22 had none of smoking and chewing tobacco habits , while none of them admitted for alcohol drinking .
The scalp hair and whole blood samples were oxidized by 65% nitric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide ( 2:1 ) ratio in microwave oven .
The Zn in digests was determined by flame atomic absorption while Cd was determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry .
The average Cd concentration was higher , while level of Zn was lower in the blood and scalp hair samples of mouth cancer patients as compared to referent subjects ( p < .001 ) .
The male referents consuming tobacco ( chewing and smoking ) have high level of Cd in both their biological samples as compared to those not smoking or chewing tobacco ( p < .012 ) .
The Cd/Zn ratio in both biological samples was found to be higher in patients than in referent subjects .
