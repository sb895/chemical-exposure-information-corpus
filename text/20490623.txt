Elevated concentrations of naturally occurring Cd have been found mainly in the bauxitic soils of central Jamaica at levels up to 100-1,000 times higher than typical worldwide averages .
Some food crops cultivated on these soils absorb significant amounts of Cd .
Autopsy studies of kidney Cd concentrations confirm elevated human exposure , and some long-term residents in central Jamaica exceed the general population average by a factor of two .
Diet studies have ascertained that a population in central Jamaica is at risk of being exposed to Cd levels in excess of the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake ( PTWI ) set by the WHO of 7 \u03bcgCd/kg bodyweight/week , and the EU TWI of 2.5\u03bcgCd/kg bodyweight/week .
Elevated levels of urine cadmium ( U-Cd ) and beta-2 microglobulin ( \u03b22-MG ) concentrations were confirmed with a strong correlation between soil Cd and the U-Cd .
Also , higher \u03b22-MG concentrations ( >200\u03bcg/g creatinine ) were found in the population with U-Cd concentrations greater than 2.5\u03bcg/L .
While this identification is often taken to indicate impairment in the reabsorption capacity of the renal tubules leading to renal disease , there is no evidence in the mortality records of enhanced deaths in central Jamaica compared with the general population resulting from renal disease or diabetes related complications .
The highest median age of death in the island is found in Manchester , the parish with the highest average Cd concentration .
While we have identified a possible Cd linked renal dysfunction , significant indications of morbidity are not present in the general population .
