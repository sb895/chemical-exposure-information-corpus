Concentrations of total mercury were determined by cold-vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy ( CV-AAS ) in 221 caps and 221 stalks of 15 species of wild growing higher fungi/mushrooms and 221 samples of corresponding soil substrate collected in 1997-98 in Manowo County , near the city of Koszalin in North-central Poland .
Mean mercury concentrations in caps and stalks of the mushroom species examined and soils varied between 30+/-31 and 920+/-280 , 17+/-11 and 560+/-220 , and 10+/-9 and 170+/-110 ng/g dry matter , respectively .
Cap to stalk mercury concentration quotients were from 1.0+/-0.4 in poison pax ( Paxillus involutus ) to 2.8+/-0.7 in slippery jack ( Suillus luteus ) .
Brown cort ( Cortinarius malicorius ) , fly agaric ( Amanita muscaria ) , orange-brown ringless amanita ( A. fulva ) , red-aspen bolete ( Leccinum rufum ) and mutagen milk cap ( Lactarius necator ) contained the highest concentrations of mercury both in caps and stalks , and mean concentrations varied between 600+/-750 and 920+/-280 and 370+/-470 and 560+/-220 ng/g dry matter , respectively .
An estimate of daily intake of mercury from mushroom consumption indicated that the flesh of edible species of mushrooms may not pose hazards to human health even at a maximum consumption rate of 28 g/day .
However , it should be noted that mercury intake from other foods will augment the daily intake rates .
Species such as the sickener ( Russula emetica ) , Geranium-scented russula ( R. fellea ) and poison pax ( P. involutus ) did not concentrate mercury as evidenced from the bioconcentration factors ( BCFs : concentrations in mushroom/concentration in soil substrate ) , which were less than 1 .
Similarly , red-hot milk cap ( L. rufus ) , rickstone funnel cap ( Clitocybe geotropa ) and European cow bolete ( S. bovinus ) were observed to be weak accumulators of mercury .
Fly agaric ( A. muscaria ) accumulated great concentrations of mercury with BCFs reaching 73+/-42 and 38+/-22 in caps and stalks , respectively .
Mercury BCFs of between 4.0+/-2.3 and 23+/-25 ( caps ) and 2.6+/-1.9 and 14+/-12 ( stalks ) were noted for the other mushroom species .
Relatively great concentrations of mercury in fly agaric ( A. muscaria ) were due to preferential uptake of this element by this species .
