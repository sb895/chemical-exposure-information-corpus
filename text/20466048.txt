Chronic cadmium exposure is associated with many adverse health effects in adults , but little is known about the scenario early in life .
This study assessed cadmium exposure and body burden in young children , born to women with known cadmium exposure via rice .
As part of our ongoing population-based , longitudinal study of health effects of early-life toxicants exposure in rural Bangladesh , we measured cadmium in urine of about 350 children at 1.5 and 5 years of age , and in 92 children at 3 months of age .
Median cadmium concentrations in urine were 0.30 , 0.16 and 0.30 microg/L at 3 months , 1.5 and 5 years of age , respectively ( 0.6 microg/L in mothers ) .
Cadmium concentrations in infant's urine correlated with concentrations in maternal breast milk , saliva , and urine .
As expected , concentrations in urine increased from 1.5 to 5 years of age .
Rice ( median 47 microgCd/kg ) is most likely the main source of exposure .
In conclusion , we found unexpectedly high cadmium exposure among children in rural Bangladesh .
Urinary cadmium concentrations were particularly elevated at 3 months of age , indicating limited reabsorption and accumulation of cadmium in the kidneys , known to be the main site of cadmium burden in older children and adults .
