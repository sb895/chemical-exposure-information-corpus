Using as an index of exposure the Cd concentration in rice and as an index of health effect the urinary abnormality rate ( proteinuria , glycosuria , and proteinuria with glycosuria ) in the most systematic and extensive health screening examination conducted in 1967 and 1968 in the Jinzu River basin , Japan ( a total of 13,183 subjects ) , we investigated whether a dose-response relationship exists between the two indices .
For subjects that lived in the same hamlet since birth , with low Cd concentrations in rice it was confirmed that renal dysfunction does not develop unless the length of residence is prolonged , whereas with high Cd concentrations in rice renal dysfunction develops even when the length of residence is short .
For subjects that lived in the same hamlet for over 30 years and that were aged over 50 years , the urinary abnormality rate in individual hamlets showed significant increases with increases in the mean Cd concentration in rice , demonstrating that a dose-response relationship existed .
The allowable values of Cd concentration in rice were estimated to be in the range of 0.05-0.20 ppm , representing values lower than the 0.4 ppm provisionally adopted by the Japanese government .
