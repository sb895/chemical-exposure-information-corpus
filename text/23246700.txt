Phthalates as well as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate ( DEHA ) are used as plasticizers in diverse applications and are of toxicological concern .
The study was conducted with a study population of 25 German subjects aged between 15 and 21 months .
Overall , 16 phthalates and DEHA were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in a total of 171 duplicate diet samples collected over 7 consecutive days , and 20 phthalate metabolites were analyzed in the urine samples collected over 7 consecutive days using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method .
The median " high " daily dietary intake based on 95th percentiles was 4.66 \u03bcg/kg b.w. for di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) , 1.03 \u03bcg/kg b.w. for di-isobutyl phthalate ( DiBP ) , and 0.70 \u03bcg/kg b.w. for di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) , and 1.0 \u03bcg/kg b.w. for DEHA .
The " high " daily total intake from biomonitoring data was 4.9 \u03bcg/kg b.w. for DEHP , 2.2 \u03bcg/kg b.w. for DnBP , 3.9 \u03bcg/kg b.w. for DiBP , and 2.6 \u03bcg/kg b.w. for di-isononyl phthalate .
The comparison of the two intake estimates indicates that the dominant intake source of DEHP was food ingestion , whereas other sources considerably contributed to the total intake of other phthalates .
Using our " high " intake scenario , none of the analyzed phthalates reached the recommended tolerable daily intake levels .
