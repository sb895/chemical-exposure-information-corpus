Concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and non- and mono-ortho-substituted polychlorinated biphenyls ( dioxin-like PCBs ) were measured in tissues of humans , fishes , chicken , lamb , goat , predatory birds , and Ganges River dolphins collected from various locations in India .
PCDDs/DFs were found in most of the samples analyzed with the liver of spotted owlet containing the highest concentration of 3,300 pg/g , fat wt. 2,3,7,8-Substituted PCDDs and PCDFs were found in human fattissues at concentrations ranging from 170 to 1,300 pg/g , fat wt .
Concentrations of PCDDs were generally greaterthan those of PCDFs in human tissues , fishes , animal fat , and dolphin .
Among fishes , meat , and wildlife samples analyzed , concentrations of PCDDs/DFs were found in the following order : country chicken < goat/lamb fat < fishes < river dolphins < predatory birds .
Hepta-CDDs and OCDD were the major PCDD homologues found in humans , fishes , meat products , and dolphins. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents of PCDDs/DFs were greater than those of PCBs in selected fish , dolphin , and human samples .
To our knowledge , this is the first report of PCDDs and PCDFs in human tissues , fishes , meat , and wildlife collected from India .
