A large number of epidemiologic studies have been undertaken to identify potential risk factors for cancer , amongst which the association with cadmium has received considerable attention .
There is compelling evidence in support of positive associations between cadmium and risk of lung cancer .
In present study we measured the concentration of Cd in whole blood and scalp hair samples of 120 male lung cancer patients ( smokers ) and 150 controls or referents ( smokers and nonsmokers ) from different cities of Pakistan .
Both referents and patients were of same age group ( ranged 40-70 years ) , socio-economic status , localities and dietary habits .
The scalp hair and whole blood samples were oxidized by 65% nitric acid : 30% hydrogen peroxide ( 2:1 ) ratio in microwave oven .
To check the validity of the proposed method , a conventional wet acid digestion method was used to obtain total Cd concentration in certified samples of human hair BCR 397 and Clincheck control-lyophilized human whole blood .
All digests were analyzed for Cd concentration by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometer ( ETAAS ) .
The results of this study showed that the average Cd concentration was higher in the blood and scalp hair of lung cancer patients at different stages as compared to controls ( p<001 ) .
The smoker referents have high level of Cd in both biological samples as compared to nonsmoker subjects .
These results illustrate that the patients who continued smoking after confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer have 34.2-67.26 and 22.4-57.3% more Cd in blood samples and scalp hair than lung cancer patients who cease smoking .
This study is compelling evidence in support of positive associations between cadmium , cigarette smoking and lung cancer risk .
