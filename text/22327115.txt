In 2009 and 2010 , 720 serum samples were collected from non-occupationally exposed study participants at four Korean locations and monitored for the presence of 27 polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE ) congeners .
The median concentrations of \u03a3(27)PBDEs ( the sum of 27 congeners ) and \u03a3(3-7)PBDEs ( the sum of tri- to hepta-BDE congeners ) were 6.04 and 4.97 ng/g lipid , respectively .
The most abundant congener detected in serum samples was BDE-153 , followed by BDE-47 and BDE-99 .
The median value of \u03a3(3-7)PBDEs was similar to the median values observed in Asia and Europe , but much lower than that observed in North America .
Some significant differences , based on geographic region and sex , were observed .
We also observed a positive increase of BDE-153 with regard to age .
In addition , we estimated the daily exposure to PBDEs from previously published reports of PBDE concentrations in food and dust , and determined the individual contributions of a variety of sources .
