Ready-to-eat packed meals intended to hospital patients were studied over a two-weeks period to measure the contents of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) and di-n-butylphthalate ( DBP ) and to evaluate their daily intake by total diet .
The packaging consisted of polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) dishes sealed with polypropylene ( PP ) foil .
The DEHP mean concentrations in total meals varied from 0.061±0.028 to 0.307±0.138μg/gwetweight ( wet wt. ) ; the DBP mean levels varied from 0.025±0.018 to 0.174±0.091μg/gwetwt .
Highest levels of concentration for DEHP and DBP were found in bread with mean values of 0.307±0.138μg/gwetwt. and 0.174±0.091μg/gwetwt. for DEHP and DBP , respectively .
The daily intake for DEHP was 3.1±0.9μg/kgbw and 1.5±0.5μg/kgbw for DBP .
The mean±sd incidence of DEHP and DBP intake via hospital meals on the respective EFSA TDI was 6±2% ( range 4-11% ) , and 15±5% ( range 8-24% ) , respectively .
Even if for hospital patients the major route of exposure may be represented by medical devices , the influence of the diet could have a significant value on TDI .
