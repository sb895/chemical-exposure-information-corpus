The suitability of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene as a biomarker for the assessment of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) in petrochemical industries was evaluated in 562 workers involved in various operations in petrochemical industries .
The median 1-hydroxypyrene concentration in 121 of these workers ( both smokers and non-smokers ) who had had no recent occupational exposure to PAH was 0.11 mumol/mol creatinine .
The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was 0.51 mumol/mol creatinine .
During activities with a low potential exposure to PAH , such as loading bitumen and the handling of clarified slurry oils and furfural extracts , 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations were only marginally increased compared with the values measured in the 121 workers with no recent occupational exposure to PAH .
Despite the substantially higher potential exposure to PAH during clean-out operations of various oil refinery installations , the concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene in the workers involved were in the same range .
This suggests that personal protection equipment was generally adequate to prevent excessive exposure .
However , in workers digging PAH-contaminated soil and workers engaged in the production of needle coke from ethylene cracker residue , significantly increased urinary 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations were measured .
A major decrease in urinary 1-hydroxypyrene following the application of dermal protective equipment in the ground workers suggested that skin absorption plays a major role in occupational exposure to PAH .
The excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene by the workers of the needle coke plant was investigated in relation to potential determinants of exposure to PAH .
It was indeed found that not only inhalatory but also dermal exposure was a significant determinant of occupational exposure to PAH .
