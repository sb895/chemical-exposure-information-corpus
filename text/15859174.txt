The article describes the exposure pathways of cadmium in the Czech urban population .
The data on Cd concentrations originated from the Environmental Health Monitoring System , which has been realized in 30 cities since 1994 .
The data on cadmium content in particular exposure pathways - diet , drinking water , ambient air and soil -were processed for the period 1994-2003 .
The estimate of the daily dietary intake for an average adult population amounted to 11-19 microg/d , i.e. 0.17-0.30 microg/kg bw/d , which represents 17%-30% of the PTWI ( provisional tolerable weekly intake ) .
The contribution from drinking water to the oral exposure is low ; on average 0.5 microg/d .
Potential exposure to airborne Cd was estimated at about 0.02 microg/d .
The additional Cd intake from urban soil ingestion probable in small children was found to be insignificant based on Cd concentrations in the soil of kindergarten playgrounds .
Biomonitoring outputs characterize the recent and life-long cadmium burden of the Czech population from general environment In 1994-2003 , the median blood Cd levels ranged in the interval 0.9-0.4 microg/l blood , in smokers being more than double that in non-smokers .
Blood Cd levels detected indicate slightly decreasing trend as well as urine Cd levels ( range of median values 0.44-0.28 microg/g creatinine ) .
Since 1996 the levels in children have been found in more than 50% cases below the detection limit of the methods used .
The estimated total cadmium intake in the Czech urban population does not signalize any increased risk of health impairment considering non-carcinogenic effects .
