Parabens are alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid and are used as antimicrobial preservatives in a range of consumer products , including cosmetics , pharmaceuticals , and foodstuffs .
Despite their widespread use , prior to this study , paraben concentrations in foodstuffs from China and human dietary exposure to these chemicals have been unknown .
In this study , concentrations of six parabens were determined in 13 categories of food samples ( n=282 ) , including cereals and cereal products , meat , fish and seafood , eggs , dairy products , bean products , fruits , vegetables , cookies , beverages , cooking oils , condiments , and others , collected from nine cities in China .
Almost all ( detection rate : 99% ) food samples contained at least one of the parabens analyzed , and the total concentrations ( \u03a3Parabens ; sum of six parabens ) ranged from below limit of quantification ( LOQ ) to 2530ng/g fresh weight , with an overall mean value of 39.3ng/g .
Methyl paraben ( MeP ) , ethyl paraben ( EtP ) , and propyl paraben ( PrP ) were the major paraben analogs found in foodstuffs , and these compounds accounted for 59% , 24% , and 10% , respectively , of \u03a3Paraben concentrations .
Although the mean concentrations of \u03a3Parabens varied among different categories of food items ( from 0.839ng/g in beverages to 100ng/g in vegetables ) , the concentrations were not statistically significant among the 13 food categories , including canned foodstuffs .
Estimated daily intake ( EDI ) of parabens was based on the measured concentrations in foods and the corresponding daily food ingestion rates .
The mean and 95th percentile values for EDI were 1010 and 3040ng/kg body weight ( bw)/day for adult men and 1060 and 3170ng/kg bw/day for adult women , respectively .
