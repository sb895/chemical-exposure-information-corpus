BACKGROUND Cadmium exposure has been associated with increased all-cause , cancer , and cardiovascular disease mortality .
However , studies investigating this association have included participants with considerably higher levels of cadmium than those found in the general population .
OBJECTIVE We aimed to evaluate the association of creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium levels with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the U.S. general population .
METHODS We analyzed the relationship between cadmium measured in 13,958 adults who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1988-1994 and were followed through 31 December 2000 , and all-cause , cancer , cardiovascular disease , and coronary heart disease mortality .
RESULTS The geometric mean levels of urinary cadmium per gram of urinary creatinine in study participants were 0.28 and 0.40 microg/g for men and women , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .
After multivariable adjustment , including smoking , a major source of cadmium exposure in nonoccupationally exposed populations , the hazard ratios [ 95% confidence interval ( CI) ] for all-cause , cancer , cardiovascular disease , and coronary heart disease mortality associated with a 2-fold higher creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium were , respectively , 1.28 ( 95% CI , 1.15-1.43 ) , 1.55 ( 95% CI , 1.21-1.98 ) , 1.21 ( 95% CI , 1.07-1.36 ) , and 1.36 ( 95% CI , 1.11-1.66 ) for men and 1.06 ( 95% CI , 0.96-1.16 ) , 1.07 ( 95% CI , 0.85-1.35 ) , 0.93 ( 95% CI , 0.84-1.04 ) , and 0.82 ( 95% CI , 0.76-0.89 ) for women .
CONCLUSIONS Environmental cadmium exposure was associated with an increased risk of all-cause , cancer , and cardiovascular disease mortality among men , but not among women .
Additional efforts are warranted to fully explain gender differences on the impact of environmental cadmium exposure .
