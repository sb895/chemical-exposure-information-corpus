The sinking of the ' Prestige ' oil tanker in front of the Galician coast ( NW of Spain ) in November 2002 offered a unique opportunity to analyze intermediate cytogenetic and endocrine effects among people exposed to the complex mixture of substances that oil constitutes , including several toxic heavy metals .
In this work we evaluated the relationship between exposure to heavy metals ( blood concentrations of aluminium , cadmium , nickel , lead and zinc ) and genotoxic parameters ( sister chromatid exchanges , micronucleus test and comet assay ) or endocrine parameters ( plasmatic concentrations of prolactin and cortisol ) in subjects exposed to ' Prestige ' oil during cleaning tasks developed after the spillage .
Concentrations of lead were significantly related to the comet assay even after adjusting by age , sex and smoking .
Cortisol concentrations were significantly influenced by aluminium , nickel ( both , inversely ) and cadmium ( positively ) .
Women had clearly higher concentrations of prolactin and cortisol , even when adjusting by age , smoking , cadmium , aluminium or nickel .
Plasmatic cortisol was jointly influenced by gender , smoking and aluminium or nickel ( all p<0.05 ) .
In women there was a strong relationship between concentrations of cadmium and prolactin ( beta=0.37 , p=0.031 ) .
When the effects of cadmium , aluminium and nickel on cortisol were simultaneously assessed , only the latter two metals remained statistically significant .
Among parameters analysed , cortisol appeared to be the most sensitive to the effects of metal exposure .
Plasma levels of cortisol deserve further evaluation as a potentially relevant biomarker to assess the effects of exposure to heavy metals .
