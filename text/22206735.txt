The association between environmental cadmium exposure and frontal T wave axis deviation , a valuable and easily detected subclinical marker of ventricular arrhythmias in individuals without heart disease is unexplored and unknown .
The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that cadmium exposure predicts frontal T-wave axis deviation .
US adults 40 years of age or older from NHANES III were included in the analysis .
The participants ' creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium concentrations expressed as micrograms per gram were determined .
Frontal T-wave axis deviations were measured from the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram .
Multivariable regression analyses adjusting for age , race , smoking , metabolic syndrome , left ventricular mass , QRS duration and heart rate were performed .
The odds ratio of borderline and abnormal frontal T wave axis deviations due to cadmium exposure and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) were 1.25 ( 1.10-1.54 ) and 1.64 ( 1.27-2.12 ) , respectively .
This study documents a positive graded relationship between environmental cadmium exposure and the risk for frontal T-wave axis deviation .
Screening individuals with large body burden of cadmium to identify frontal T-wave axis deviation is warranted .
