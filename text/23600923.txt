Chronic exposure to arsenic ( As ) threatens human health .
To systematically understand the health risks induced by As ingestion , we explored water and diet contributions to As exposure , and compared As in biomarkers and the arsenicosis in a geogenic As area in China .
In this study , high percentages of water ( 77% of n = 131 total samples ) , vegetables ( 92% , n = 120 ) , cereals ( 32% , n = 25 ) , urine ( 70% , n = 99 ) , nails ( 76% , n = 176 ) , and hair ( 62% , n = 61 ) contained As higher than the acceptable levels .
Dietary As contributed 92% of the average daily dose ( ADD ) when the water As concentration was less than 10 \u03bcg/L , for which 5 out of 30 examined participants were diagnosed with arsenicosis symptoms .
The distinct positive correlation between ADD and As concentrations in urine , nails , and hair suggests different applicability for these biomarkers .
Methylated As as the predominant urinary As species confirms that the ingested inorganic As is methylated and is excreted through urine .
In situ microdistribution and speciation analysis indicates that As is mainly associated with sulfur in nails and hair .
Nails , rather than hair and urine , could be used as a proper biomarker for arsenicosis .
High ADD from the environment and low excretion could result in As toxicity to humans .
