Epidemiologic studies commonly use mercury ( Hg ) level in hair as a valid proxy to estimate human exposure to methylmercury ( MeHg ) through fish consumption .
This study presents the results yielded by a complete data set on fish consumption habits , Hg levels in edible fish resources , and corresponding Hg accumulation in hair , gathered in three distinct communities of eastern Canada .
For one of these communities , the average hair Hg concentration was 14 times less than the expected value based on calculated daily oral exposure and current knowledge of MeHg metabolism .
This finding could be explained by differences in specific genetic characteristics and/or interactive effects of other dietary components .
