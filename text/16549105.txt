A group of islands with a total population of about 200,000 was identified in the Eastern Aegean , where there was evidence to suggest possible increased exposure to methylmercury ( MeHg ) through consumption of fresh local fish and other seafood from seas bordered by mercury-bearing rock .
A feasibility study was conducted to explore the possibility of defining a local population of mother-child pairs in whom to investigate the intrauterine exposure effect .
Analysis of 246 hair samples collected from pregnant women and mothers of newborn babies and children under 5 years showed levels of total Hg from 0.046 microg/g to 17.5 microg/g , geometric mean 1.36 microg/g , and of MeHg from 0.031 microg/g to 16.2 microg/g , geometric mean 1.07 microg/g .
About 5% of the mothers had hair total Hg levels in excess of 6.00 microg/g .
Investigation of dietary habits showed that one-third of the mothers eat fresh local fish at least 3 times weekly , one-third once a week and 10% rarely or never .
There was a close association between weekly rates of local fish consumption and hair levels of both total Hg and MeHg .
A power calculation determined that a cohort of 3000 mother-child pairs would enable comparison of a high-exposure group ( those with the upper 5% of hair MeHg ) with a low exposure group ( 5% , selected from those with the lower 30% of hair MeHg , matched for confounding factors ) , in order to detect an effect size of 0.35 to 0.45 at a power of 85-95% .
It is concluded that the mothers and children in the Eastern Aegean islands studied comprise a population suitable for an epidemiological study of the effects of intrauterine exposure to MeHg via maternal fresh local fish consumption .
