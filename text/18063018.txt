This study presents for the first time temporal changes of organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in Russian human breast milk samples .
Concentrations of OCPs and PCBs in samples from three locations in the North West of Russia in 2000-2002 ( n=42 ) , were compared to corresponding levels measured in 1993-1996 ( n=58 ) .
In addition brominated flame retardants ( BFRs ) , consisting of polybrominated diphenylethers ( PBDEs ) ( including BDE-209 ) and hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) were analysed in samples from 2000-2002 ( n=37 ) .
The present levels of SigmaDDTs and SigmaHCHs were 5 and 10 times higher than corresponding levels in the neighbouring country Norway .
Median concentrations of SigmaHCHs ( 196 microg/kg lw ) , SigmaCHBs ( 19.7 microg/kg lw ) and SigmaPCBs(16) ( 316 microg/kg lw ) were highest in Murmansk .
The percentage of p,p'-DDT to SigmaDDTs and ratio DDE/DDT suggest possible ongoing use of DDT in Russia .
Levels of PBDE were low and dominated by the congeners BDE-47 and BDE-153 .
The deca brominated BDE-209 was detected in all analysed samples ( median concentration 0.19 microg/kg lipid ) .
Levels of SigmaOCPs and SigmaPCBs decreased 56 and 30% in Murmansk and 36 and 43% in Arkhangelsk during the study period .
The decline of SigmaOCPs was significant at both locations ( p<0.05-p<0.0001 ) .
For SigmaPCBs , the decreasing trend was only significant in Arkhangelsk ( p<0.0001 ) .
In addition , a decline of Sigmatotal TEQs ( SigmaTEQs of PCDDs/PCDFs , non-ortho- and mono-ortho PCBs ) was observed in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk during the study period .
The exposure of infants by PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs is still exceeding the daily tolerable intake ( TDI ) in North West Russia .
However , the concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs seem to decline very rapidly .
