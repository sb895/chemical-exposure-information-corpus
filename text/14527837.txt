Pig-house dust originates from feed , bedding , feces , and the animals themselves .
If the animals receive drugs such as antibiotics , residues of these substances may occur in manure , in the air , or on surfaces of the respective animal house .
In a retrospective study , we investigated dust samples collected during two decades from the same piggery for the occurrence of various antibiotics .
In 90% of these samples , we detected up to five different antibiotics , including tylosin , various tetracyclines , sulfamethazine , and chloramphenicol , in total amounts up to 12.5 mg/kg dust .
High dust exposure in animal confinement buildings is believed to be a respiratory health hazard because of the high content of microorganisms , endotoxins , and allergens .
Further risks may arise from the inhalation of dust contaminated with a cocktail of antibiotics .
Apart from that , our data provide first evidence for a new route of entry for veterinary drugs in the environment .
