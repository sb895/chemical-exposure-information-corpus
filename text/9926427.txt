Concentrations of cadmium were determined in the renal cortex and hair of 67 persons who died between 1996 and 1997 in the Gda\u0144sk region of Poland .
The mean concentrations in the renal cortex and the hair were : 39.8 +/- 21.45 micrograms/g and 0.35 +/- 0.33 microgram/g , respectively .
The mean age of the population studied was 47.6 +/- 15.8 years .
The concentration of cadmium in the renal cortex was age-dependent .
In the age groups : 18-30 , 31-40 , 41-50 , 51-60 and 61-90 it amounted to : 19.1 +/- 11.0 micrograms/g , 43.3 +/- 21.6 micrograms/g , 47.9 +/- 20.8 micrograms/g , 41.5 +/- 20.4 micrograms/g and 33.6 +/- 18.0 micrograms/g , respectively .
No correlation between the cadmium contents in the renal cortex and hair has been established .
Hair is not a good indicator of exposure to cadmium .
