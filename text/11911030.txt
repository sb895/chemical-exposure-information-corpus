The purpose of the investigation was to study the effects on the respiratory system in mine workers with long-term exposure to manganese ( Mn ) in the workplace .
The study included a follow-up of pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms among 145 workers employed in a large Mn mine and 65 matched controls , and the assessment of Mn concentrations in environment and biological samples .
Lung function was measured by recording spirometric parameters .
The Mn-exposed workers reported more respiratory symptoms and a significantly higher prevalence of all grades of pulmonary function impairment .
All predicted symptoms except for asthma increased significantly in the current smoking group compared with the non-smoking group .
There was a significant decrease in FEV1 , FVC , and FEV1% values in exposed workers compared with controls at stages 2 and 3 , with an additive effect of the smoking habit .
The Mn concentrations in blood , urine , and hair were significantly higher in the exposed workers than in the controls .
The level of cumulative exposure index of workplace Mn was notable and did not change significantly over this study .
The respiratory effects found in Mn-exposed workers were probably caused by the Mn in the workplace and the synergistic effect of smoking .
These effects indicate a need for respiratory protection and improvements in the work environment .
