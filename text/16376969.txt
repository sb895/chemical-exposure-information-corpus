A study of the dietary intake of dioxins , consisting of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( dioxin-like PCBs ) through foods retailed in the metropolitan Tokyo area from 1999 to 2004 was carried out by the total diet-market basket method on the basis of food classification ( 14 groups ) and the data on food consumption in the Tokyo region obtained from the Japan Nutrition Survey .
The daily intake of dioxins per kg of body weight for a 50 kg average adult body was 2.18 pg TEQ/kg/day in 1999 , 1.87 pg TEQ/kg/day in 2000 , 1.25 pg TEQ/kg/day in 2001 , 1.60 pg TEQ/kg/day in 2002 and 2003 and 1.55 pg TEQ/kg/day in 2004 , respectively .
These amounts were less than the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) of 4 pg TEQ/kg/day for dioxins established in Japan .
The dioxins taken daily through fish and shellfish ( group 10 ) accounted for more than 50% of sum WHO-TEQs .
In addition , more than 90% of the daily intake of dioxins was taken through fish and shellfish ( group 10 ) , meat and eggs ( group 11 ) , milk and dairy products ( group 12 ) .
Also , this study clearly showed that the ratio of dioxin-like PCBs in the daily intake of dioxins was increasing yearly because the reduction rate of dioxin-like PCBs was lower than that of PCDDs and PCDFs in foods .
