Cross-sectional analysis was conducted to access the relationships between developing carotid artery atherosclerosis through consuming high fluoride in drinking water and its possible mechanism , using the baseline data collected from 585 study subjects .
In the cross sectional analysis , subjects were divided into four groups based on the concentrations of fluoride in their drinking water .
The range of fluoride concentrations was : normal group ( less than 1.20 mg/L ) , mild group ( 1.21-2.00 mg/L ) , moderate group ( 2.01-3.00 mg/L ) , and high concentration group ( more than 3.01 mg/L ) .
The prevalence rate of carotid artery atherosclerosis in the subjects in each group was found to be 16.13% , 27.22% , 27.10% , and 29.69% , respectively .
Significant difference between the prevalence of carotid artery atherosclerosis in the mild , moderate and high fluoride exposure group and in the normal group was observed ( P<0.05 ) .
In addition , it was found that elevated intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) and reduced glutathione peroxidases ( GPx ) was associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in fluoride endemic areas .
The findings of the research study revealed a significant positive relationship between excess fluoride exposure from drinking water and prevalence of carotid artery atherosclerosis in adults living in fluoride endemic areas .
The possible mechanism was the excess fluoride induced the decreasing level of GPx causing the systemic inflammation and endothelial activation by oxidative stress .
