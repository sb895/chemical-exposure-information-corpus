Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) were determined in two fish species , mullet ( Mugil cephalus ) and sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) , collected from Bizerte Lagoon and the Mediterranean Sea .
In all samples , PCBs were found in higher concentrations than OCPs .
The highest concentrations of OCPs and PCBs were found in sea bass , and in Bizerte Lagoon .
Concentrations of DDTs and PCBs detected in this study were generally comparable or slightly higher than those found in studies from other Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean regions subject to a high anthropogenic impact. \u2211PCBs , \u2211HCHs and HCB levels were negatively correlated with lipid content , while no such correlation was seen for \u2211DDTs .
A significant correlation between levels and length and between levels and weight existed only for \u2211PCBs .
The daily intake of PCBs and OCPs ingested by people living in Bizerte through the studied fish species was estimated and compared with those observed in other areas .
