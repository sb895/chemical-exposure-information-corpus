Homocysteine levels are associated with peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) in observational studies .
Lead and cadmium are risk factors for PAD that affect thiol metabolism , and they may partly explain the association of homocysteine with PAD .
To evaluate the roles of lead and cadmium exposure in confounding the association between homocysteine and PAD , the authors performed a cross-sectional study among 4,447 persons aged > or = 40 years who participated in the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) .
PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial blood pressure index less than 0.90 in at least one leg .
After adjustment for sociodemographic variables , the odds ratio for PAD in the highest quintile of homocysteine compared with the lowest was 1.92 ( p(trend) = 0.004 ) .
Adjusting for blood lead and cadmium levels reduced this odds ratio to 1.37 ( p(trend) = 0.13 ) , and further adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration rate and smoking reduced it to 0.89 ( p(trend) = 0.87 ) .
Adjustment for other risk factors did not affect this association .
In the general population , the association of homocysteine level with PAD can be completely explained by confounding due to smoking , increased blood lead and cadmium levels , and impaired renal function .
The association of lead and cadmium with PAD risk deserves further investigation .
