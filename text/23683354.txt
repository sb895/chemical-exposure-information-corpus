Volatile aromatic hydrocarbons ( VAHs : benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , mp-xylene , o-xylene , styrene , naphthalene ) in residential indoor air in Brisbane , Australia were measured in 32 houses .
The total VAHs ( TVAHs ) levels ranged between 2 and 137\u03bcg/m(3) and were lower than the most of the houses in the literature data .
The VAHs were believed to originate from heat insulation systems , building material products as well motor vehicles but naphthalene and styrene originated from other sources .
Internal garages had concentrations which are higher than the indoor air by 25-50% due to the presence of motor vehicles and may be a major source of indoor VAHs .
However indoor concentrations are higher than that in the outdoor ambient air .
The age of the house was found to be negatively related to VAHs concentrations in the houses with the half-life of TVAH at approximately 13years .
The concentration levels of benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene and styrene are well below the guideline values set by agencies from Hong Kong , Japan , Germany and the WHO while the concentration level of naphthalene in one house exceeded the guideline value from Germany .
