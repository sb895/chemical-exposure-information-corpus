Arsenic ( As ) is a common element in the environment with many industrial uses , but it also can be a contaminant in drinking water and present serious health concerns .
Earlier studies on the quality of drinking water in the city of Hermosillo , Sonora , MÃ©xico , showed high levels of As ( > 0.05 ppm ) in water from wells located in the northern part of the city .
Additionally a high positive correlation between the levels of Fluoride ( F ) and As in the same wells was found .
Therefore , the objective of this study was to determine the excretion of As in children , 7-11 years of age , that had been exposed to elevated levels of As in their drinking water .
Twenty-four-hour urine samples and a water sample taken directly in the home were collected from school age children living in two different areas with known high levels of As in their drinking water .
A control group with normal levels of As in their water was also included .
As was determined by an atomic absorption-hydride generator , verified with the use of NBS certified standards ( SRM 1643a and SRM 2670 ) .
None of the water samples exceeded the limit established for drinking water ; however , there was a significant difference between the intake of As and the As in drinking water among the three areas of the study .
Average As in water was 0.009 +/- 0.002 and 0.030 +/- 0.011 micrograms/ml between the control and high areas .
Intake ( in micrograms/day ) was 15 +/- 3 and 54 +/- 18 .
In the group consuming water with high levels of As , 65% of the children exceeded the recommended dose of < 1 micrograms/kg/day ( EPA , 1988 ) .
Several children in this study also had high levels of As in their urine .
Even though As levels in the drinking water are within the norms , it appears that children exposed to high levels of As in their drinking water may have a health risk .
