X-ray and fluorescence analysis covered elemental composition of hair in 39 patients with myocardial infarction and 23 healthy individuals .
The highest " chemical pollution " was seen in myocardial infarction patients whose occupations are associated with xenobiotics exposure .
Hair of those patients contain reliably high amounts of iron , copper , manganese , chromium , cadmium , lead , strontium , rubidium , potassium , bromium and clorine .
Nearly two thirds of those patients had potassium and strontium levels considerably exceeding maximally allowable values .
Reliably higher levels of some chemical elements in myocardial infarction patients vs. controls could be a proof of direct cause-effect relationships between xenobiotics influence and coronary affection in individuals aged under 50 , especially subjected to regular risk factors .
