Measurements of intake and uptake of cadmium in relation to diet composition were carried out in 57 nonsmoking women , 20-50 years of age .
A vegetarian/high-fiber diet and a mixed-diet group were constructed based on results from a food frequency questionnaire .
Duplicate diets and the corresponding feces were collected during 4 consecutive days in parallel with dietary recording of type and amount of food ingested for determination of the dietary intake of cadmium and various nutrients .
Blood and 24-hr urine samples were collected for determination of cadmium , hemoglobin , ferritin , and zinc .
There were no differences in the intake of nutrients between the mixed-diet and the high-fiber diet groups , except for a significantly higher intake of fiber ( p < 0.001 ) and cadmium ( p < 0.002 ) in the high-fiber group .
Fecal cadmium corresponded to 98% in the mixed-diet group and 100% in the high-fiber diet group .
No differences in blood cadmium ( BCd ) or urinary cadmium ( UCd ) between groups could be detected .
There was a tendency toward higher BCd and UCd concentrations with increasing fiber intake ; however , the concentrations were not statistically significant at the 5% level , indicating an inhibitory effect of fiber on the gastrointestinal absorption of cadmium .
Sixty-seven percent of the women had serum ferritin < 30 micrograms/l , indicating reduced body iron stores , which were highly associated with higher BCd ( irrespective of fiber intake ) .
BCd was mainly correlated with UCd , serum ferritin , age , anf fibre intake .
UCd and serum ferritin explained almost 60% of the variation in BCd.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
