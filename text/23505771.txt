Exposure to lead has been shown to be harmful to adults ; it is a teratogen , it can damage the peripheral nervous system , and it adversely affects the reproductive system .
Professional lead-based paint remediation workers are at risk of exposure to lead dust .
The authors ' study was conducted to determine if these remediation workers transfer lead from their work site to their vehicles and then potentially expose their families .
It was hypothesized that remediation workers transported the lead from the remediation work site to the floorboards of their vehicles due to not following required protective equipment use .
The laboratory's level of quantitation for lead on the wipe samples , 10 microg/ft2 , was used to indicate lead contamination .
This level was exceeded in 50% of the floorboards sampled .
These results confirm that many vehicle floorboards used by remediation workers are contaminated with lead dust , potentially resulting in transfer of lead dust .
The ultimate detrimental outcome could be the transfer of lead particles to other family members , causing the poisoning of a child or other at-risk person .
