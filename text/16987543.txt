We measured the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls ( non-ortho PCBs ) and mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls ( mono-ortho PCBs ) in blood collected from 279 Yusho patients living in Japan , 92 Yusho-suspected persons living in Japan and 127 normal controls living in Fukuoka Prefecture , and compared among the groups in terms the concentrations of these compounds .
The total toxic equivalents ( TEQ ) concentrations of PCDDs , PCDFs , non-ortho PCBs , and mono-ortho PCBs in the bloods of Yusho patients and Yusho-suspected persons were 161.4 and 51.2 pg TEQ/g lipid , respectively and were about 3.5 and 1.1 times higher than those of normal controls , respectively .
Although the TEQ concentrations of PCDDs , non-ortho PCBs , and mono-ortho PCBs among Yusho patients , Yusho-suspected persons and normal controls were nearly the same , the PCDFs levels of Yusho patients were significantly higher than those of Yusho-suspected persons and about 10.3 times higher than those of normal controls .
In Yusho patients , PCDFs contributed about 65% to the total TEQ concentration .
Among the PCDFs congeners for Yusho patients , the concentration of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran ( PeCDF ) was about 11.3 times higher than that of normal controls .
These findings indicated that Yusho patients even now , more than 34 years after the outbreak of Yusho , have much higher blood levels of 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF in general than do unaffected persons .
