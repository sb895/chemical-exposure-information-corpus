Experimental studies have suggested the potential link between exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and auditory impairment , but little evidence exists to support the ototoxicity of PCBs in human .
Only a few studies have implicated PCB-induced hearing loss in children .
This study investigated the association between serum PCB levels and hearing impairment in US adults .
We analyzed data from 1946 adults aged 20years and older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 : eleven PCB congeners detected in 60-90% of the samples at greater than the limit of detection ( LOD ) were selected , and hearing impairment was defined as a pure-tone average of the thresholds at 0.5 , 1 , 2 and 4kHz of >25dB hearing level in better ear .
The adjusted odds ratio of hearing impairment was significantly increased comparing the highest quartile ( Q4 ) of detectable PCB range with the reference ( below LOD ) : 5.83 ( 95% CI : 1.20-28.24 ) for 2,2',3,3',4,4',5-heptachlorobiphenyl ( PCB-170 ) , 7.79(95% CI : 1.81-33.44 ) for 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptachlorobiphenyl ( PCB-180 ) , 7.46 ( 95% CI : 1.62-34.47 ) for 2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachlorobiphenyl ( PCB-187 ) , 8.59 ( 95% CI : 1.26-58.73 ) for 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5'-octachlorobiphenyl ( PCB-194 ) , 11.62 ( 95% CI : 2.20-61.55 ) for 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,6'-octachlorobiphenyl ( PCB-196 ) .
Our findings suggest that specific classes of PCB levels may be associated with hearing impairment in a general sample of adults .
