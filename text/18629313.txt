BACKGROUND Biomass fuel is the primary source of domestic fuel in much of rural China .
Previous studies have not characterized particle exposure through time-activity diaries or personal monitoring in mainland China .
OBJECTIVES In this study we characterized indoor and personal particle exposure in six households in northeastern China ( three urban , three rural ) and explored differences by location , cooking status , activity , and fuel type .
Rural homes used biomass .
Urban homes used a combination of electricity and natural gas .
METHODS Stationary monitors measured hourly indoor particulate matter ( PM ) with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm ( PM10 ) for rural and urban kitchens , urban sitting rooms , and outdoors .
Personal monitors for PM with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 2.5 microm ( PM2.5 ) were employed for 10 participants .
Time-activity patterns in 30-min intervals were recorded by researchers for each participant .
RESULTS Stationary monitoring results indicate that rural kitchen PM10 levels are three times higher than those in urban kitchens during cooking .
PM10 was 6.1 times higher during cooking periods than during noncooking periods for rural kitchens .
Personal PM2.5 levels for rural cooks were 2.8-3.6 times higher than for all other participant categories .
The highest PM2.5 exposures occurred during cooking periods for urban and rural cooks .
However , rural cooks had 5.4 times higher PM2.5 levels during cooking than did urban cooks .
Rural cooks spent 2.5 times more hours per day cooking than did their urban counterparts .
CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that biomass burning for cooking contributes substantially to indoor particulate levels and that this exposure is particularly elevated for cooks .
Second-by-second personal PM2.5 exposures revealed differences in exposures by population group and strong temporal heterogeneity that would be obscured by aggregate metrics .
