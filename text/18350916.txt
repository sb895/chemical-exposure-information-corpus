The toxicity of methylmercury ( Me-Hg ) has caused widespread public human concern as a result of several widely publicized disasters .
Me-Hg is highly toxic , and the nervous system is its principal target tissue for humans .
Although the general population is primarily exposed to Me-Hg through contaminated fish and marine mammals , in Hg mining areas a long history of mining activities can produce serious Hg pollution to the local environment In a study of 98 persons from the Wanshan Hg mining area , hair Me-Hg levels indicated Me-Hg exposure .
Rice , the staple food of the local inhabitants also showed high total Hg ( T-Hg ) and Me-Hg levels .
The geometric mean concentration of T-Hg and mean concentration of Me-Hg in rice samples collected from 3 villages in Wanshan Hg mining area were 36.2 ( ranging from 4.9 to 214.7 ) , and 8.5 ( ranging from 1.9 to 27.6 ) microg/kg , respectively , which were significantly elevated compared to the rice samples collected from a reference area , where the mean T-Hg and Me-Hg concentrations were 7.0 ( 3.2-15.1 ) and 2.5 ( 0.8-4.3 ) microg/kg , respectively .
Pork meat , vegetable , and drinking water samples collected in Wanshan Hg mining area contained highly elevated T-Hg , but very low levels of Me-Hg .
The relationships between the estimated rice Me-Hg intake and hair Me-Hg levels ( r = 0.65 , p < 0.001 ) confirmed rice with high Me-Hg levels indeed was the main route of Me-Hg exposure for the local residents in the Wanshan Hg mining area .
From our study , we can conclude that the main human exposure to Me-Hg via food consumption is not restricted to fish , but in some cases in mining areas of China to frequent rice meals .
