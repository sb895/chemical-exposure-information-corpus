Since the metals deposited in teeth during formation and mineralization processes are to a large extent retained , human teeth receive a considerable attention as the indicators of the heavy metal exposure .
The use of permanent teeth is limited because the extraction of healthy permanent teeth just for this purpose is hardly acceptable .
As the issue of the loss of elements from a carious lesion in the coronal part of a tooth remains controversial , the valuable material could only be the root of carious and fractured permanent teeth .
However , to ensure the validity of the results , it should be ascertained that the levels of certain toxic and essential elements do not differ significantly between the roots of non-carious and carious teeth , and therefore this is the aim of this project .
The levels of cadmium , chromium , copper , iron , manganese , lead , zinc , potassium , sodium , calcium and magnesium were determined in the roots of 344 permanent teeth ( 189 carious and 155 caries-free teeth ) from the residents of Ruda Slaska , Poland , aged 18 to 34 .
No statistically significant difference between the concentration of these metals in the roots of non-carious and carious teeth was found .
This finding applies to both the general population and after the grouping by donor's gender and tooth type .
The concentration of lead , iron , calcium and manganese in the roots of non-carious and carious teeth exhibited dependence upon tooth type , as well as the concentration of potassium in the roots of carious teeth .
Since the mineral composition of the roots of permanent teeth is similar for the non-carious , as well as the carious teeth , they can be indiscriminately selected for the tests required by a research project , as they will produce the comparable results .
However , in the case of lead , iron , calcium , potassium and manganese , the comparison should be made after grouping by tooth type .
