In 2006 , levels of seven indicator polychlorinated biphenyl congeners ( PCB28 , 52 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 , and 180 ) in blood serum of 202 blood donors residing for more than 2 years in five urban areas included in the Czech Human Biomonitoring project were measured by GC/MS/MS method .
PCB congeners 138 , 153 and 180 accounted for about 97% of the sum of the indicator congeners analyzed .
Overall , the median and 95th percentile of the most abundant congener PCB 153 were 438 ng/g lipid and 1079 ng/g lipid , respectively .
The highest median levels were found in Uhersk√© Hradiste ( 669 ng/g lipid ) and Ostrava ( 672 ng/g lipid in males compared to 341 ng/g lipid in females ) .
Serum PCB concentrations were significantly associated with age , gender , place of residence and smoking habit , but not with body mass index and education .
The results suggest the importance of PCB body burden in the Czech general population and the existence of hot spots .
