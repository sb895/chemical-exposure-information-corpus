Owing to data collection challenges , the vertical variation in population in cities and particulate air pollution are typically not accounted for in exposure assessments , which may lead to misclassification of exposures based on elevation of residency .
To better assess this misclassification , the vertical distribution of the potentially highly exposed population ( PHEP ) , defined as all residents within the 100-m buffer zone of above-ground highways or the 200-m buffer zone of a highway-tunnel exit , was estimated for four floor categories in Boston's Chinatown ( MA , USA ) using the three-dimensional digital geography methodology .
Vertical profiles of particle number concentration ( 7-3000\u2009nm ; PNC ) and particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) mass concentration were measured by hoisting instruments up the vertical face of an 11-story ( 35-m ) building near the study area throughout the day on multiple days .
The concentrations from all the profiles ( n=23 ) were averaged together for each floor category .
As measurement elevation increased from 0 to 35\u2009m PNC decreased by 7.7% , compared with 3.6% for PM2.5 .
PHEP was multiplied by the average PNC for each floor category to assess exposures for near-highway populations .
The results show that adding temporally-averaged vertical air pollution data had a small effect on residential ambient exposures for our study population ; however , greater effects were observed when individual days were considered ( e.g. , winds were off the highways).Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication , 2 October 2013 ; doi:10.1038/jes.2013.64 .
