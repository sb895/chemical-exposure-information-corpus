BACKGROUND High incidence of gallbladder cancer ( GBC ) is reported from North India , with elevated concentrations of heavy metals in water and soil .
This Indo-Japan collaborative study compared presence of heavy metals in gallbladder tissues .
METHODS Heavy metal concentrations were estimated in Indian GBC and cholecystitis tissues and compared with Japanese GBC and cholecystitis tissues .
Spectrophotometry was done for 13 Indian gallbladder tissues ( 8 GBC , 5 cholecystitis ) and 9 Japanese ( 5 GBC , 4 cholecystitis ) .
Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) thin foil element analysis was done in 10 Indian samples ( 6 GBC , 4 cholecystitis ) .
RESULTS Chromium , lead , arsenic and zinc were significantly high in Indian GBC compared with Japanese GBC .
Chromium , lead and arsenic were significantly high in the Indian cholecystitis tissues compared to the Japanese .
TEM of Indian tissues demonstrated electron dense deposits in GBC .
CONCLUSION Heavy metals- chromium , lead , arsenic and zinc are potential carcinogens in Indian GBC from endemic areas .
This preliminary study links presence of heavy metals in gallbladder cancer tissues in endemic areas .
