The study is a part of an ongoing prospective cohort study on the relationship between the exposure to environmental factors during pregnancy and birth outcomes and health of newborns .
We have measured personal PM(2.5) level in the group of 407 non-smoking pregnant women during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy .
On average , the participants from the city center were exposed to higher exposure than those from the outer city area ( GM=42.0 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 36.8-48.0 vs. 35.8 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 33.5-38.2 microg/m(3) ) .
More than 20% of study subjects were affected by high level of PM(2.5) pollution ( above 65 microg/m(3) ) .
PM(2.5) concentrations were higher during the heating season ( GM=43.4 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 40.1-46.9 microg/m(3) ) compared to non-heating season ( GM=29.8 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 27.5-32.2 microg/m(3) ) .
Out of all potential outdoor air pollution sources ( high traffic density , bus depot , waste incinerator , industry etc. ) considered in the bivariate analysis , only the proximity of industrial plant showed significant impact on the personal exposure ( GM=54.3 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 39.4-74.8 microg/m(3) ) compared with corresponding figure for those who did not declare living near the industrial premises ( GM=36.2 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 34.1-38.4 microg/m(3) ) .
The subjects declaring high exposure to ETS ( >10 cigarettes daily ) have shown very high level of personal exposure ( GM=88.8 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 73.9-106.7 microg/m(3) ) compared with lower ETS exposure ( < or =10 cigarettes ) ( GM=46.3 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 40.0-53.5 microg/m(3) ) and no-ETS exposure group ( GM=33.9 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 31.8-36.1 microg/m(3) ) .
The contribution of the background ambient PM(10) level was very strong determinant of the total personal exposure to PM(2.5) and it explained about 31% of variance between the subjects followed by environmental tobacco smoke ( 10% ) , home heating by coal/wood stoves ( 2% ) , other types of heating ( 2% ) and the industrial plant localization in the proximity of household ( 1% ) .
