Saliva and urine are proposed for cadmium monitoring of non-smokers , second hand smokers , smokers and tobacco chewing appertaining to San Luis citizens without occupational exposition .
Biological samples were collected by the same subjects , under strict proceeding instructions of sampling .
Physical characteristics of samples were observed and checked with commercial test .
Samples were analyzed using an adapted molecular fluorescence methodology with a previous extraction step .
Stability of biological samples was daily studied for a period of one month .
The method was successfully validated for accuracy , precision , linearity , specificity , and sensitivity .
The simplicity and low coefficient of variance confirm the suitability of the method for urinary and salivary cadmium analyses .
On the other side , the obtained results are in concordance with previous national epidemiological dates .
