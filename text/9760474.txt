The rapid industrialization in Taiwan has caused both prosperity and environmental pollution .
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a case of both occupational and environmental lead poisoning .
A patient of lead poisoning initiated a survey of the battery recycling factory , which revealed that 31 of 64 workers suffered from lead poisoning .
Children who attended a nearby kindergarten showed a significant increase of blood lead up to 15-25 micrograms/dl and a mild but significant decrease of IQ ( intelligent quotient , by Binet-Simon scale ) if compared with children of a nonexposed but socioeconomically comparable kindergarten .
Outdoor workers of the nearby forging factory also showed a significant increase of blood lead if compared with indoor workers or workers of another nonexposed forging factory 20 Km away .
Air sampling showed an average of more than 10 micrograms/m3 in the kindergarten .
Soil sampling and analysis also revealed 400 folds increase of lead content , which decreased if the sample was taken deep down to 15-30 cm or 350 meters away from the battery recycling smelter .
Moreover , after children were moved away from the pollution source , follow-up examination performed 2.5 years later showed a significant decrease of blood lead and partial recovery of IQ among them .
