To investigate the occupational exposure levels to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) , polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , indoor dust dust ( n = 3 ) in workshops and hair samples from male workers ( n = 64 ) were collected at two electrical and electronic equipmentwaste ( E-waste ) dismantling factories located in the LQ area in east China in July 11--13 , 2006 .
Pre- and postworkshift urines ( 64 of each ) were also collected from the workers to study oxidative damage to DNA using 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) as a biomarker .
The concentrations of PCDD/Fs , PCDD/F-WHO-TEQs , PBDEs , PCBs and PCB-WHO-TEQs were ( 50.0 +/- 8.1 ) x 10(3) , 724.1 +/- 249.6 , ( 27.5 +/- 5.8 ) x 10(6) , ( 1.6 +/- 0.4 ) x 10(9) , ( 26.2 +/- 3.0 ) x 10(3) pg/g dry weight ( dw ) in dust , and ( 2.6 +/- 0.6 ) x 10(3),42.4 +/- 9.3 , ( 870.8 +/- 205.4 ) x 10(3) , ( 1.6 +/- 0.2 ) x 10(6) , 41.5 +/- 5.5 pg/g dw in hair , respectively .
The homologue and congener profiles in the samples demonstrated that high concentrations of PCDD/Fs , PBDEs , and PCBs were originated from open burning of E-waste .
The 8-OHdG levels were detected at 6.40 +/- 1.64 micromol/mol creatinine in preworkshift urines .
However , the levels significantly increased to 24.55 +/- 5.96 micromol/mol creatinine in postworkshift urines ( p < 0.05 ) .
Then , it is concluded that there is a high cancer risk originated from oxidative stress indicated by the elevated 8-OHdG levels in the E-waste dismantling workers exposed to high concentrations of PCDD/Fs , PBDEs , and PCBs .
