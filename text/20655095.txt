MeHg is a well-documented neurotoxicant even at low levels of exposure .
Developing brain , in particular , is vulnerable to that .
Through bioaccumulating to differing degrees in various fish species , it can have serious adverse effects on the development and functioning of the human central nervous system , especially during prenatal exposure .
Therefore , the purpose of this study was to investigate mercury concentration in hair samples of pregnant women living in Mahshahr located in Khuzestan province , Iran .
It assessed the association between fish consumption and specific characteristics that can influence exposure .
From April to June 2008 , 149 pregnant women were invited to participate in this study .
An interview administered questionnaire was used to collect information about age , body weight , height , fish ( fresh , canned and shrimp ) consumption , pregnancy stage , residence duration , education level , family income and number of dental amalgam fillings .
The obtained results showed that the geometric mean and range for hair total Hg concentration was 3.52 microg/g ( 0.44-53.56 microg/g ) .
About 5.4% of mothers had hair total Hg levels in excess of 10 microg/g .
Maternal hair mercury level was less than threshold level of WHO ( 5 microg/g ) .
As expected , there was a clear increase in hair Hg with reported fresh marine fish consumption ( p=0.04 ) .
The highest mean for hair mercury level in a group who consumed fish several times per week , was 4.93 microg/g .
Moreover , a significant effect of age and residential time on Hg concentration in the hair of the women was found .
Pregnant women in Mahshahr consumed large amounts of fish ; consequently , most of their offspring were prenatally exposed to moderately high levels of mercury .
The results found suggest that pregnant women should decrease their fish consumption .
