Dioxins ( PCDD + PCDF ) and polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) are potentially hazardous compounds and have structural similarity to thyroid hormones .
Our research group on " Dioxins and PCB in Human Milk " was organized in 1997 and has been active for the past three years .
We collected breast milk from 80 mothers living in Tokyo , Saitama , Ishikawa and Osaka Prefecture in Japan at 5 , 30 , 150 , 300 postpartum days and measured PCDDs , PCDFs and PCBs during 1998-1999 .
We added another 20 prefectures and cities during 1999-2000 .
Breast milk was obtained from 415 mothers at 30 postpartum days ( breast-feeding group ) .
Blood was taken from infants who were breast-fed at the age of 1 year for evaluation of thyroid and immune functions .
Blood was also taken from 53 infants who were bottle-fed ( bottle-feeding group ) as a control .
Serum T4 , T3 , FT4 and TSH levels in the breast-feeding ( n = 337 ) and bottle-feeding ( n = 53 ) groups were within normal ranges and were not significantly different between the two groups .
Although there were a large geographic differences of dioxins and co-PCB content in breast milk , there were no differences in serum T4 , T3 , FT4 , TSH levels and no significant correlation between the mean serum levels of TSH and TEQ in breast milk .
There was a significant correlation between serum TSH at 1 year of age and that from blood on dried filter paper TSH at 5 days of age .
We concluded that dioxin intake from breast milk in Japanese infants did not impair thyroid function .
However , long-term effects remain to be evaluated .
