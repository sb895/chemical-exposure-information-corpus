BACKGROUND , AIM AND SCOPE This study is the first to investigate PBDE body burden with regard to the concurrent analyses of multiple human matrices , namely milk , placenta , and hair , collected from a group of childbearing-aged women at an electronic waste ( e-waste ) recycling site to determine the partitioning of PBDEs in these different human matrices and the possible health risks imposed to infants at the e-waste recycling site .
METHODS AND METHODS Five sets of milk , placenta , and hair samples were collected from an e-waste site ( Taizhou , Zhejiang Province ) and a reference site ( Lin'an city , Zhejiang Province ; 245 km away from Taizhou ) in China .
The concentrations of total PBDEs in different human tissues were analyzed according to US EPA standard methods .
RESULTS PBDE body burdens of women from the e-waste site ( milk 117 +/- 191 , 8.89-457 ng/g fat , placenta 19.5 +/- 29.9 , 1.28-72.1 ng/g fat , hair 110 +/- 210 , 8.47-486 ng/g dry wt. ) showed significantly higher levels than those from the reference site ( milk 2.06 +/- 0.94 , 1.0-3.56 ng/g fat , placenta 1.02 +/- 0.36 , 0.59-1.42 ng/g fat , hair 3.57 +/- 2.03 , 1.56-5.61 ng/g dry wt. ) and were higher than those reported in other studies , due to e-waste recycling operations , especially open burning .
On a dry-weight basis , the following trend was found for PBDE among the samples from Taizhou : hair>milk>placenta .
Among the donors , the body burden of an e-waste worker ranked second .
Higher brominated BDEs ( hepta-BDEs ) contributed a significantly greater proportion to total PBDEs in hair of the Taizhou women ( 20% ) than that in milk ( 2.9% ) and in placenta ( 2.6% ) .
The estimated intake of PBDEs of 6-month-old breastfed infants living at the e-waste site was 572 +/- 839 ng/kg body wt/day , which was 57 times higher than that of infants from the reference site ( 10.1 +/- 4.60 ng/kg body wt/day ) .
Moreover , the maximum calculated value ( 2,240 ng/kg body wt/day ) exceeded the chronic oral reference dose for penta-BDE ( 2,000 ng/kg/day ) of US EPA .
DISCUSSION BDE-47 was the dominant congener accounting for 20-30% in all the individual samples , while higher-brominated congeners , for example , BDE-183 and BDE-190 , contributed between 2% and 20% .
The presence of hepta-BDE congeners ( BDE-181 , BDE-190 ) in hair of the women in Taizhou suggest that thermal degradation of Deca-BDE from the open burning of e-waste may have been their source because these congeners are not found in either Penta-BDE or Octa-BDE technical products .
Of the three types of samples analyzed , it was also suspected that hair may be more favorable to higher-brominated compounds which might explain why the hair samples contained the highest total PBDE concentrations and the highest proportion of higher-brominated BDEs ( hepta-BDEs ) .
CONCLUSION This study provides evidence that primitive e-waste recycling in China leads to high PBDE body burdens in local residents and can potentially threaten the health of infants .
RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES Control measures should be imposed to minimize the level of pollutants resulting from e-waste processing operations to the environment and to humans .
In-depth investigations on epidemiological studies of health impacts caused by e-waste recycling operations should be conducted .
It is recommended that further measurements of PBDE levels in local food ( e.g. , fish , shellfish , dairy products , meat , fruits , and vegetables ) , dust , air , water , and human specimens be collected from a larger sample size at the e-waste processing site for the determination of human exposure pathways to PBDEs .
