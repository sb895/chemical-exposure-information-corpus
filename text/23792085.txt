The dietary exposure of infants to polychlorinated dibenzo dioxins and furans ( PCDD/Fs ) and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls ( dl-PCBs ) is an issue of great social impact .
We investigated for the first time the dietary intake of these compounds in infants living in Greece .
We included in our study two age groups : 0-6 months , when infants are fed exclusively by human milk and/or formula milk , and 6 to 12 months , when solid food is introduced to nutrition .
We took into consideration analytical results for PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs concentrations in the most popular infant formulae in the Greek market , previous data for mother milk concentrations of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs from Greece , and finally analytical data for fat-containing food products from the Greek market .
In the first study group , it was found than in infants exclusively fed by breast milk , the calculated sum of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs ( 60.3-80.4 TEQ pg/kg body weight ) was significantly higher than that of infants that consume a combination of human milk and formula ( 31.2-41.6 TEQ pg/kg body weight ) .
In the second study group , separate daily intake estimations were performed for babies receiving human milk ( estimated total daily intake 19.76-24.95 TEQ pg/kg body weight ) and formula milk ( estimated total daily intake 1.60-2.24 TEQ pg/kg body weight ) .
The risks of this exposure should not be overestimated because nursing is restricted to a limited period of human life and besides , the potential consumption of higher levels of dioxin-like compounds is fully compensated by the significant benefits of breast-feeding .
