In response to concerns regarding arsenic in soil from a pesticide manufacturing plant , we conducted a biomonitoring study on children younger than 7 years of age , the age category of children most exposed to soil .
Urine samples from 77 children ( 47% participation rate ) were analyzed for total arsenic and arsenic species related to ingestion of inorganic arsenic .
Older individuals also provided urine ( n = 362 ) and toenail ( n = 67 ) samples .
Speciated urinary arsenic levels were similar between children ( geometric mean , geometric SD , and range : 4.0 , 2.2 , and 0.89-17.7 microg/L , respectively ) and older participants ( 3.8 , 1.9 , 0.91-19.9 microg/L ) and consistent with unexposed populations .
Toenail samples were < 1 mg/kg .
Correlations between speciated urinary arsenic and arsenic in soil ( r = 0.137 , p = 0.39 ; n = 41 ) or house dust ( r = 0.049 , p = 0.73 ; n = 52 ) were not significant for children .
Similarly , questionnaire responses indicating soil exposure were not associated with increased urinary arsenic levels .
Relatively low soil arsenic exposure likely precluded quantification of arsenic exposure above background .
