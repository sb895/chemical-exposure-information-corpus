This study examined the levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDE ) in the umbilical cord blood of infants , and investigated the relationship between PBDE concentration and thyroid hormone levels .
The concentration of PBDE were measured in the cord blood samples of 108 infants collected in Cheil Woman's Hospital , Seoul , Korea , in 2007 .
Of 108 pregnant woman reported , the average age was 31.9 +/- 3.54 yr ( range 20-42 yr ) .
The mean body weight of the infants was 3.15 +/- 0.57 kg ( 1.89-4.43 kg ) , and no birth defects were documented .
The concentrations of the total PBDEs ( 7 congeners ) found in the umbilical cord blood averaged 8.377 +/- 6.381 ng/g lipid , ranging from not determined ( ND ) to 29.407 ng/g lipid .
Of the seven congeners detected , BDE-47 ( 4.571 +/- 2.903 ng/g lipid ) accounted for the majority ( 38% of total PBDE ) of total PBDE , followed in descending order by BDE-153 ( 3.080 +/- 2.231 ng/g lipid ) and BDE-183 ( 2.933 +/- 2.386 ) .
There was no apparent correlation between the serum PBDE levels and thyroid hormone concentrations .
Similarly , there was no apparent relationship between the infant thyroxine ( T4 ) levels and four prevalent PBDE congener concentrations .
Data suggest that the concentration of PBDE in umbilical cord blood of Korean infants is similar to or lower than concentrations reported from North America .
In addition , PBDE readily crossed the blood placenta barrier .
Therefore , further study on the relationship between the maternal and fetal blood concentrations of PBDE is recommended for a more comprehensive exposure assessment of PBDE in Koreans .
