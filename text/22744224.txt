Arsenic ( As ) and lead ( Pb ) were determined in hair of 12 adult women and 27 children living in a soil-metal contaminated community in Puerto Rico .
Average concentrations in residential soils ranged from 24 to 109 \u03bcg/g for As and from 42 to 1,585 \u03bcg/g for Pb .
For hair-As , about 75% of the samples were below 0.08 \u03bcg/g .
Hair-Pb presented levels of health concern , with 10% of the samples above a reference value of 5 \u03bcg/g , indicating significant exposure to Pb .
Multivariate analyses revealed that children's Pb hair levels were predicted by age and sex , while consumption of home-grown animals influenced the association with soil-Pb .
