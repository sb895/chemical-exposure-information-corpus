BACKGROUND Several studies have linked biomass cooking fuel with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm births , low birth weight and post-neonatal infant mortality , but very few have studied the associations with cooking fuel independent of other factors associated with stillbirths .
METHOD We analyzed the data from 188,917 ever-married women aged 15-49 included in India's 2003-2004 District Level Household Survey-II to investigate the association between household use of cooking fuels ( liquid petroleum gas/electricity , kerosene , biomass ) and risk of stillbirth .
Prevalence ratios ( PRs ) were obtained using Poisson regression with robust standard errors after controlling for several potentially confounding factors ( socio-demographic and maternal health characteristics ) .
RESULTS Risk factors significantly associated with occurrence of stillbirth in the Poisson regression with robust standard errors model were : literacy status of the mother and father , lighting fuel and cooking fuel used , gravida status , history of previous abortion , whether the woman had an antenatal check up , age at last pregnancy >35 years , labor complications , bleeding complications , fetal and other complications , prematurity and home delivery .
After controlling the effect of these factors , women who cook with firewood ( PR 1.24 ; 95% CI : 1.08-1.41 , p=0.003 ) or kerosene ( PR 1.36 ; 95% CI : 1.10-1.67 , p=0.004 ) were more likely to have experienced a stillbirth than those who cook with LPG/electricity .
Kerosene lamp use was also associated with stillbirths compared to electric lighting ( PR 1.15 ; 95% CI : 1.06-1.25 , p=0.001 ) .
The population attributable risk of firewood as cooking fuel for stillbirths in India was 11% and 1% for kerosene cooking .
CONCLUSION Biomass and kerosene cooking fuels are associated with stillbirth occurrence in this population sample .
Assuming these associations are causal , about 12% of stillbirths in India could be prevented by providing access to cleaner cooking fuel .
