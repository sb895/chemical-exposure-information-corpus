Human exposure to individual polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) congeners and dichloro-diphenyldichloroethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) through food ( duplicate diets ) and indoor dust ingestion was assessed for 19 Belgian students .
The serum concentrations of the persistent PCB congeners in serum ( PCB 118 , 138 , 153 , 170 , and 180 ) have been correlated with the individual intake through food and dust .
Dietary intakes of SigmaPCBs ranged between 40 and 204 ng/day ( median 133 ) .
PCB exposure through dust ingestion ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 ng/day ( median 0.3 ) or 0.3 and 1.7 ng/day ( median 0.8 ) , assuming average dust ingestion ( 20 mg/day ) and high dust ingestion rates ( 50 mg/day ) , respectively .
Dietary intake of p,p'-DDE was comparable to that of PCBs with a range from 21 to 214 ng/day ( median 92 ) .
The exposure to p,p'-DDE via dust ingestion ranged between 0.02 and 0.43 ng/day ( median 0.17 ) or 0.05 and 1.09 ng/day ( median 0.43 ) , assuming average and high dust ingestion rates , respectively .
Concentrations measured in blood serum were 28-153 ng/g lipid weight ( lw ) ( median 74 ) and 32-264 ng/g lw ( median 45 ) for SigmaPCBs and p,p'-DDE , respectively .
Serum concentrations in the studied population are slightly lower compared to other European populations .
In spite of the uncertainty associated with the dust ingestion rates , food was the predominant exposure pathway for each PCB congener and for p,p'-DDE in the studied population .
Food intake contributed more than 99% of the combined PCB intake from food and dust .
No significant positive correlations ( p > 0.05 ) were observed between the serum concentrations of PCBs and p,p'-DDE and the total intake through food and dust for each participant .
Instead , it is hypothesized that past and episodic higher current intakes are more important determinants of body burden than continuous background exposures at low levels .
