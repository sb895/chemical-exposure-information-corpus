In animals , perfluorinated chemicals ( PFCs ) , specifically perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfate ( PFOS ) , function as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) alpha agonists .
However , the relevance of animal ( primarily rodent ) data to humans is unresolved .
While plasma adiponectin level is very responsive to PPAR gamma agonist drugs , it has not been determined whether adiponectin level is related to serum PFCs concentrations .
In the present study , 287 subjects ( 12-30 years of age ) were recruited to determine the relationship between serum level of PFCs and serum level of adiponectin .
The results showed males had higher serum PFOS concentrations than females and that those with metabolic syndrome had lower serum PFOA than controls .
Besides , it showed regional elevations of the perfluoroundecanoic acid ( PFUA ) ( median concentration : 7.11 ng/mL ) in the study subjects .
No relationship of PFOA , PFOS , PFUA , and the sum of all four PFCs was found to glucose homeostasis , adiponectin level , lipid profile , and inflammatory markers .
The median and the range of perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) concentration ( in ng/mL ; for four categories corresponding to the <50 , 50-74 , 75-89 , and \u226590th percentiles ) were 0.38 ( 0.38-1.68 ) , 3.22 ( 1.73-4.65 ) , 5.85 ( 4.75-8.29 ) , 10.56 ( 8.40-25.40 ) , respectively .
After controlling for confounding factors , multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the mean natural log-transformed level of adiponectin increased significantly across categories of PFNA ( in ng/mL ; 8.78 , 8.73 , 9.06 , 9.36 ; P for trend = 0.010 in the full model ) .
In conclusion , higher serum PFNA concentration is associated with elevated serum adiponectin concentration .
