Consumption of fish and shellfish from contaminated areas may be an important source of human exposure to persistent organohalogen compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) .
We determined concentrations of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDDs and PCDFs and 19 PCB congeners in whole blood samples from three groups of men , 40-54 years of age , with different consumption levels of crabs from a fjord area in southern Norway polluted with organochlorine compounds from a magnesium production plant .
A significant increase of many PCDD/PCDF congeners was found in the blood when comparing the referents , moderate- , and high-intake groups .
The greatest difference was observed for several of the PCDFs that are characteristic for the contamination of the marine biota of the fjord .
PCBs , in general , play a minor role in the contamination of the fjord by the magnesium production process , except for the highly chlorinated congeners such as PCB-209 .
Nevertheless , almost all PCBs increased from the referents to the high-intake group .
However , the relative concentrations of several highly chlorinated PCBs ( particularly PCB-209 ) in blood are unexpectedly low compared to their abundance in crabs , indicating low uptake of these congeners .
The exposure to PCDDs/PCDFs from crab consumption calculated from individual body burdens of these compounds were in good agreement with the intake estimated from previously measured concentrations in crabs , reported fishing sites , and consumption .
Almost all subjects in the high-intake group exceeded the tolerable weekly intake of 35 pg TEQ/kg body weight/week proposed by a Nordic Expert Group .
