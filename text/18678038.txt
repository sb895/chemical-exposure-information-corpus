In 2000 , 3M Company , the primary global manufacturer , announced a phase-out of perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride ( POSF , C8F17SO2F)-based materials after perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS , C8F17SO3- ) was reported in human populations and wildlife .
The purpose of this study was to determine whether PFOS and other polyfluoroalkyl concentrations in plasma samples , collected in 2006 from six American Red Cross adult blood donor centers , have declined compared to nonpaired serum samples from the same locations in 2000-2001 .
For each location , 100 samples were obtained evenly distributed by age ( 20-69 years ) and sex .
Analytes measured , using tandem mass spectrometry , were PFOS , perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) , perfluorobutanesulfonate ( PFBS ) , N-methyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate ( Me-PFOSA-AcOH ) , and N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate ( Et-PFOSA-AcOH ) .
The geometric mean plasma concentrations were for PFOS 14.5 ng/mL ( 95% CI 13.9-15.2 ) , PFOA 3.4 ng/ mL ( 95% CI 3.3-3.6 ) , and PFHxS 1.5 ng/mL ( 95% CI 1.4-1.6 ) .
The majority of PFBS , Me-PFOSA-AcOH , and Et-PFOSA-AcOH concentrations were less than the lower limit of quantitation .
Age- and sex-adjusted geometric means were lower in 2006 ( approximately 60% for PFOS , 25% for PFOA , and 30% for PFHxS ) than those in 2000-2001 .
The declines for PFOS and PFHxS are consistent with their serum elimination half-lives and the time since the phase-out of POSF-based materials .
The shorter serum elimination half-life for PFOA and its smaller percentage decline than PFOS suggests PFOA concentrations measured in the general population are unlikely to be solely attributed to POSF-based materials .
Direct and indirect exposure sources of PFOA could include historic and ongoing electrochemical cell fluorination ( ECF ) of PFOA , telomer production of PFOA , fluorotelomer-based precursors , and other fluoropoly-mer production .
