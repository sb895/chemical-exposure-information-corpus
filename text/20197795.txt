Flanders is densely populated with much industry and intensive farming .
Sexual maturation of adolescents ( aged 14-15 years ) was studied in relation to internal exposure to pollutants .
Serum levels of pollutants and sex hormones were measured in 1679 participants selected as a random sample of the adolescents residing in the study areas .
Data on sexual development were obtained from the medical school examination files .
Self-assessment questionnaires provided information on health , use of medication and lifestyle factors .
In boys , serum levels of hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , p,p'-DDE and polychlorinated biphenyls ( sum of marker PCB138 , 153 and 180 ) were significantly and positively associated with pubertal staging ( pubic hair and genital development ) .
Higher levels of serum HCB and blood lead were associated with , respectively , a lower and a higher risk of gynecomastia .
In girls , significant and negative associations were detected between blood lead and pubic hair development ; higher exposure to PCBs was significantly associated with a delay in timing of menarche .
Environmental exposures to pollutants at levels actually present in the Flemish population are associated with measurable effects on pubertal development .
However , further understanding of toxic mode of action and sensitive windows of exposure is needed to explain the current findings .
