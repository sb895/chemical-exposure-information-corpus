BACKGROUND Several studies have found an effect on mortality of between-city contrasts in long-term exposure to air pollution .
The effect of within-city contrasts is still poorly understood .
OBJECTIVES We studied the association between long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and mortality in a Dutch cohort .
METHODS We used data from an ongoing cohort study on diet and cancer with 120,852 subjects who were followed from 1987 to 1996 .
Exposure to black smoke ( BS ) , nitrogen dioxide , sulfur dioxide , and particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm ( PM(2.5) ) , as well as various exposure variables related to traffic , were estimated at the home address .
We conducted Cox analyses in the full cohort adjusting for age , sex , smoking , and area-level socioeconomic status .
RESULTS Traffic intensity on the nearest road was independently associated with mortality .
Relative risks ( 95% confidence intervals ) for a 10-microg/m(3) increase in BS concentrations ( difference between 5th and 95th percentile ) were 1.05 ( 1.00-1.11 ) for natural cause , 1.04 ( 0.95-1.13 ) for cardiovascular , 1.22 ( 0.99-1.50 ) for respiratory , 1.03 ( 0.88-1.20 ) for lung cancer , and 1.04 ( 0.97-1.12 ) for mortality other than cardiovascular , respiratory , or lung cancer .
Results were similar for NO(2) and PM(2.5) , but no associations were found for SO(2) .
CONCLUSIONS Traffic-related air pollution and several traffic exposure variables were associated with mortality in the full cohort .
Relative risks were generally small .
Associations between natural-cause and respiratory mortality were statistically significant for NO(2) and BS .
These results add to the evidence that long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with increased mortality .
