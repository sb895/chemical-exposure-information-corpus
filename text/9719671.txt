As methylmercury is excreted in human milk and infants are particularly susceptible to toxicity due to this compound , the purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible transfer of methylmercury to infants via breast-feeding .
In a community with a high intake of seafood , 583 children from a birth cohort were followed .
The duration of nursing was recorded , and hair samples were obtained for mercury analysis at approximately 12 months of age .
The hair mercury concentrations increased with the length of the nursing period , and those nursed throughout the first year showed the highest geometric mean ( 9.0 nmol/g or 1.8 microg/g ) .
Human milk therefore seems to be an important source of methylmercury exposure in infants .
An increasing time interval from weaning to hair sample collection was not associated with any detectable decrease in mercury concentrations .
A slow or absent elimination of methylmercury during the first year after birth could explain this finding .
In certain fishing communities , infants nursed for long periods may be at increased risk of developing methylmercury toxicity .
