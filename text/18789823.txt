Brominated flame retardants ( BFRs ) represented by polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) together with major persistent organochlorine pollutants , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and selected organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) , were determined in adipose tissue samples ( n=98 ) obtained by liposuction of Czech subjects .
Compared to other organochlorine pollutants ( mostly PCBs and DDTs ) , levels of PBDE were lower by 2 orders of magnitude ranging from 0.2 to 54.3 ng/g lipid weight .
PBDE congeners No. 47 , 99 , 153 and 183 were the most abundant constituting up to 90% of these pollutants in adipose tissue .
The PBDEs content measured in this study was comparable with data reported in similar samples collected in Spain , Sweden , Belgium and Japan , whilst slightly lower than in the United States .
Regarding PCBs , the dominating congeners were No. 138 , 153 and 180 representing up to 90% of indicator congeners .
The levels of PCBs were similar to those found in other European countries .
While no age dependency was found for PBDEs , an increase of PCB and OCP levels with age was observed .
Different exposure routes of donors were documented by the absence of the relationship between PCBs and OCPs .
