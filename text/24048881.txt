This study characterizes the exposure of a typical Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur student to particulate matter and gaseous co-pollutants like carbon monoxide , volatile organic compounds , and nitrogen dioxide in various microenvironments , within and outside the college campus .
Chemical analysis of filter , used for the particulate matter measurement , was also carried out to determine the concentration of various elements such as Ca , Cd , Cr , Cu , Fe , Mg , Pb , Zn , and anions like F(-) , Cl(-) , NO3 ( - ) , and SO4 ( 2- ) .
Furthermore , time activity diary along with temperature data was maintained for the precise evaluation and analysis of results for various microenvironments .
The results showed PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations to be higher at some outdoor microenvironments , particularly near the Ganga riverbank .
From the chemical analysis , concentrations of chloride and fluoride were found higher in indoor microenvironments as compared to outdoors .
Also , nitrate concentrations were quite higher within the laboratory premises .
Concentrations of Ca , Fe , and Mg were significant outdoors , whereas Na , Ca , Fe , and K were prominent indoors .
The study highlights the real-time personal exposure of a student cohort to various toxic pollutants typically found within their breathing levels and their potential sources both indoors and outdoors .
