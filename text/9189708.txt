To assess the impact of elevated levels of inorganic mercury in soil and dust and organic mercury in fish , biological monitoring was conducted among Native Americans living next to an inactive mercury mine in Clear Lake , California .
Of resident tribal members , 46% ( n = 56 ) participated in biomonitoring .
Urine mercury levels are equivalent to background , indicating that soil and dust exposures among study participants are not substantial .
The average blood organic mercury level among study participants is 15.6 +/- 8.8 micrograms/l ( n = 44 ) , which is higher than levels reported by others among those who do not consume fish ( 2 micrograms/l ) .
Consistent with results from other studies , a correlation between fish consumption and blood organic mercury is observed ( p = 0.03 ) .
The margin between observed and established adverse effect levels for adults is examined for blood organic mercury and found to be less than 10-fold for 20% of the study population .
Protective public health efforts for the study population and other similarly exposed populations , notably those who consume commercial fish products , are considered .
