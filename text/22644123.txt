Organochorine ( OCs ) residues were measured in human breast milk samples from four Tunisian women .
Month-mix samples composed of weekly collected breast milk samples were analyzed over the lactation period between 3 days after delivery and 10 months post-partum .
The concentrations of dichlorodiphenytrichloroethane and its metabolites ( DDTs ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , hexachlorocyclohexane isomers ( HCHs ) , dieldrin , and 20 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners ( PCBs ) were determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detection .
The variation of OC residue levels in human milk was investigated for each woman individually .
The average p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT concentrations declined from 661- and 438-ng g(-1) fat basis at day 3 to 77- and 106-ng g(-1) fat basis after 8 months , respectively .
No essential changes in HCB , HCHs , dieldrin , and total PCBs concentrations in human breast milk occurred over the lactation periods investigated ; the concentrations remained either relatively constant or show no significant weak decrease .
