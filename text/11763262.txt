Selected persistent organochlorine pollutants , including PCBs , DDT and its metabolites ( DDTs ) and hexachlorocyclohexane isomers ( HCHs ) were determined in soil , animal fat and human serum samples from Romania .
All methods were rigorously tested and adequate quality control was ensured .
Soil samples from lassy County showed a lower contamination with organochlorines than samples from other Romanian regions .
While DDTs concentrations in soil were significantly higher at rural sites , only few samples ( three out of 47 ) exceeded the official Romanian norms for DDTs .
PCBs concentrations were low in rural sites ( < 8 ng/g soil ) , but rather high ( up to 134 ng/g soil ) in urban soils collected mostly from parks ( Bucharest , Arad , Baia Mare , Pitesti and Ploicsti ) .
Animal fat samples from lassy showed high concentrations of organochlorine pesticides ( HCHs concentrations up to 12370 ng/g fat ) , but similar PCB concentrations when compared with Arad samples .
Two samples ( from 24 ) exceeded the EU norms ( 1000 ng/g fat ) for HCHs and DDTs in animal fat .
Organochlorines were found in higher concentrations in some samples of human serum from Timisoara due to a broader age range .
Samples of human serum from lassy mothers showed higher HCHs and DDTs concentrations than samples from a similar group from Antwerp , Belgium .
HCB and PCBs were higher in Antwerp cohort .
Romanian samples showed a higher ratio DDT/sigmaDDTs , but similar ratios PCB 153/sigmaPCBs .
