There are few longitudinal studies on sick building syndrome ( SBS ) , which include ocular , nasal , throat , and dermal symptoms , headache , and fatigue .
We studied the associations between selected microbial components , fungal DNA , furry pet allergens , and incidence and remission of SBS symptoms in schools in Taiyuan , China .
The study was based on a two-year prospective analysis in pupils ( N=1143 ) in a random sample of schools in China .
Settled dust in the classrooms was collected by vacuum cleaning and analyzed for lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , muramic acid ( MuA ) , and ergosterol ( Erg ) .
Airborne dust was collected in Petri dishes and analyzed for cat and dog allergens and fungal DNA .
The relationship between the concentration of allergens and microbial compounds and new onset of SBS was analyzed by multi-level logistic regression .
The prevalence of mucosal and general symptoms was 33% and 28% , respectively , at baseline , and increased during follow-up .
At baseline , 27% reported at least one symptom that improved when away from school ( school-related symptoms ) .
New onset of mucosal symptoms was negatively associated with concentration of MuA , total LPS , and shorter lengths of 3-hydroxy fatty acids from LPS , C14 , C16 , and C18 .
Onset of general symptoms was negatively associated with C18 LPS .
Onset of school-related symptoms was negatively associated with C16 LPS , but positively associated with total fungal DNA .
In general , bacterial compounds ( LPS and MuA ) seem to protect against the development of mucosal and general symptoms , but fungal exposure measured as fungal DNA could increase the incidence of school-related symptoms .
