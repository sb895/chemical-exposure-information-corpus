Due to possible health risks , quantification of mercury accumulation in humans was included in the Flemish biomonitoring programmes FLEHS I ( 2002-2006 ) and FLEHS II ( 2007-2011 ) .
The general objective of FLEHS I was to assess regional exposure levels in order to link possible differences in these internal exposure levels to different types of local environmental pressure .
Therefore , Hg and MMHg ( methylmercury ) were only measured in pooled blood samples per region and per age class .
In FLEHS II , mercury concentrations were measured in hair of each participant .
About 200 adolescents and 250 mothers ( reference group ) and two times 200 adolescents ( 2 hotspots ) were screened .
The main objectives of the FLEHS II study were : ( 1 ) to determine reference levels of mercury in hair for Flanders ; ( 2 ) to assess relations between mercury exposure and possible sources like fish consumption ; ( 3 ) to assess dose-effect relations between mercury exposure and health effect markers .
The results showed that mercury concentrations in the Flemish population were rather low compared to other studies .
Mercury levels in the Flemish populations were strongly related to the age of the participants and consumption of fish .
Significant negative associations were observed between mercury in hair and asthma , having received breast feeding as a newborn , age at menarche in girls , allergy for animals and free testosterone levels .
Significant correlations were also observed between mercury in hair and genes JAK2 , ARID4A , Hist1HA4L ( boys ) and HLAdrb5 , PIAS2 , MANN1B1 , GIT and ABCA1 ( girls ) .
