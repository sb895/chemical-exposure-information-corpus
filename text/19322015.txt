Arsenic exposure is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer .
To explore the distribution of the arsenic methylation capability and myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) and sulfotransferase ( SULT ) 1A1 genotypes in patients at different stages and grades of urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) , 112 UC cases were recruited between September 2002 and May 2004 for this study .
Urinary arsenic species , including inorganic arsenic ( As(III) + As(V) ) , monomethylarsonic acid , and dimethylarsinic acid , were determined with a high-performance liquid chromatography-linked hydride generator and atomic absorption spectrometry .
The MPO and SULT1A1 genotypes were examined with polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism .
Differential effects of the arsenic methylation capability were found among patients with different stages of UC ; however , urinary arsenic concentrations were borderline significantly increased with the progress of UC patients regardless of whether or not they had been exposed to arsenic from drinking water .
The MPO and SULT genetic polymorphisms might modify the arsenic methylation profile and UC progression , and thus are worthy of further investigation .
