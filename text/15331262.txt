To assess the influence of a new hazardous waste incinerator ( HWI ) on public health , a preoperational monitoring program was established during the period of construction .
In this study , the levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDD ) and dibenzofurans ( PCDF ) accumulated in adipose tissue of 15 autopsied subjects living in the area under potential impact of the HWI were determined after approximately 3 years of regular operations in the facility .
The non-ortho PCBs 77 , 126 and 169 were also determined .
PCDD/F concentrations ranged between 1.5 and 41 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ( 2.4 and 72 WHO-TEQ/g fat , respectively , including PCBs ) , with a mean value of 11 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat and a median value of 7.4 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ( 22 and 13 WHO-TEQ/g fat , respectively , including PCBs ) .
In the baseline study , the mean level of PCDD/Fs was 36 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ( 61 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat , including non-ortho PCBs 77 , 126 and 169 ) , which means a reduction of 70% ( 64% including PCBs ) .
This notable reduction is in accordance with the important decrease observed in recent years in PCDD/F intake through the diet .
The current concentrations of PCDD/Fs in human adipose tissue , as well as recent data on PCDD/F levels in plasma and breast milk of subjects living in the vicinity of the same HWI , indicate that there is not any additional significant exposure to PCDD/Fs for this population .
