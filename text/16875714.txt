Many Bangladeshi suffer from arsenic-related health concerns .
Most mitigation activities focus on identifying contaminated wells and reducing the amount of arsenic ingested from well water .
Food as a source of arsenic exposure has been recently documented .
The objectives of this study were to measure the main types of arsenic in commonly consumed foods in Bangladesh and estimate the average daily intake ( ADI ) of arsenic from food and water .
Total , organic and inorganic , arsenic were measured in drinking water and in cooked rice and vegetables from Bangladeshi households .
The mean total arsenic level in 46 rice samples was 358 microg/kg ( range : 46 to 1,110 microg/kg dry weight ) and 333 microg/kg ( range : 19 to 2,334 microg/kg dry weight ) in 39 vegetable samples .
Inorganic arsenic calculated as arsenite and arsenate made up 87% of the total arsenic measured in rice , and 96% of the total arsenic in vegetables .
Total arsenic in water ranged from 200 to 500 microg/L .
Using individual , self-reported data on daily consumption of rice and drinking water the total arsenic ADI was 1,176 microg ( range : 419 to 2,053 microg ) , 14% attributable to inorganic arsenic in cooked rice .
The ADI is a conservative estimate ; vegetable arsenic was not included due to limitations in self-reported daily consumption amounts .
Given the arsenic levels measured in food and water and consumption of these items , cooked rice and vegetables are a substantial exposure pathway for inorganic arsenic .
Intervention strategies must consider all sources of dietary arsenic intake .
