Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as bisphenol A ( BPA ) and phthalates is prevalent among children and adolescents , but little is known regarding important sources of exposure at these sensitive life stages .
In this study , we measured urinary concentrations of BPA and nine phthalate metabolites in 108 Mexican children aged 8-13 years .
Associations of age , time of day , and questionnaire items on external environment , water use , and food container use with specific gravity-corrected urinary concentrations were assessed , as were questionnaire items concerning the use of 17 personal care products in the past 48-h .
As a secondary aim , third trimester urinary concentrations were measured in 99 mothers of these children , and the relationship between specific gravity-corrected urinary concentrations at these two time points was explored .
After adjusting for potential confounding by other personal care product use in the past 48-h , there were statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) positive associations in boys for cologne/perfume use and monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) , mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate ( MCPP ) , mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate ( MEHHP ) , and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate ( MEOHP ) , and in girls for colored cosmetics use and mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MBP ) , mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( MEHP ) , MEHHP , MEOHP , and mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate ( MECPP ) , conditioner use and MEP , deodorant use and MEP , and other hair products use and MBP .
There was a statistically significant positive trend for the number of personal care products used in the past 48-h and log-MEP in girls .
However , there were no statistically significant associations between the analytes and the other questionnaire items and there were no strong correlations between the analytes measured during the third trimester and at 8-13 years of age .
We demonstrated that personal care product use is associated with exposure to multiple phthalates in children .
Due to rapid development , children may be susceptible to impacts from exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals ; thus , reduced or delayed use of certain personal care products among children may be warranted .
