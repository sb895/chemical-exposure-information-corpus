OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to evaluate the health status of nearby residents of a wood treatment plant who had sustained prolonged low-level environmental exposure to wood processing waste chemicals .
METHODS A population of 1269 exposed residents who were plaintiffs or potential plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the wood treatment plant were evaluated by questionnaire for a health history and symptoms .
A representative sample of 214 exposed subjects was included in the analysis .
One hundred thirty-nine controls were selected from 479 unexposed volunteers and matched to the exposed subjects as closely as possible by gender and age .
Subjects and controls completed additional questionnaires and were evaluated by a physician for medical history and physical examination , blood and urine testing , neurophysiological and neuropsychological studies , and respiratory testing .
Environmental sampling for wood processing waste chemicals was carried out on soil and drainage ditch sediment in the exposed neighborhood .
RESULTS The exposed subjects had significantly more cancer , respiratory , skin , and neurological health problems than the controls .
The subjective responses on questionnaires and by physician histories revealed that the residents had a significantly greater prevalence of mucous membrane irritation , and skin and neurological symptoms , as well as cancer .
( Exposed versus unexposed , cancer 10.0% versus 2.08% , bronchitis 17.8% versus 5.8% , and asthma by history 40.5% versus 11.0% ) There were significantly more neurophysiologic abnormalities in adults of reaction time , trails A and B , and visual field defects .
CONCLUSIONS Adverse health effects were significantly more prevalent in long-term residents near a wood treatment plant than in controls .
The results of this study suggest that plant emissions from wood treatment facilities should be reduced .
