A French monitoring study was initiated to evaluate the exposure of fetus and newborn to brominated flame retardants ( BFR ) .
A previously developed multi-residue analytical method was used for measuring the main classes of BFR ( tetrabromobisphenol-A , and tri- to decabomodiphenyl ethers ) in various human biological matrices .
Analyzed samples ( maternal and cord serum , adipose tissue and breast milk ) were collected from 93 volunteer women during caesarean deliveries .
TBBPA was detected in 44% of the analyzed breast milk samples , at levels varying from 0.06 to 37.34 ng g(-1) lipid weight , but was not detected in adipose tissue .
This compound was also detected in 30% of the analyzed serum samples , with similar average values in maternal and cord serum ( 154 pg g(-1) fresh weight versus 199 pg g(-1) fresh weight , respectively ) .
The interpretation of the collected data permitted the demonstration of ( 1 ) a significant exposure to TBBPA both for mothers and fetuses and ( 2 ) a possible risk of overexposure of newborns through breastfeeding .
