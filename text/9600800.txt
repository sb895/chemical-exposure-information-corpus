The present study aimed to evaluate methylmercury in fish and human hair samples from an important hydroelectrical reservoir , Balbina ( Brazil , Amazon ) .
It presents a quite intense fishing activity and there is no known goldmining activity in its watershed .
Fish and human hair were analyzed with a new extraction technique and measured by GC-ECD .
Analytical quality was checked through intercomparisons between two laboratories with local samples and certified standards from IAEA .
Methylmercury in hair ranged from 2.0 to 21.6 microg . g-1 with a mean of 8.76+/-5.20 microg . g-1 ( N=20 ) , while the methylmercury percentages were above 90 .
Fish presented methylmercury levels ranging from 0.03 to 0.9 microg small middle dot g-1 wet wt with a mean of 0.24+/-0.18 microg small middle dot g-1 wet wt ( N=32 ) , which is below the limit established for food by Brazilian legislation ( 0.5 microg small middle dot g-1 wet wt ) and methylmercury mean percentages were above 95% .
The total mean daily methylmercury intake ranged from 11 to 55 microg for 70% of the sampled population from the village based on a daily consumption of about 110 g of fish with methylmercury concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 microg . g-1 .
This calculation is consistent with methylmercury concentrations in hair samples in the range of 2.6 to 13.1 microg . g-1 .
