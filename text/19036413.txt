Estimating personal exposure to air pollution is a crucial component in identifying high-risk populations and situations .
It will enable policy makers to determine efficient control strategies .
Cycling is again becoming a favorite mode of transport both in developing and in developed countries due to increasing traffic congestion and environmental concerns .
In Europe , it is also seen as a healthy sports activity .
However , due to high levels of hazardous pollutants in the present day road microenvironment the cyclist might be at a higher health risk due to higher breathing rate and proximity to the vehicular exhaust .
In this paper we present estimates of the exposure of a cyclist to particles of various size fractions including ultrafine particles ( UFP ) in the town of Mol ( Flanders , Belgium ) .
The results indicate relatively higher UFP concentration exposure during morning office hours and moderate UFP levels during afternoon .
The major sources of UFP and PM(10) were identified , which are vehicular emission and construction activities , respectively .
We also present a dust mapping technique which can be a useful tool for town planners and local policy makers .
