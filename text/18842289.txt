The Ria of Huelva ( south-west Spain ) is one of the most polluted fluvial-estuarine systems in the world .
Industrial activity delivers huge amounts of pollutants to the local environment , particularly heavy metals and arsenic .
Here we aimed to determine urinary levels of As , Cd , Cr , Cu and Ni in a representative sample ( n=857 ) of adults living in the Ria of Huelva .
Levels were compared to those from a representative sample of 861 adults of the general urban population of Andalusia ( southern Spain ) and multiple regression models were developed to identify individual factors associated with urinary levels of these elements .
Arsenic levels were significantly higher in the Ria of Huelva as compared to other Andalusian cities , whereas Cd and Ni levels were significantly lower .
Despite these differences , levels in both groups were similar to the reference values reported in previous studies for general population .
Age , gender , diet and lifestyle were the major factors contributing to the interindividual variation in urinary metals .
In conclusion , despite living in a highly polluted area , the population of the Ria of Huelva failed to show higher urinary levels of the studied metals as compared to a reference urban population of the same region .
