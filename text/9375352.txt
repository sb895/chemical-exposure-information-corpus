Hexachlorocyclohexanes ( HCHs ) , dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane and its metabolites ( DDTs ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDDs/DFs ) were determined in human adipose tissue samples collected from western Kyungnam , Korea .
The residue levels of organochlorine compounds were in the order of DDTs followed by PCBs > HCHs > HCB > PCDDs/DFs .
The mean concentrations of 2,3,7,8-TeCDD in male and female tissues were 2.8 and 1.7 pg.g-1 on lipid weight basis , respectively .
No significant difference was found in the residue levels of PCDDs/DFs between sexes .
In contrast , PCBs and DDTs showed a significant difference between sexes .
Unlike the age trend observed for HCHs , PCBs and DDTs , PCDDs/DFs revealed a constant or rather decreasing pattern with increasing age .
This is the first report on PCDDs/DFs contamination in human adipose tissue from Korea .
Organochlorine concentrations in human adipose tissues from western Kyungnam were generally much lower than those of other countries .
