Transportation of selenium from mother to fetus and its possible effects on mother's zinc , copper , cadmium , and mercury levels were studied together during the first trimester and at term in 216 mothers .
Mothers came from three geographical places with different selenium intakes .
The role of selenium as a biomarker for the vital function was estimated by studying the associations between tissue or blood selenium content and placental cytochrome P450 enzyme activities and the newborn's birth weight .
Regardless of the selenium intake of the mothers , higher concentrations were found in the cord blood than in mother's blood reflecting active transportation of selenium to the fetus .
Active smoking was associated with higher placental selenium concentrations like it is associated with higher placental zinc concentrations .
When the cadmium concentrations were high in placenta , as in smokers , the transfer of selenium from blood to placenta was increased , decreasing the selenium levels in blood .
On the other hand , the high selenium concentrations in blood were connected to lower cadmium concentrations in placenta also in nonsmokers .
Selenium had correlations with copper and zinc .
ECOD activity in placental tissue , mercury in mothers ' hair , mothers ' age , and selenium concentrations in cord blood and placental selenium all seem to have connections with xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes linked effects among mothers .
These data suggest that selenium has an active role in the mother's defense systems against the toxicity of environmental pollutants and the constituents of cigarette smoke .
