Detectable concentrations of the flame retardant hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) have been reported in human tissues worldwide , but investigations to determine fetal exposure to this brominated flame retardant are lacking .
This study was undertaken to determine the concentrations of \u03b1- , \u03b2- and \u03b3-HBCD in human tissues ( fetal liver and placenta ) from Canada .
Tissue samples were collected over a thirteen year period following elective pregnancy terminations in Montreal , Quebec , Canada .
Samples were extracted using homogenisation with solvent , cleaned up using adsorption chromatography and analysis was performed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry .
Total HBCD concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection ( <LOD ; <1 ng g(-1) ) to 4500 ng g(-1) lipid in fetal livers and <LOD ( <1 ng g(-1) ) to 5600 ng g(-1) lipid in placental tissue .
No clear temporal trend was established in liver samples , nor was a significant relationship observed between fetal age and \u03a3HBCD concentrations .
Temporal differences , however , were noted in placental tissues before and after 2005 .
HBCD concentrations in liver:placental paired tissue samples did not show a correlation .
HBCD was found in placental tissues from Canadian women and results indicate that HBCD was present , at measurable concentrations , in developing fetuses from as early as 6.5 weeks .
