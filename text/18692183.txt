Cadmium is a well-known nephrotoxic agent with extremely long biological half-time of 10-30 years in human .
To investigate the evolution of cadmium-induced renal effects in the population , a number of 148 residents who lived in cadmium-polluted area were followed-up for 3 years after the reduction of cadmium exposure in rice .
Urinary cadmium ( UCd ) , beta(2)-microglobulin ( B2M ) and albumin ( ALB ) were analyzed in 1995 and 1998 , respectively .
The results demonstrated that the changes of renal effects of residents depended on the levels of UCd before inflow of cadmium to human body declined .
In cases where UCd were less than 10 microg/g creatinine in 1995 , evidence was found indicating significant decreases in proteinuria ( i.e. , B2M and ALB ) 3 years later , whereas , in cases where the excretion of UCd exceeded 10 microg/g creatinine in 1995 , progression was observed .
The study of dose-response relationships between UCd and B2M or ALB also showed that the cadmium-induced renal dysfunction might be reversible if UCd concentration was low-level before exposure decreasing , otherwise it might be irreversible or aggravated .
