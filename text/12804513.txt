Ambient benzene measurements were conducted for the first time at four air monitoring sites in the Bangkok metropolitan region ( BMR ) , from January to December 2001 .
Analytical results show that the mean benzene concentrations range from 42.4 micro g/m(3) at the Din Daeng urban site to 15.1 micro g/m(3) at the Chaeng Wattana suburban site .
The monitoring results show that at a larger distance from the roadside or a higher level from the street surface , the level of benzene decreases .
Analysis of the ambient benzene concentrations was carried out with reference to meteorological influences and traffic density .
In traffic analysis , the combined effects of street topography and traffic flows established high impact on the overall benzene concentration in Bangkok .
Statistical analysis shows good correlations of blood benzene levels and trans , trans-muconic acid with ambient benzene and demonstrated substantial exposure from traffic .
