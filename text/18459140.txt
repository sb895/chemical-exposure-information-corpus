BACKGROUND We evaluated particulate matter in combined induced sputum ( IS ) and oxidation in exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) to test whether underlying inflammatory changes are present in asymptomatic welders .
METHODS Thirty welders from the Israel Defense Forces exposed to aluminum/iron ( Group 1 ) or to cadmium/chromium/iron/lead/nickel ( Group 2 , N = 16 ) and 27 non-exposed administrators were studied .
IS was recovered , particle size distribution , hydrogen peroxide and pH were measured , and exhaled breath condensate was collected .
RESULTS Group 2 had a higher % neutrophils than all other participants ( P = 0.0001 ) and a higher % particles >2 microm in diameter ( P = 0.0017 ) .
Percent particles and years of exposure highly correlated ( P = 0.051 ) .
All welders EBC samples had higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide than controls ( P = 0.0001). pH was lower only for Group 2 ( P = 0.0001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Combined IS and EBC measurements detect underlying inflammation in airways of asymptomatic welders .
It emerged that airway inflammation is present in asymptomatic welders , and that the particle burden , inflammatory cells , and level of oxidative stress are a function of the type and the duration of welding .
