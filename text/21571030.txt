The birth cohort BraMat ( n = 205 ; a sub-cohort of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study ( MoBa ) conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health ) was established to study whether prenatal exposure to toxicants from the maternal diet affects immunological health outcomes in children .
We here report on the environmental pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and dioxins , as well as acrylamide generated in food during heat treatment .
The frequency of common infections , eczema or itchiness , and periods of more than 10 days of dry cough , chest tightness or wheeze ( called wheeze ) in the children during the first year of life was assessed by questionnaire data ( n = 195 ) .
Prenatal dietary exposure to the toxicants was estimated using a validated food frequency questionnaire from MoBa .
Prenatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins was found to be associated with increased risk of wheeze and exanthema subitum , and also with increased frequency of upper respiratory tract infections .
We found no associations between prenatal exposure to acrylamide and the health outcomes investigated .
Our results suggest that prenatal dietary exposure to dioxins and PCBs may increase the risk of wheeze and infectious diseases during the first year of life .
