This study evaluated lead , arsenic , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) contamination in the residential communities adjacent to the Sydney , Nova Scotia , tar ponds , the area considered Canada's worst contaminated site .
The tar pond remediation policy has been limited to the site and some residential properties .
We compared background concentrations in 91 soil samples taken 5-20 km from the coke oven site with those in soil samples from the three communities surrounding the tar ponds : Whitney Pier , Ashby , and North End .
These surrounding communities were statistically different from background regarding arsenic , lead , and PAHs .
Twenty percent of the background soil samples and 95% of the tar pond soil samples were above the Canadian health-risk-based soil guidelines for arsenic ( 12 ppm ) , and 5% of the background samples and 80% of the tar pond soil samples were above the Canadian guidelines for lead ( 140 ppm ) .
Regarding dust lead and arsenic loading , the results provide no evidence that Whitney Pier is significantly different than Ashby and North End .
Children in these communities are predicted to have a 1-15% chance of blood lead > 10 microg/dL .
The results suggest that lead and arsenic found in the homes originate outside .
The lead content of paint in the homes was not evaluated , but consideration of painted wood at the doorway did not confound the results of the study .
The results indicate that the residential environment has been adversely affected by PAHs , lead , and arsenic and should be considered for remediation .
