Bisphenol A is a chemical that is present in a number of products and types of food packaging .
Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A may cause behavioural changes in young children .
The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to bisphenol A in pregnant Australian women as a surrogate of neonatal exposure .
First morning void urine samples were collected from 26 pregnant women at around week 38 of gestation .
Bisphenol A was detectable in 85% of the samples analysed .
The median concentration in this group of women was 2.41\u03bcg/L with a range of <LOD - 5.66\u03bcg/L .
Women experiencing their first pregnancy had slightly higher urinary bisphenol A concentrations , as did women with a pre-pregnancy BMI of <25 , however these relationships did not reach significance .
This study provides the first information on bisphenol A exposure in Australia and reveals that pregnant women have measured biological concentrations of urinary bisphenol A similar to those reported for pregnant women in other developed countries .
Given the potential impacts of prenatal bisphenol A exposure , further research in this area is warranted .
