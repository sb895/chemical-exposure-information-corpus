As part of a large European Union ( EU)-funded comparative toxicology and human epidemiology study , EU-Compare , a selection of organohalogen compounds ( OHCs ) was analyzed in maternal serum , collected at the 35th week of pregnancy , and in cord serum of a number of their infants to determine maternal concentrations and to investigate the extent of transplacental transfer of these compounds .
Eight neutral OHCs were analyzed : one polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB : CB-153),4,4'-DDE , five polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs : BDE-47 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-153 , and BDE-154 ) , and hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCDD ) .
Five phenolic OHCs were analyzed : three hydroxylated PCBs ( 40H-CB-107 , 40H-CB-146 , and 40H-CB-187 ) , one hydroxylated PBDE ( 60H-BDE-47 ) , and pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) .
All OHCs , except 60H-BDE-47 , were present in maternal and cord serum .
The historically identified OHCs showed the highest concentration : 4,4'-DDE ( median value 89 ng/g lipid in maternal serum and 68 ng/g lipid in cord serum ) and PCP ( median value 970 pg/g serum in maternal serum and 1500 pg/g serum in cord serum ) .
HBCDD and the PBDEs were present at much lower concentrations .
We conclude that OHCs are present in the serum of pregnant women , and all compounds tested are transferred over the placenta .
Because transfer is occurring at a critical stage of infant development , investigation of the health impact is urgent .
