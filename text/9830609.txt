Respiratory symptoms , lung function , and radiographic changes among 100 actively employed electricians in Edmonton , Alberta , Canada , with 20 or more years of union membership were compared with those of 100 telephone workers .
Posteroanterior chest radiographs were evaluated by two experienced chest physicians , with a third arbitrating films that were disagreed upon .
Employment in a number of industrial sectors was compared for time and for time-weighted exposure to dust and fumes .
Compared with telephone workers , electricians had more usual cough ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 3.36 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.36-8.31 ) , usual phlegm ( OR = 2.44 ; 95% CI , 1.01-5.86 ) , chronic phlegm ( OR = 2.74 ; 95% CI , 1.13-6.60 ) , and shortness of breath ( OR = 2.26 ; 95% CI , 1.10-4.67 ) , but no differences in lung function .
The prevalence of radiographic changes in both groups was low .
The electricians had more radiographic changes , but only for the category " any change " was the difference statistically significant ( OR = 5.2 ; 95% CI , 1.06-23.93 ) .
Only two electricians had small irregular opacities .
Phlegm , chronic phlegm , and chest tightness were significantly associated with cumulative exposure to fumes in the gas and oil industry and to total industrial construction .
