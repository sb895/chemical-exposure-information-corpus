OBJECTIVES Exposure to diisocyanates is a well known occupational hazard .
The objective of this study was to determine the possibility of an association between low exposure to toluene diisocyanate ( TDI ) ( airborne isocyanates and biomarkers of isocyanates in plasma and urine ) and symptoms of the eyes and upper and lower airways .
METHODS Altogether 136 workers occupationally exposed to TDI and 118 unexposed employees were studied .
A physician compiled thorough medical and occupational histories and registered symptoms , total and work-related , of the eyes , nose , and lower airways .
The exposure was assessed with personal air measurements and with biomarkers of exposure in plasma and urine .
The average exposure in the ambient air at the workplace of the exposed participants was below 1 ppb .
RESULTS Compared with the unexposed group , the exposed workers reported more total symptoms of the eyes and lower airways , as well as nose bleeding .
A similar pattern , with even higher odds ratios , was observed for work-related symptoms .
However , only eye symptoms proved to be significantly associated with the exposure , notably with all of the exposure measures .
The risk was more pronounced for exposure to 2,4-TDI than for exposure to 2,6-TDI .
CONCLUSIONS Even very low exposure to TDI is related to negative health effects on exposed workers .
Clear dose-response relationships were observed between three different measures of exposure and symptoms of the eyes .
