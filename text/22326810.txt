Arsenic in drinking water presents a serious public health problem in Serbia , but its relationship with diabetes has not been studied previously .
The aim of this study was to explore the association between exposure to arsenic in drinking water and the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in Middle Banat region , Serbia .
This cross-sectional study comprised two populations .
Exposed population in Middle Banat region consumes drinking water with arsenic ( mean = 56 \u03bcg/L ) ; unexposed population from six regions in Central Serbia consumes arsenic below detection limit ( 2 \u03bcg/L ) .
Newly diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes were obtained from the National Registry of Diabetes in 2008 .
The Registry included age , gender , family history of diabetes , presence of overweight , central obesity , cholesterol and triglyceride levels .
In addition , the number of cases of diabetes reported in years 2006 , 2007 and 2009 was used to calculate standardized incidence rates for both populations .
Two populations were comparable by age , family history of diabetes and prevalence of overweight persons .
Unexposed population was more likely to have central obesity , and high total cholesterol and triglycerides .
Standardized incidence rates of type 2 diabetes were higher in exposed population .
Odds ratios for type 2 diabetes were significantly higher for the exposed population , both men and women , in the period from 2006 to 2009 , when compared with the unexposed population .
The population from Middle Banat region , consuming drinking water with low levels of arsenic , was at higher risk for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in comparison to the unexposed population in Central Serbia .
