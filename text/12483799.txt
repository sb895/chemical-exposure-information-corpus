The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate mercury exposure and health status among Munduruku Indians from the community of Sai Cinza , State of Par√° , Brazil .
The population studied included 330 indians , who submitted to a questionnaire , clinical exams , and collection of hair , blood , urine , and feces .
Mercury was measured in hair and fish .
Although no person was found to have overt mercury intoxication , the mean levels of mercury in hair were elevated ( 14.45 micrograms/g for children from 7 to 12 years old , 15.70 micrograms/g for women between 14 and 44 years old , and 14.1 micrograms/g for the remaining population ) .
Mercury levels in fish were below levels recommended by the World Health Organization , but rates of fish consumption were high .
These results place this indigenous populations as a group under risk of mercury toxicity from the gold production .
