The Near-Road Exposures and Effects of Urban Air Pollutants Study ( NEXUS ) was designed to examine the relationship between near-roadway exposures to air pollutants and respiratory outcomes in a cohort of asthmatic children who live close to major roadways in Detroit , Michigan USA .
From September 2010 to December 2012 a total of 139 children with asthma , ages 6-14 , were enrolled in the study on the basis of the proximity of their home to major roadways that carried different amounts of diesel traffic .
The goal of the study was to investigate the effects of traffic-associated exposures on adverse respiratory outcomes , biomolecular markers of inflammatory and oxidative stress , and how these exposures affect the frequency and severity of respiratory viral infections in a cohort of children with asthma .
An integrated measurement and modeling approach was used to quantitatively estimate the contribution of traffic sources to near-roadway air pollution and evaluate predictive models for assessing the impact of near-roadway pollution on children's exposures .
Two intensive field campaigns were conducted in Fall 2010 and Spring 2011 to measure a suite of air pollutants including PM2.5 mass and composition , oxides of nitrogen ( NO and NO2 ) , carbon monoxide , and black carbon indoors and outdoors of 25 participants ' homes , at two area schools , and along a spatial transect adjacent to I-96 , a major highway in Detroit .
These data were used to evaluate and refine models to estimate air quality and exposures for each child on a daily basis for the health analyses .
The study design and methods are described , and selected measurement results from the Fall 2010 field intensive are presented to illustrate the design and successful implementation of the study .
These data provide evidence of roadway impacts and exposure variability between study participants that will be further explored for associations with the health measures .
