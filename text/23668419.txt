Cereal grains are the dominant source of cadmium in the human diet , with rice being to the fore .
Here we explore the effect of geographic , genetic , and processing ( milling ) factors on rice grain cadmium and rice consumption rates that lead to dietary variance in cadmium intake .
From a survey of 12 countries on four continents , cadmium levels in rice grain were the highest in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka , with both these countries also having high per capita rice intakes .
For Bangladesh and Sri Lanka , there was high weekly intake of cadmium from rice , leading to intakes deemed unsafe by international and national regulators .
While genetic variance , and to a lesser extent milling , provide strategies for reducing cadmium in rice , caution has to be used , as there is environmental regulation as well as genetic regulation of cadmium accumulation within rice grains .
For countries that import rice , grain cadmium can be controlled by where that rice is sourced , but for countries with subsistence rice economies that have high levels of cadmium in rice grain , agronomic and breeding strategies are required to lower grain cadmium .
