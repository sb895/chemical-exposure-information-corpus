INTRODUCTION Prenatal exposure to some pesticides can adversely affect male reproductive health in animals .
We investigated a possible human association between maternal exposure to 27 organochlorine compounds used as pesticides and cryptorchidism among male children .
DESIGN Within a prospective birth cohort , we performed a case-control study ; 62 milk samples from mothers of cryptorchid boys and 68 from mothers of healthy boys were selected .
Milk was collected as individual pools between 1 and 3 months postpartum and analyzed for 27 organochlorine pesticides .
RESULTS Eight organochlorine pesticides were measurable in all samples ( medians ; nanograms per gram lipid ) for cases/controls : 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene ( p,p -DDE ) : 97.3/83.8 ; beta-hexachlorocyclohexane ( beta-HCH ) : 13.6/12.3 ; hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) : 10.6/8.8 ; alpha-endosulfan : 7.0/6.7 ; oxychlordane : 4.5/4.1 ; 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane ( p,p -DDT ) : 4.6/4.0 ; dieldrin : 4.1/3.1 ; cis-heptachloroepoxide ( cis-HE ) : 2.5/2.2 .
Five compounds [ octachlorostyrene ( OCS ) ; pentachlorobenzene , 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane(p,p -DDD ) ; o,p -DDT ; mirex ] were measurable in most samples ( detection rates 90.8-99.2% ) but in lower concentrations .
For methoxychlor , cis-chlordane , pentachloroanisole ( PCA ) , gamma-HCH , 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-chlorophenyl) -2,2(4-chlorophenyl) ethane , trans-chlordane , alpha-HCH , and o,p -DDE , both concentrations and detection rates were low ( 26.5-71.5% ) .
Heptachlor , HCH ( lc delta , epsilon ) , aldrin , beta-endosulfan and trans-heptachloroepoxide were detected at negligible concentrations and low detection rates and were not analyzed further .
Seventeen of 21 organochlorine pesticides [ p,p -DDT , p,p-DDE , p,p-DDD , o,p-DDT , HCH ( alpha , beta , gamma ) , HCB , PCA , alpha-endosulfan , cis-HE , chlordane ( cis- , trans- ) oxychlordane , methoxychlor , OCS , and dieldrin ] were measured in higher median concentrations in case milk than in control milk .
Apart from trans-chlordane ( p = 0.012 ) , there were no significant differences between cryptorchid and healthy boys for individual chemicals .
However , combined statistical analysis of the eight most abundant persistent pesticides showed that pesticide levels in breast milk were significantly higher in boys with cryptorchidism ( p = 0.032 ) .
CONCLUSION The association between congenital cryptorchidism and some persistent pesticides in breast milk as a proxy for maternal exposure suggests that testicular descent in the fetus may be adversely affected .
