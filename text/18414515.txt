Investigations into human exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA ) have , for the most part , assessed intake based on food consumption estimates combined with measurements or estimates of BPA in foods .
In this study , nationally representative data on urinary levels of BPA in the United States ( US ) from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) were used to estimate daily intake of BPA , assuming steady-state excretion .
Distributions of intakes for the US population were determined for ( i ) all NHANES participants with urinary BPA data ; ( ii ) participants by the following age groups : 6-11 years , 12-19 years , 20-39 years , 40-59 years , and 60+ years ; and ( iii ) participants by gender .
On the basis of the NHANES urinary BPA data and the assumptions described in this paper , daily BPA intakes for male participants are statistically significantly higher than for female participants , and there are statistically significant differences in daily BPA intakes according to age groups , with the oldest group having the lowest estimated intakes .
Median intake was approximately three orders of magnitude below health-based guidance values of 50 microg/kg-day .
