BACKGROUND Region II of Chile ( the second most northerly administrative region ) experienced dramatic increases in average arsenic water concentrations beginning in 1958 , followed by marked declines in the 1970s when water treatment plants were installed .
This history provides a unique opportunity to study time trends in the development of arsenic-related cancers , including lung and bladder cancers .
METHODS We investigated lung and bladder cancer mortality from 1950 to 2000 for region II compared with region V , where drinking water was not contaminated with arsenic .
Mortality data were obtained from 218,174 death certificates for the two regions for 1950-1970 and from mortality data tapes that identified 307,541 deaths in the two regions for 1971-2000 .
Poisson regression models were used to identify time trends in rate ratios ( RRs ) of mortality from lung and bladder cancers comparing region II with region V. RESULTS Lung and bladder cancer mortality rate ratios for region II compared with region V started to increase about 10 years after high arsenic exposures commenced and continued to rise until peaking in 1986-1997 .
The peak lung cancer mortality RRs were 3.61 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 3.13 to 4.16 ) for men and 3.26 ( 95% CI = 2.50 to 4.23 ) for women .
The peak bladder cancer RRs were 6.10 ( 95% CI = 3.97 to 9.39 ) for men and 13.8 ( 95% CI = 7.74 to 24.5 ) for women .
Combined lung and bladder cancer mortality rates in region II were highest in the period 1992-1994 , with mortality rates of 153 and 50 per 100,000 men and women , respectively , in region II compared with 54 and 19 per 100,000 in region V. CONCLUSIONS Such large increases in total population cancer mortality rates have , to our knowledge , not been documented for any other environmental exposure .
The long latency pattern is noteworthy , with mortality from lung and bladder cancers continuing to be high until the late 1990s , even though major decreases in arsenic exposure occurred more than 25 years earlier .
