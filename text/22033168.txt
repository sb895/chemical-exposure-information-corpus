Food-borne cadmium was the principal source of exposure for persons living in the 12 cadmium-contaminated villages in Mae Sot District , Tak Province , northwestern Thailand .
This report presents progress in cadmium-related health effects among persons with high cadmium exposure .
The study included 436 persons who had urinary cadmium levels \u22655 \u03bcg/g creatinine and were screened for urinary cadmium , renal function , hypertension , diabetes and urinary stones in 2005 ( baseline ) and 2010 ( 5-year follow-up ) .
Study renal biomarkers included urinary excretion of \u03b2(2)-microglobulin ( \u03b2(2)-MG ) , total protein and calcium , serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) .
The geometric mean level of urinary cadmium statistically significantly reduced from 9.5±1.6 \u03bcg/g creatinine in 2005 to 8.8±1.6 \u03bcg/g creatinine in 2010 .
Compared to baseline , the follow-up examination revealed significant increases in urinary \u03b2(2)-MG ( tubular effect ) , urinary total protein and serum creatinine , and a decrease in GFR ( glomerular effects ) .
Progressive renal dysfunctions were similarly observed in persons both with and without reduction in cadmium intake .
Significant increases in prevalence of hypertension , diabetes and urinary stones were also detected at follow-up .
These three disorders were found to markedly impair renal functions in the study persons .
Our study indicates that in persons with prolonged excessive cadmium exposure , toxic health effects may progress even after exposure reduction .
Renal damage from cadmium can be due to its direct nephrotoxic effect and also through the related disorders causing nephropathy .
