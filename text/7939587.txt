Absorption and excretion of cobalt in the hard metal industry was investigated by means of ambient air and urine measurements in three factories with high levels of environmental cobalt pollution .
In the presence of poor hygiene conditions and permission to smoking during work , there was no relationship between cobalt ambient air and cobalt urine concentrations .
Such a finding was therefore attributed to a substantial skin contact .
A simple experiment of skin exposure to freshly mixed or waste powder on volunteers identified a ten-fold increase of cobalt in urine in the post-exposure samples , thus confirming the contribution of dermal exposure as a route of entry .
An improvement in the hygiene of the working conditions helped to investigate the relationship between exposure and excretion level .
Cobalt uptake through the different routes of entry may be substantial , and requires a more prolonged exposure-free period so that the excretion rate can be reduced to the reference population level .
