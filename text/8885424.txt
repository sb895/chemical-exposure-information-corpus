Monitoring of environmental and human exposure to mercury in the Nungwe Bay area of the Lake Victoria goldfields , Tanzania , has revealed low mercury concentrations in fish ( range : 1.8-16.9 ppb , mean : 7.0 ppb ) and human hair ( range : 156-5433 ppb , mean : 947 ppb ) that represent background levels .
Gold mining has not produced a significant increase in environmental methylmercury that is available for bioaccummulation in aquatic food chains .
Urinary mercury levels in gold mine workers frequently exposed to Hg vapour in amalgamation and burning of amalgam were significantly higher ( mean : 241 ng/ml ) than those in the general mine population not occupational exposed to Hg ( mean : 2.6 ng/ml ) .
Rotation of mine duties reduced Hg exposure levels and hence the risk of intoxication in the gold mine workers .
The lowest urinary and hair mercury levels were found in the Nungwe Bay fishing village population .
This was consistent with the low mercury content of fish consumed by the inhabitants of the Nungwe Bay .
