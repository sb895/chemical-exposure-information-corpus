This study investigated the contamination status of PCBs , PBDEs and HBCDs in human and possible exposure pathways in three Vietnamese e-waste recycling sites : Trang Minh ( suburb of Hai Phong city ) , Dong Mai and Bui Dau ( Hung Yen province ) , and one reference site ( capital city Hanoi ) by analysing human breast milk samples and examining the relationships between contaminant levels and lifestyle factors .
Levels of PBDEs , but not PCBs and HBCDs , were significantly higher in Trang Minh and Bui Dau than in the reference site .
The recyclers from Bui Dau had the highest levels of PBDEs ( 20-250 ng g(-1) lipid wt. ) , higher than in the reference group by two orders of magnitude and more abundant than PCBs ( 28-59 ng g(-1) lipid wt. ) , and were also the only group with significant exposure to HBCDs ( 1.4-7.6 ng g(-1) lipid wt. ) .
A specific accumulation , unrelated to diet , of low-chlorinated PCBs and high-brominated PBDEs was observed in e-waste recyclers , suggesting extensive exposure to these compounds during e-waste recycling activities , possibly through inhalation and ingestion of dust .
The estimated infant intake dose of PBDEs from breast milk of some mothers occupationally involved in e-waste recycling were close to or higher than the reference doses issued by the U.S. EPA .
