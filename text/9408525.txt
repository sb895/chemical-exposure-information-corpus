Lung function changes and respiratory symptoms were investigated in a cross-sectional study in rubber workers exposed to dust and fumes .
To exclude acute pulmonary effects related to " rubber fumes, " lung function was measured in curing workers at the start and end of the day shift .
Exposure to inhalable dust was measured in all production areas .
The results were compared with a reference population from the same geographical region .
This study indicates that exposure to " rubber fumes " in curing workers was not related to cross-shift and cross-week decreases in pulmonary function at levels approximately 1 mg/m3 ( AM ) inhalable dust and 260 micrograms/m3 cyclohexane soluble fraction ( CSF ) .
Cross-sectional analyses gave indications for a small loss in pulmonary function in all rubber workers .
This decrease in lung function was associated with 10 years of exposure to an average of 2.0 mg/m3 inhalable dust .
Our study showed a mean annual decline of 0.08% for the FEV1/FVC ratio and of 10 ml/s for the MMEF .
Self-reported chronic respiratory symptoms were not related to dust exposure .
