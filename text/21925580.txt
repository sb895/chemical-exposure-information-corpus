Traditional gold mining , using metallic mercury ( Hg(0) ) to form gold amalgam , followed by burning to remove the Hg(0) , is widely used in South America , Africa and Asia .
The gold is sold to merchants who burn it again to eliminate remaining Hg(0) .
In Ecuador , 200 gold miners , 37 gold merchants and 72 referents were studied .
The median Hg concentrations in urine ( U-Hg ) were 3.3 ( range 0.23-170 ) , 37 ( 3.2-420 ) , and 1.6 ( 0.2-13)\u03bcg/g creatinine , respectively , and in whole blood ( B-Hg ) were 5.2 , 30 , and 5.0 \u03bcg/L , respectively .
Biomarker concentrations among merchants were statistically significantly higher than among miners and referents ; also the miners differed from the referents .
Burning of gold amalgam among miners was intermittent ; U-Hg decreased in the burning-free period .
In computerized neuromotor examinations , B-Hg and U-Hg concentrations were associated with increases in the centre frequency of the tremor , as well as in reaction time and postural stability.Retention of Hg ( B-Hg ) , and the elimination rate ( U-Hg ) appears to be modified by polymorphism in a gene of an enzyme in the glutathione synthesis ( GCLM ) , but there were no significant genetic modifications for the associations between exposure and neurotoxicity.Thus , the gold merchants have a much higher exposure and risk than the miners , in whom the exposure varies over time .
The metabolism of Hg is modified by genetic traits .
The present exposure to Hg had limited neurotoxic effects .
