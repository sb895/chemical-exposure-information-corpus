This paper presents the first study of pesticide residue results in grain from Kazakhstan .
A total of 80 samples : barley , oat , rye , and wheat were collected and tested in the accredited laboratory .
Among 180 pesticides , 10 active substances were detected .
Banned pesticides , such as DDTs , \u03b3-HCH , aldrin and diazinon were found in cereal grain .
Chlorpyrifos methyl and pirimiphos methyl were the most frequently detected residues .
No residues were found in 77.5% of the samples , 13.75% contained pesticide residues at or below MRLs , and 8.75% above MRLs .
The greatest percentage of samples with residues ( 29% ) was noted for wheat , and the lowest for rye ( 20% ) .
Obtained data were used to estimate potential health risks associated with exposure to these pesticides .
The highest estimated daily intakes ( EDIs ) were as follows : 789% of the ADI for aldrin ( wheat ) and 49.8% of the ADI for pirimiphos methyl ( wheat and rye ) .
The acute risk from aldrin and tebuconazole in wheat was 315.9% and 98.7% ARfD , respectively .
The results show that despite the highest EDIs of pesticide residues in cereals , the current situation could not be considered a serious public health problem .
Nevertheless , an investigation into continuous monitoring of pesticide residues in grain is recommended .
