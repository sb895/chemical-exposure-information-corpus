The time trends of exposure to heavy metals are not adequately known .
This is a worldwide problem with regard to the basis for preventive actions and evaluation of their effects .
This study addresses time trends for the three toxic elements cadmium ( Cd ) , mercury ( Hg ) , and lead ( Pb ) .
Concentrations in erythrocytes ( Ery ) were determined in a subsample of the population-based MONICA surveys from 1990 , 1994 , and 1999 in a total of 600 men and women aged 25-74 years .
The study took place in the two northernmost counties in Sweden .
To assess the effect of changes in the environment , adjustments were made for life-style factors that are determinants of exposure .
Annual decreases of 5-6% were seen for Ery-Pb levels ( adjusted for age and changes in alcohol intake ) and Ery-Hg levels ( adjusted for age and changes in fish intake ) .
Ery-Cd levels ( adjusted for age ) showed a similar significant decrease in smoking men .
It is concluded that for Pb and maybe also Hg the actions against pollution during recent decades have caused a rapid decrease of exposure ; for Hg the decreased use of dental amalgam may also have had an influence .
For Cd , the decline in Ery-Cd was seen only in smokers , indicating that Cd exposure from tobacco has decreased , while other environmental sources of Cd have not changed significantly .
To further improve the health status in Sweden , it is important to decrease the pollution of Cd , and actions against smoking in the community are important .
