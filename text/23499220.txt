To assess the daily intakes of total mercury ( THg ) and methylmercury ( MeHg ) and the possible adverse health impacts , different food groups including fish , meat , vegetable and rice were collected from three areas in Cambodia .
The concentrations of THg and MeHg ranged from 0.16 to 171 ng g(-1) and not detected ( ND ) to 82.3 ng g(-1) wet weight ( ww ) , respectively .
The concentrations of THg and MeHg in fish were approximately three to four orders of magnitude greater than that in fruit and vegetable .
Fish had the highest contribution to the total daily intakes of THg and MeHg .
The estimated daily intake ( EDI ) of THg for the general population in Kampong Cham , Kratie and Kandal was 0.24 , 1.38 and 0.22 \u03bcg kg(-1) bw d(-1) , and 0.11 , 0.45 and 0.06 \u03bcg kg(-1) bw d(-1) for MeHg , respectively .
The dietary daily intakes of MeHg in Kratie and Kampong Cham were greater than the reference dose ( RfD ) imposed by The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( USEPA ) and in Kratie was also exceed the provisional tolerable weekly intake ( PTWI ) imposed by World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
To our knowledge , this the first study to evaluate the daily intakes of THg and MeHg in Cambodia .
