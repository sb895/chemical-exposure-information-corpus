Reference values for four arsenic species ( inorganic As(III) ; inorganic As(V) ; dimethylarsinic acid DMA ; monomethylarsonic acid MMA ) in urine were evaluated for 101 male persons in northern Germany ( 46.9 +/- 10.5 y ) applying anion exchange chromatographic species separation with on-line hydride-technique atomic absorption spectrometry ( between-days imprecision 6.8-10.1% ; 11.0-50.0 micrograms/l ; n = 30 ; detection limits d. l. 1 ; 10 ; 2 ; 2 micrograms/l ) .
DMA was found in 88.1% of the persons ( x +/- s = 7.21 +/- 9.64 micrograms/g creatinine ; median 4.02 micrograms/g ; 95% < 22.5 micrograms/g ) followed by As(III) ( 11.3% ; median < d. l. ; 95% < 0.54 microgram/g ) whereas no MMA and As(V) could be found .
Seafood consumption within the last 2 days led to higher DMA levels compared to having seafood more than 6 days ago ( n = 43 vs. n = 42 ; 10.04 +/- 11.58 vs. 3.47 +/- 3.55 micrograms/g ; p < 0.01 ) .
