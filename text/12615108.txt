A method for trace analysis of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDE ) in fish based on gas chromatography/electron ionization high resolution mass spectrometry ( GC/EI-HRMS ) was developed , and levels of PBDE were determined in whitefish ( Coregonus sp. ) from eight Swiss lakes and in rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) from four Swiss fish farms .
PBDE concentrations ( sum of PBDE congeners BDE-28 , BDE-47 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-153 , BDE-154 , and BDE-183 ) in filet from whitefish between 36 and 165 ng/g lipid weight ( lw ) were found , corresponding to wet weight ( ww ) concentrations of 1.6-7.4 ng/gww .
PBDE contents in filet from farmed rainbow trout were significantly lower than in wild whitefish ( 12-24 ng/glw , 0.74-1.3 ng/gww ) , and the PBDE congener patterns were different for both species ( a higher BDE-47 to BDE-99 ratio for farmed rainbow trout compared to wild whitefish was found ) .
Whitefish PBDE levels [ ng/glw ] correlate better with the surface/volume ratio of the respective lakes ( r(2)=0.70 ) than with other lake properties such as catchment area ( size or number of inhabitants ) or residence time , suggesting atmospheric deposition as an input pathway for PBDE .
Based on an average daily consumption of 20 g whitefish ( Switzerland ) with a PBDE content of 7.4 ng/gww ( highest PBDE concentration detected in this study ) , a maximum daily intake of 0.15 microg PBDE was estimated ( 0.026 microg/day for farmed trout ) .
This number corresponds to the lower end of the estimate for the total PBDE intake of the Nordic consumer of 0.2-0.7 microg/day .
