One possible mechanism of lowering of the birth weight by tobacco smoke is disturbance in zinc transfer trough placenta caused by accumulation of cadmium in placenta .
The aim of the study was determination of cadmium and zinc in placenta of smoking women and correlation its with cotinine concentration and birth weight The study shown that concentration of cotinine in urine of smoking woman was 859+/-1234 ng/mg creatinine .
Cadmium and zinc concentrations in smokers were higher ( Cd 0.095+/-0.041 microg/g ; Zn 46.7+/-8.3307 microg ! g ) than in non smokers ( Cd 0.067 +/-0.022 microg/g ; Zn 41.0+/-5.54 microg/g ) .
Concentration of cadmium in placenta shown week correlation with concentration of cotinine in urine .
The birth weight of newborn of smoking women ( 2935.7+/-836.83 g ) was statistically lower than non smokers ( 3288.9 +/-744.47 g ) , however it was not correlated with placenta cadmium and zinc concentration .
The high variability of the ratio of zinc to cadmium concentration caused that was not statistical differences between studied groups .
The performed research shown the influence of cigarette smoking of birth weight and cadmium concentration in placenta , however did not proved the hypotheses that accumulation of cadmium and zinc in placenta influence on birth weight .
