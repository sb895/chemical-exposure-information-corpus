Trail , Canada , has been the site of an active lead/zinc smelter for nearly a century .
Since 1991 , the Trail Community Lead Task Force has carried out blood lead screening , case management , education programs targeted at early childhood groups and the general community , community dust abatement , exposure pathways studies , and remedial trials .
From 1989 through 1996 , average blood lead levels of children tested for the first time declined at an average rate of 0.6 microg/dl/year , while blood lead levels in Canadian children not living near point sources appeared to be leveling off following the phase-out of leaded gasoline .
Since there was no concurrent improvement in local environmental conditions during this time , it is possible that the continuing decline in Trail blood lead levels has been at least partly due to community-wide intervention programs .
One year follow-up of children whose families received in-home educational visits , as well as assistance with home-based dust control measures , found that these specific interventions produced average blood lead changes of +0.5- -4.0 microg/dl , with statistically significant declines in 3 years out of 5 .
Education and dust control , particularly actions targeted toward higher risk children , appear to have served as effective and appropriate interim remedial measures while major source control measures have been implemented at the smelter site .
