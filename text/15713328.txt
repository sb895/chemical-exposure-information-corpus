To better understand the magnitude of arsenic contamination in groundwater and its effects on human beings , a detailed study was carried out in Jalangi , one of the 85 arsenic affected blocks in West Bengal , India .
Jalangi block is approximately 122 km2 in size and has a population of 215538 .
Of the 1916 water samples analyzed ( about 31% of the total hand tubewells ) from the Jalangi block , 77.8% were found to have arsenic above 10 microg l(-1) [ the World Health Organization ( WHO)-recommended level of arsenic in drinking water ] , 51% had arsenic above 50 microg l(-1) ( the Indian standard of permissible limit of arsenic in drinking water ) and 17% had arsenic at above 300 microg l(-1) ( the concentration predicting overt arsenical skin lesions ) .
From our preliminary medical screening , 1488 of the 7221 people examined in the 44 villages of Jalangi block exhibit definite arsenical skin lesions .
An estimation of probable population that may suffer from arsenical skin lesions and cancer in the Jalangi block has been evaluated comparing along with international data .
A total of 1600 biologic samples including hair , nail and urine have been analyzed from the affected villages of Jalangi block and on an average 88% of the biologic samples contain arsenic above the normal level .
Thus , a vast population of the block may have arsenic body burden .
Cases of Bowen's disease and cancer have been identified among adults who also show arsenical skin lesions and children in this block are also seriously affected .
Obstetric examinations were also carried out in this block .
