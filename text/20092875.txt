First , we determined the levels of 8 trace elements ( As , Se , Hg , Cd , Ag , Mn , Cr and Pb ) in 530 village drinking water sources by graphite furnace or flame atomic absorption spectroscopy method , in Kurdistan Province in the west of Iran .
The results showed that the level of As , Cd and Se in 28 village drinking water sources exceeded WHO or National Standard limits .
The levels of concentration of arsenic in drinking water ranged from 42 to 1500microg/L .
Then in a cross-sectional survey , 587 people from 211 households were chosen for clinical examinations of multi-chronic arsenical poisoning including pigment disorders , keratosis of palms and soles , Mee's line in fingers and nails and the gangrene as a systemic manifestation .
Of 587 participants , 180 ( 30.7% ) participants were affected by representing the type of chronic arsenical poisoning .
The prevalence of Mee's line , keratosis , and pigment disorders were 86.1% , 77.2% and 67.8% respectively .
Therefore , the prevalence of Mee's line between inhabitants was higher than the other disorders .
The results show a strong linear relationship between arsenic exposure and occurrence of multi-chronic arsenical poisoning ( R(2)=0.76 ) .
The association between age for more than 40 years and gender for more than 60 years with chronic arsenical poisoning is significant ( p<0.05 ) .
Also , there is a relationship between subjects who were affected with disorders and duration of living in the village .
Except for gangrene disorder , the odds ratio of prevalence of other disorders with arsenic exposure level in drinking water show a highly significant relationship between arsenic content and the risk of chronic disorders ( p<0.01 ) .
These results confirm the need to further study trace elements in drinking waters , food products and other samples in this area and the relationship to other chronic diseases arising out of arsenicosis .
