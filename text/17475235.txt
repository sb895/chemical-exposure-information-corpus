Inorganic arsenic exposure in drinking water has been recently related to diabetes mellitus .
To evaluate this relationship the authors conducted in 2003 , a case-control study in an arseniasis-endemic region from Coahuila , a northern state of Mexico with a high incidence of diabetes .
The present analysis includes 200 cases and 200 controls .
Cases were obtained from a previous cross-sectional study conducted in that region .
Diagnosis of diabetes was established following the American Diabetes Association criteria , with two fasting glucose values > or = 126 mg/100 ml ( > or = 7.0 mmol/l ) or a history of diabetes treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents .
The next subject studied , subsequent to the identification of a case in the cross-sectional study was taken as control .
Inorganic arsenic exposure was measured through total arsenic concentrations in urine , measured by hydride-generation atomic absorption spectrophotometry .
Subjects with intermediate total arsenic concentration in urine ( 63.5-104 microg/g creatinine ) had two-fold higher risk of having diabetes ( odds ratio=2.16 ; 95% confidence interval : 1.23 , 3.79 ) , but the risk was almost three times greater in subjects with higher concentrations of total arsenic in urine ( odds ratio=2.84 ; 95% confidence interval : 1.64 , 4.92 ) .
This data provides additional evidence that inorganic arsenic exposure may be diabetogenic .
