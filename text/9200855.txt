Thirty-six workers exposed to low or moderate levels of lead at low temperature refining processes were surveyed to examine the route of lead intake .
Blood lead level ( BPb ) , delta-aminolevulinic acid in urine , lead in facial skin wipes ( Face-Pb ) and lead in fingernails ( Nail-Pb ) were measured and their personal hygienic behavior was surveyed by a questionnaire .
BPb showed a significant correlation with Face-Pb and Nail-Pb ( r = 0.730 and r = 0.590 , respectively ) .
Multiple regression analysis extracted the factors of smoking at the workplace , face-Pb and nail-Pb as significantly related to BPb level .
Electron-microscopic observation revealed that the majority of dust particles collected from worker's faces were larger than respirable size .
Lead ingestion from contaminated face skin and fingers may contribute to elevations in the BPb level among workers .
