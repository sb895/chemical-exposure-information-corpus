We measured the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls ( non-ortho PCBs ) , and mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls ( mono-ortho PCBs ) in paired samples of blood and breast milk collected from 60 mothers in Sapporo City , Hokkaido Prefecture , Japan .
The present study is one of the few studies in which PCDDs , PCDFs , and dioxin-like PCBs have been measured in blood and breast milk collected from 60 same mothers .
Of these 60 mothers , 30 were primipara ( mean : 30.1 years , median : 28.0 years ) and 30 were multipara ( mean : 32.2 years , median : 32.5 years ) .
The arithmetic mean TEQ concentrations of PCDDs , PCDFs , non-ortho PCBs , and mono-ortho PCBs in blood and breast milk of the primiparous mothers were 9.0 , 3.3 , 5.7 , and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid , respectively , and 5.2 , 2.2 , 4.5 , and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid , respectively , with the total TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds being 9.3-42.9 ( mean : 18.4 , median : 17.3 ) and 7.0-41.1 ( mean : 12.3 , median : 11.4 ) pg TEQ g(-1) lipid , respectively .
In the case of multiparous mothers , the arithmetic mean TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds in blood and breast milk were 7.1 , 2.7 , 5.3 , and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid , respectively , and 3.9 , 1.7 , 3.8 , and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid , respectively , with the total TEQ concentrations being 3.4-28.1 ( mean : 15.5 , median : 13.9 ) and 2.7-20.0 ( mean : 9.8 , median : 9.2)pg TEQ g(-1) lipid , respectively .
The total TEQ concentrations of PCDDs , PCDFs , non-ortho PCBs , and mono-ortho PCBs in blood and breast milk of primiparous mothers in Sapporo City appeared to be generally lower than those recently surveyed throughout the greater area of Japan .
Significant correlations were observed between age and the total TEQ concentrations of PCDDs , PCDFs , non-ortho PCBs , and mono-ortho PCBs in the blood of primiparae and multiparae , and significant correlations were also observed between age and the total TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds in the breast milk of primiparae and multiparae .
The total TEQ concentrations of PCDDs , PCDFs , and dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of primiparous mothers showed a close correlation to those in their breast milk and also showed good correlations between the total TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds in the blood of multiparous mothers and those in their breast milk .
The result of a comparison of the arithmetic mean concentrations of each congener of PCDDs , PCDFs , non-ortho PCBs , and mono-ortho PCBs in blood and breast milk indicated that the transfer of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( OCDD ) from the blood to the breast milk was lower than those of other congeners .
In contrast , among mono-ortho PCBs congeners , the arithmetic mean concentrations of 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl ( PentaCB ) ( #118 ) and 2,3,3',4,4'-PentaCB ( #105 ) in the breast milk were slightly higher than those in the blood , which suggested that breast-fed infants may be at higher risk from mono-ortho PCBs .
