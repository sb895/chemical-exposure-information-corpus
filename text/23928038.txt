Persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , and organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) are of global concern because of their widespread contamination and adverse health effects .
Potential endocrine disruption , especially of thyroid status by PCBs has been repeatedly suggested in both experimental and epidemiological studies .
However the associations with PBDEs or OCPs have been arguable especially in human populations .
We investigated the associations between major groups of POPs and thyroid hormone balances among pregnant women .
One hundred five pregnant women at delivery were recruited from four cities of Korea in 2011 and were investigated .
Blood samples were collected within a day before delivery .
Serum was then analyzed for 19 PCBs , 19 PBDEs , and 19 OCPs , along with five thyroid hormones ( free and total T3 and T4 , and TSH ) .
Several PCBs such as PCB28 , 52 , and 118 showed negative associations with T3 or T4 .
BDE47 and total PBDEs showed significant associations with T3 or T4 .
For OCPs , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes ( DDTs ) and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) were generally associated with reduction of T3 or T4 .
The thyroid hormone levels of all subjects were within the reference range , however exposure to several target POPs were clearly related with potential for disrupting thyroid hormone balance among pregnant women , at the current level of exposure .
Although subtle , the changes in thyroid hormones should be seen with caution because even minor changes within pregnant women may have significant consequences especially on sensitive population like fetus .
