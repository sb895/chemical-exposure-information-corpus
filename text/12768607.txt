BACKGROUND Prevalence of exposure related respiratory symptoms and decreases in lung function are unknown among quartz dust exposed construction workers .
METHODS In a cross-sectional study ( n = 1335 ) , the occurrence of respiratory symptoms , was recorded and spirometric lung function was measured .
Results were associated with exposure data and presence of radiographic abnormalities and compared with a reference population .
RESULTS Pneumoconiosis ( profusion category 1/1 or greater ) was associated with increased risks of FEV(1) and FVC values in the lowest 5% group , and with group-based decreases of 270 ml/s and 180 ml , respectively .
Average lung function of construction workers was somewhat lower compared to a Dutch reference population .
Lung function was not associated with exposure , except for a reduction in FVC of 5 ml per year for those with higher exposure .
CONCLUSIONS In quartz dust exposed construction workers obstructive and restrictive lung function loss was detected .
