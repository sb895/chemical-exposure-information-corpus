Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were determined in serum samples from residents of a Korean urban area ( Seoul ) .
This study was performed on 40 Koreans in the general population , aged 27-58 , who had resided in urban areas for more than 10 years without occupational exposure to organochlorine pollutants .
To our knowledge , this study was the first report on serum concentrations of OCPs in Korean residents. p,p'-DDE , beta-HCH , p,p'-DDT , HCB , and trans-nonachlor were the dominant OCPs in most samples .
In addition , concentrations of 22 OCPs were measured by the isotope dilution method with GC-HRMS , which gave accurate and precise data for investigations of trend and international comparisons .
The dominant PCBs were PCB153 , 138 , 180 , 187 , and PCB118 , which contributed 60% to total PCBs .
The median concentrations of total OCPs and total PCBs were 315 ng g(-1) lipid and 104 ng g(-1) lipid , respectively .
In females , the serum concentrations of all determined organochlorine compounds except beta-HCH were positively correlated with age , and higher concentrations of organochlorine pollutants were found in males than in females .
Compared to our previous studies , PCB concentrations in serum from urban areas have substantially decreased during the last decade leading to the observation that the strict regulation of PCBs was helpful in controlling the concentration of PCBs in the environment .
Extensive monitoring programs are required for evaluating the concentrations of OCPs and PCBs in serum samples of the general population as an indicator of possible adverse health effects .
