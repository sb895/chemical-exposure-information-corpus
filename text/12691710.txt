There are numerous observations of pharmaceuticals ( or their metabolites ) as contaminants in wastewater , surface water and groundwater .
This implies a potential for indirect human exposure to pharmaceuticals via drinking water supplies .
Various effect benchmarks may be employed in an evaluation of the significance of such indirect exposure .
In this study a comparison was made between reported concentrations of pharmaceuticals in German drinking water and therapeutic dose .
The margin between potential indirect daily exposure via drinking water and daily therapeutic dose was at least three orders of magnitude and typically much more .
For certain compounds it was also possible to benchmark exposure against ADIs derived within the context of meat and food stuff residues following veterinary use .
In all cases potential exposure was less than the ADIs , similarly suggesting that for these compounds there are no substantial concerns with regards to indirect exposure via drinking water .
