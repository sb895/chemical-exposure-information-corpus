The objective of this paper was to document mercury contamination of Amerindian populations living along the Beni River in Bolivia and to examine risk factors related to their lifestyle .
A cross-sectional survey was performed among 15 communities on the flood plains of the Beni River at the foothills of the Andes .
Hair mercury content ( H-Hg ) served as a bioindicator of mercury contamination .
Mercury values were available for 556 people .
Four indicators of lifestyle were analyzed : community accessibility , subsistence activity , fish consumption , and ethnicity ( i.e. , members of the Tacana or Ese Ejja ethnic group ) .
The median of H-Hg was equal to 4.0 microg/g ( 95% CI [ confidence interval ] = 3.6-4.4 ) .
Approximately 86% of the subjects had H-Hg values lower than 10 microg/g .
No significant differences existed in H-Hg between adult women and children , nor according to age group .
Subjects belonging to the Ese Ejja ethnic group had higher H-Hg than subjects from the Tacanas ethnic group .
Communities accessible only by canoe were more frequently contaminated than those accessible by road .
Subjects who ate at least one serving of fish per day had higher H-Hg , and families who maintained substantial fishing activity were more strongly contaminated .
Contamination levels were found to be low compared with other Amazonian studies .
The most strongly affected groups , however , were those which preserved a traditional way of life and were the most economically and socially disadvantaged .
