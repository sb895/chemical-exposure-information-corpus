While studies show that ultrafine and fine particles can be translocated from the lungs to the central nervous system , the possible neurodegenerative effect of air pollution remains largely unexplored .
The authors examined the relation between black carbon , a marker for traffic particles , and cognition among 202 Boston , Massachusetts , children ( mean age = 9.7 years ( standard deviation , 1.7) ) in a prospective birth cohort study ( 1986-2001 ) .
Local black carbon levels were estimated using a validated spatiotemporal land-use regression model ( mean predicted annual black carbon level , 0.56 mug/m(3) ( standard deviation , 0.13) ) .
The Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test were administered for assessment of cognitive constructs .
In analysis adjusting for sociodemographic factors , birth weight , blood lead level , and tobacco smoke exposure , black carbon ( per interquartile-range increase ) was associated with decreases in the vocabulary ( -2.2 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : -5.5 , 1.1 ) , matrices ( -4.0 , 95% CI : -7.6 , -0.5 ) , and composite intelligence quotient ( -3.4 , 95% CI : -6.6 , -0.3 ) scores of the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test and with decreases on the visual subscale ( -5.4 , 95% CI : -8.9 , -1.9 ) and general index ( -3.9 , 95% CI : -7.5 , -0.3 ) of the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning .
Higher levels of black carbon predicted decreased cognitive function across assessments of verbal and nonverbal intelligence and memory constructs .
