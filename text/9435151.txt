This study evaluated the acute effects of ambient ozone ( O3 ) , fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) , and strong aerosol acidity on the pulmonary function of exercising adults .
During the summers of 1991 and 1992 , volunteers ( 18-64 years of age ) were solicited from hikers on Mt .
Washington , New Hampshire .
Volunteer nonsmokers with complete covariates ( n = 530 ) had pulmonary function measured before and after their hikes .
We calculated each hiker's posthike percentage change in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec ( FEV1 ) , forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , the ratio of these two ( FEV1/FVC ) , forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of FVC(FEF25-75%) , and peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) .
Average O3 exposures ranged from 21 to 74 ppb .
After adjustment for age,sex , smoking status ( former versus never ) , history of asthma or wheeze , hours hiked , ambient temperature , and other covariates , there was a 2.6% decline in FEV1 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.4-4.7 ; p = 0.02 ] and a 2.2% decline in FVC ( CI , 0.8-3.5 ; p =0.003 ) for each 50 ppb increment in mean O3 .
There were consistent associations of decrements in both FVC ( 0.4% decline ; CI,0.2-0.6 , p = 0.001 ) and PEFR ( 0.8% decline ; CI , 0.01-1.6 ; p = 0.05 ) with PM2.5 and of decrements in PEFR ( 0.4% decline ; CI , 0.1-0.7 ; p = 0.02 ) with strong aerosol acidity across the interquartile range of these exposures .
Hikers with asthma or a history of wheeze ( n = 40 ) had fourfold greater responsiveness to ozone than others .
With prolonged outdoor exercise , low-level exposures to O3 , PM2.5 , and strong aerosol acidity were associated with significant effects on pulmonary function among adults .
Hikers with a history of asthma or wheeze had significantly greater air pollution-related changes in pulmonary function .
