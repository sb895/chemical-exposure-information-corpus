Due to their widespread diffusion , perfluoroalkyl substances ( PFASs ) have been frequently found in the environment and in several animal species .
It has been demonstrated that they can easily reach also humans , mainly through diet .
Being lactation a major route of elimination of these contaminants , their occurrence in human milk is of particular interest , especially considering that it generally represents the unique food source for newborns .
Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , the two most important compounds of this family , have been frequently found in human milk at variable concentrations , but still limited data are available .
The present study , the first conducted in Italy capable to detect these pollutants at ultra-trace levels by UPLC-MS/MS , confirmed the role of lactation as a relevant source of exposure for breastfed children .
The measured concentrations ranged between 15 and 288 ng/L for PFOS and between 24 and 241 ng/L for PFOA .
Moreover , mean concentrations and frequencies of both analytes resulted higher in milk samples provided by primiparous women , suggesting that the risk of intake might be higher for first-borns .
Finally , comparing these results with previous data , PFOS gradual decrease over time since year 2000 was confirmed .
