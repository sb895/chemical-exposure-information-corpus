We compared urinary levels of the metabolite methyl-5-hydroxy-2-benzimidazole carbamate ( 5-HBC ) among nursery workers exposed to the fungicide benomyl ( specifically Benlate 50 DF [ DuPont , Wilmington , DE] ) and workers not exposed to benomyl .
Environmental exposures were quantitated from gloves , body patches , and air samples collected with area and personal monitors .
The median concentration of 5-HBC in the urine of benomyl-exposed workers was 23.8 mumol of 5-HBC per mole of creatinine .
No 5-HBC was detected in the reference group .
Industrial hygiene results and biological monitoring findings indicate that use of Benlate 50 DF in the ornamental industry can lead to absorption of the active ingredient , benomyl .
Weighing , mixing , and application activities involved the highest exposures .
Dermal contact appeared to be the primary route of exposure .
