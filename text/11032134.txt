In northern Tanzania large numbers of small scale miners use mercury in the gold extraction process causing contamination of the environment and risks to human health .
Human exposure to Hg was assessed in populations in and around small scale gold mining camps by means of human hair and urine surveys .
We also determined Hg concentration in fish in aquatic bodies close to these camps .
Urinary Hg testing in three communities showed that 36% of the gold miners working with amalgam exceeded the WHO guideline concentration of 50 microg Hg/g creatinine .
Data from a hair survey of fishermen and farmers confirm that at present , the fish-eating population close to the southern tip of Lake Victoria is at low risk with regard to Hg exposure .
Concentrations in fish were low and > 90% of the hair samples from the fish-eating population were below 2 microg/g T-Hg .
Highest Hg concentrations in fish caught along the southern shores of Lake Victoria and in rivers draining from gold processing sites were detected in lungfish species ( Protopterus aethiopicus ) , and lowest Hg concentrations in tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus and Tilapia zilii ) .
