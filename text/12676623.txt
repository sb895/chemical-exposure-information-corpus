Consumption of food containing mercury has been identified as a health risk .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( U.S .
EPA ) and the National Academy of Sciences recommend keeping the whole blood mercury level < 5.0 microg/L or the hair level < 1.0 microg/g .
This corresponds to a reference dose ( RfD ) of 0.1 microg/kg body weight per day .
All patients in a 1-year period ( n = 720 ) who came for an office visit in a private internal medicine practice in San Francisco , California , were evaluated for mercury excess using the current RfD .
One hundred twenty-three patients were tested ( 93 females , 30 males ) .
Of these , data were statistically analyzed for 89 subjects .
Mercury levels ranged from 2.0 to 89.5 microg/L for the 89 subjects .
The mean for 66 women was 15 microg/L [ standard deviation ( SD ) = 15 ] , and for 23 men was 13 microg/L ( SD = 5 ) ; 89% had levels exceeding the RfD .
Subjects consumed 30 different forms or types of fish .
Swordfish had the highest correlation with mercury level .
Sixty-seven patients with serial blood levels over time after stopping fish showed a decline in mercury levels ; reduction was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) .
A substantial fraction of patients had diets high in fish consumption ; of these , a high proportion had blood mercury levels exceeding the maximum level recommended by the U.S. EPA and National Academy of Sciences .
The mean level for women in this survey was 10 times that of mercury levels found in a recent population survey by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Some children were > 40 times the national mean .
