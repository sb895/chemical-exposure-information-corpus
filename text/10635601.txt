Lead and cadmium concentration was determined in the hair of 327 school children living in a wastewater spreading field of Marrakesh ( Morocco ) .
The influence of age , sex , food habits and family occupation on the children's hair Pb and Cd concentration was also evaluated .
Girls had more metal in their hair than boys ( 16.5 +/- 5.4 micrograms/g and 12.5 +/- 3.5 micrograms/g , respectively ) .
However , for Cd the boys had more metal ( 2.9 +/- 0.6 and 2.2 +/- 0.4 , respectively ) but the difference was not statistically significant and metal levels decreased with age .
Family occupation , direct contact with wastewater , customs and food habits were the most significant factors influencing the metal content of children's hair .
The average Pb and Cd content were higher in the exposed children ( 14.8 +/- 4.5 micrograms/g and 2.5 +/- 0.5 micrograms/g , respectively ) than in the non-exposed children ( 4.6 +/- 2.2 micrograms/g and 0.6 +/- 0.2 , respectively ) , but the difference was not statistically significant .
This study shows that in this area all the population ( especially children ) was extremely exposed to the danger caused by potentially toxic metals .
