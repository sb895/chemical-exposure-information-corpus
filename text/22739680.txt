To address the knowledge gaps regarding inhalation exposure of flight crew to polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) on airplanes , we measured PBDE concentrations in air samples collected in the cabin air at cruising altitudes and used Bayesian Decision Analysis ( BDA ) to evaluate the likelihood of inhalation exposure to result in the average daily dose ( ADD ) of a member of the flight crew to exceed EPA Reference Doses ( RfDs ) , accounting for all other aircraft and non-aircraft exposures .
A total of 59 air samples were collected from different aircraft and analyzed for four PBDE congeners-BDE 47 , 99 , 100 and 209 ( a subset were also analyzed for BDE 183 ) .
For congeners with a published RfD , high estimates of ADD were calculated for all non-aircraft exposure pathways and non-inhalation exposure onboard aircraft ; inhalation exposure limits were then derived based on the difference between the RfD and ADDs for all other exposure pathways .
The 95th percentile measured concentrations of PBDEs in aircraft air were <1% of the derived inhalation exposure limits .
Likelihood probabilities of 95th percentile exposure concentrations >1% of the defined exposure limit were zero for all congeners with published RfDs .
