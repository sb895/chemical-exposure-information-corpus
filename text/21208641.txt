Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs ) , and tetrabromobiphenol-A ( TBBP-A ) were measured in a preliminary study of dust from passenger cabins and trunks of 14 UK cars .
Concentrations in cabin dust of HBCDs , TBBP-A , and BDEs 47 , 85 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 154 , 183 , 196 , 197 , 202 , 203 , 206 , 207 , 208 , and 209 exceeded significantly ( p<0.05 ) those in trunk dust .
Sampling cabin dust thus appears to provide a more accurate indicator of human exposure via car dust ingestion than trunk dust .
Elevated cabin concentrations are consistent with greater in-cabin use of BFRs .
In five cars , while no significant differences ( p>0.05 ) in concentrations of HBCDs and most PBDEs were detected in dust sampled from four different seating areas ; concentrations of TBBP-A and of PBDEs 154 , 206 , 207 , 208 , and 209 were significantly higher ( p<0.05 ) in dust sampled in the front seats .
Possible photodebromination of BDE-209 was indicated by significantly higher ( p<0.05 ) concentrations of BDE-202 in cabin dust .
In-vehicle exposure via dust ingestion to PBDEs , HBCDs and TBBP-A exceeded that via inhalation .
Comparison with overall exposure via diet , dust ingestion , and inhalation shows while in-vehicle exposure is a minor contributor to overall exposure to BDE-99 , \u03a3HBCDs , and TBBP-A , it is a significant pathway for BDE-209 .
