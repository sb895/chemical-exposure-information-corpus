OBJECTIVE To determine the relationships between tibial bone lead and serum polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) concentrations and neurocognitive function .
METHODS The study population consisted of men and women former capacitor workers had been employed by the General Electric Corporation between 1946 and 1977 .
Regression analyses evaluated the association between neurocognitive function and lipid-adjusted serum PCB and tibia lead concentrations .
RESULTS Tibia lead , but not serum PCBs , was significantly correlated with deficits in neurocognitive function .
Women showed more associations between tibia lead and neurocognitive function than men , especially regarding executive function .
CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that low levels of tibia lead , but not serum PCBs , are associated with neurocognitive deficits and that postmenopausal women show a greater number of deficits in executive function than men .
