This study analyzed lead levels in scalp hair of child and adolescent street vendors in Istanbul .
The mean lead in hair concentration found among children exposed to intensive motor traffic , 11.82 +/- 6.89 microg/g , was over five times higher than that in the control group , 2.70 +/- 2.30 microg/g .
Vendors from a location with higher traffic density had significantly higher lead in hair levels , than vendors from a location with lower traffic density ( 14.18+/- 5.33 and 9.86 +/- 7.54 microg/g , respectively ) .
The results pointed to the dose-response effect between traffic intensity and lead in hair concentration .
Despite low lead content in gasoline , an intensive exposure to motor traffic may be a nonnegligible source of lead and poses a considerable health risk for individuals who work in particularly busy locations .
