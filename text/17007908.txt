The bactericide triclosan is commonly used in e.g. plastics , textiles and health care products .
In vitro studies on rat and human biological systems indicate that triclosan might exert adverse effects in humans .
Triclosan has previously been found in human plasma and milk , but neither the primary source of human exposure nor the efficiency of triclosan transfer to human milk is known .
In this study , plasma and milk were sampled from 36 mothers and analyzed for triclosan .
Scrutinization of the women's personal care products revealed that nine of the mothers used toothpaste , deodorant or soap containing triclosan .
Triclosan and/or its metabolites were omnipresent in the analyzed plasma and milk .
The concentrations were higher in both plasma and milk from the mothers who used personal care products containing triclosan than in the mothers who did not .
This demonstrated that personal care products containing triclosan were the dominant , but not the only , source of systemic exposure to triclosan .
The concentrations were significantly higher in plasma than in milk , indicating that infant exposure to triclosan via breast milk is much less than the dose in the mother .
