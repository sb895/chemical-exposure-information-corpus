This study is designed to determine the placental zinc ( Zn ) and cadmium ( Cd ) levels in mothers who were smokers , mothers who were thought to be exposed to air pollution , and mothers who were non-smokers and to investigate the relationship between the expression of placental metallothionein ( MT ) binding these metals and blood progesterone level .
Placental Zn and Cd levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry .
Presence of placental MT was determined immunohistochemically .
Placental changes were examined by light microscope after H&E and PAS staining .
Immunohistochemical MT staining of syncytiotrophoblastic and villous interstitial cells were scored as positive or negative .
Among the 92 mothers included in the study , 33 were smokers ( Group I ) , 29 had been exposed to air pollution ( Group II ) and 30 were non-smoker rural residents who had never been exposed to air pollution ( Group III ) .
Mean off-spring birth weight of 3198.62+/-380.01 g and mean placenta weight of 561.38+/-111.55 g of Group II were lower when compared with those of other two groups .
In Group I , mean placental Cd and Zn were 0.063+/-0.022 microg/g and 39.84+/-15.5 microg/g , respectively , being higher than in other groups .
In Group II , mean placental Cd and Zn levels were higher than those of Group III .
Blood progesterone levels of subjects in Group I ( 121 ng/ml ) were the lowest of all groups .
While the mean count of villi was the highest in Group III ; the highest mean count of syncytial knots was in Group II .
Thickening of vasculo-syncytial membrane was most prominent in Group I. Similarly , MT staining was positive and very dense in 72.7% ( 24/33 ) of cases in Group I ( p<or=0.05 ) .
MT staining was positive in 69.0% ( 29/20 ) and denser in Group II cases compared to 36% ( 11/30 ) in Group III ( p<or=0.05 ) .
This study showed that smoking increased Cd levels in placenta and accompanied an increase in placental MT expression immunohistochemically .
The effects of exposure to air pollution are equally harmful as smoking related effects .
