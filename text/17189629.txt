Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and some organochlorine pesticides , which continue to be measurable in a high proportion of blood samples from the general population , have been found to alter thyroid hormone levels in animals and humans .
However , studies of these relationships in adult men are limited and results across studies have been inconsistent .
In the present study , we measured serum levels of 57 PCB congeners , dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( p,p(')-DDE , a stable metabolite of DDT ) , and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , as well as free T(4) , total T(3) , and TSH , in 341 adult men recruited from an infertility clinic from 2000 to 2003 .
In multivariate linear regression , there were positive associations between p,p(')-DDE and both free T(4) and total T(3) , and an inverse association between p,p(')-DDE and TSH .
Conversely , for PCBs there was only a suggestive inverse association between PCB 153 and total T(3) when potential confounding variables were considered .
However , when results were additionally adjusted for p,p(')-DDE , inverse associations with T(3) were significant for PCB 138 , PCB 153 , sum of PCBs and three different PCB groupings , and HCB , while the positive associations between p,p(')-DDE and T(3) also remained .
In conclusion , serum concentrations of PCBs , p,p(')-DDE , and HCB were associated with circulating thyroid hormone levels in adult men .
