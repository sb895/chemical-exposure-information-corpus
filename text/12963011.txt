High levels of acrylamide have been found in foods heated at high temperatures , especially in carbohydrate rich foods .
Several kinds of foods ( industrially produced ) representing different food/product groups available on the Swedish market have been analysed for acrylamide .
A considerable variation in levels of acrylamide between single foodstuffs ( different brands ) within food categories were found , which also applies for levels in different food categories .
Using recent Swedish food consumption data the dietary intake of acrylamide for the Swedish adult population was assessed based on foodstuffs with low to high levels of acrylamide ( <30-2300 microg/kg ) , such as processed potato products , bread , breakfast cereals , biscuits , cookies , snacks and coffee .
The estimated dietary intake of acrylamide per person ( total population ) given as the 5th , 50th and 95th percentile were 9.1 , 27 and 62 microg/day respectively , from those food/product groups ( mean 31 microg/day ) .
No acrylamide was found in many other foodstuffs analysed and those were therefore not included in the dietary intake assessment of acrylamide .
However , an additional minor contribution of a few microg/day of acrylamide from foods/products like poultry , meat , fish , cocoa powder and chocolates cannot be excluded .
An average daily intake of 35 microg corresponds to 0.5 microg per kg body weight and day ( body weight 70 kg ) .
Risk assessments of acrylamide , made by US EPA and WHO , imply that this dietary intake of acrylamide could be associated with potential health risks .
