Propylene glycol and glycol ether ( PGE ) in indoor air have recently been associated with asthma and allergies as well as sensitization in children .
In this follow-up report , sources of the PGEs in indoor air were investigated in 390 homes of pre-school age children in Sweden .
Professional building inspectors examined each home for water damages , mold odour , building's structural characteristics , indoor temperature , absolute humidity and air exchange rate .
They also collected air and dust samples .
The samples were analyzed for four groups of volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) and semi-VOCs ( SVOCs ) , including summed concentrations of 16 PGEs , 8 terpene hydrocarbons , 2 Texanols , and the phthalates n-butyl benzyl phthalate ( BBzP ) , and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( DEHP ) .
Home cleaning with water and mop \u2265 once/month , repainting \u2265 one room prior to or following the child's birth , and " newest " surface material in the child's bedroom explained largest portion of total variability in PGE concentrations .
High excess indoor humidity ( g/mÂ³ ) additionally contributed to a sustained PGE levels in indoor air far beyond several months following the paint application .
No behavioral or building structural factors , except for water-based cleaning , predicted an elevated terpene level in air .
No significant predictor of Texanols emerged from our analysis .
Overall disparate sources and low correlations among the PGEs , terpenes , Texanols , and the phthalates further confirm the lack of confounding in the analysis reporting the associations of the PGE and the diagnoses of asthma , rhinitis , and eczema , respectively .
