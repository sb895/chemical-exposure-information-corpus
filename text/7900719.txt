Mortality from several cancers , including bladder cancer , is elevated in a Taiwanese population exposed to high levels of arsenic in drinking water .
Data from the Utah respondents to the National Bladder Cancer Study conducted in 1978 were used to evaluate these associations in a US population exposed to measurable , but much lower , levels of drinking water arsenic .
Two indices of cumulative arsenic exposure were used , one representing total cumulative exposure ( index 1 ) and the other , intake concentration ( index 2 ) .
Overall , there was no association of bladder cancer with either measure ; however , among smokers , but not among nonsmokers , positive trends in risk were found for exposures estimated for decade-long time periods , especially in the 30- to 39-year period prior to diagnosis .
Exposures were in the range 0.5-160 micrograms/liter ( mean , 5.0 micrograms/liter ) .
The data raise the possibility that smoking potentiates the effect of arsenic on risk of bladder cancer .
However , the risk estimates obtained are much higher than predicted on the basis of the results of the Taiwanese studies , raising concerns about bias or the role of chance .
Confirmatory studies are needed .
