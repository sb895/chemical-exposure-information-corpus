Samples of unpasteurised bulked milk , taken directly from ten herds of dairy cattle on rural and urban farms in the north west of England on five separate sampling occasions , were analysed for a range of PCB congeners .
Sigma PCB concentrations ( sum of 37 congeners ) ranged from 3.4-16.4 ng/g milk fat with a mean sigma PCB concentration of 8.4 ng/g milk fat .
The dominating congeners were 118 , 153 , 138 and 180 , which contributed 15% , 20% , 17% and 9% of the sigma PCB load respectively .
The chlorine pattern of the congeners which made moderate or major contributions to the sigma PCB concentration were typically substituted at both para positions ( 4,4' ) , while the PCB congeners not detected in the milk had at least one ring that was not 4-substituted .
These results indicate the 4,4 ' substitution pattern as being the key to PCB persistence in cows .
It is estimated that consumption of typical daily intakes of milk with the PCB concentrations measured in this study would contribute 11% of the average daily sigma PCB intake for individuals in the UK .
This contribution would increase to 30% when exposure through the consumption of dairy products prepared from such milk ( e.g. cheese , butter ) is taken into account .
It is estimated that the inclusion of the TEF assigned PCBs would typically increase the TEQ rating of cows ' milk by approximately 40% over that attributed to PCDD/Fs alone .
