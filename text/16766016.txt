Polybromodiphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and polybromobiphenyls ( PBBs ) were investigated in adipose tissue of women living in Southeastern Spain .
Mean Sigma PBDE ( BDE 28 , 75 , 71 , 47 , 66 , 77 , 100 , 119 , 99 , 85 , 154 , 153 , 138 , and 183 ) and Sigma PBB ( PBB 18 , 29 , 31 , 22 , 38 , 37 , 53 , 52 , 49 , 75 , 80 , 56 , 77 , 103 , 101 , 155 , 154 , 153 , and 169 ) levels were 3.85 and 0.36 ng/g of lipid , respectively .
Among PBDEs , congeners 153 , 47 , 183 , 99 , and 100 were the most frequent and abundant and together constituted 96% of the total amount of PBDEs in adipose tissue .
Concentrations of PBDEs in this population were similar to those reported in other parts of Spain and in Swedish and Belgium populations but lower than those found in other Western countries .
Among PBB congeners studied , PBB 153 presented the highest concentrations and contributed 79% of all PBBs .
There are no published data on PBB congeners in adipose tissues of the Spanish population for comparison , but the levels found were similar to those described in other European countries .
Further research is needed to determine trends in human exposure to PBDEs and PBBs and to explore putative effects on human health .
