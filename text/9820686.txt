Breast milk samples were collected and analysed within a comprehensive programme co-ordinated by WHO EURO to evaluate the possible health risk for breast-fed infants in chosen localities of European countries ( 'exposed ' and ' control ' ones ) .
The samples of breast milk were collected , stored transported and analysed by a standardised study protocol to assure the comparability of the results from different areas ( of 19 European countries ) .
The study included three categories of chemicals : polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs)/polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , dioxine like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and other PCBs .
The results obtained confirmed the correct choice of ' exposed ' and ' control ' regions in the Czech Republic as a suitable tool used to identify certain geographical areas with relatively high exposure levels for further risk management actions and possible follow-up epidemiological studies .
The results obtained have shown high levels of PCBs in exposed region but not in the dioxine-like fraction , that ranged within a lower rank of a relevant European data .
PCDs/PCDFs levels ranged in the same lower rank of values in comparison with e.g .
Benelux countries .
The data of this study does not confirm ideas about wide spread excessive exposure of central European population to polyhalogenated hydrocarbons via excessive contamination of a local food basket .
