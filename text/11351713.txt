Air samples from a plant engaged in recycling electronics goods , a factory assembling printed circuit boards , a computer repair facility , offices equipped with computers , and outdoor air have been analyzed with respect to their content of brominated hydrocarbon and phosphate ester flame retardants .
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers , polybrominated biphenyls , 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)-ethane , tetrabromobisphenol A , and organophosphate esters were all detected in the indoor air samples , with the highest concentrations being detected in air from the recycling plant .
In air from the dismantling hall at the recycling plant the average concentrations of decabromodiphenyl ether , tetrabromobisphenol A , and triphenyl phosphate were 38 , 55 , and 58 pmol/m3 , respectively .
Significantly higher levels of all of these additives were present in air in the vicinity of the shredder at the dismantling plant .
This is the first time that 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)-ethane and several arylated phosphate esters are reported to be contaminants of air in occupational settings .
At all of the other sites investigated , low levels of flame retardants were detected in the indoor air .
Flame retardants associated with airborne particles , present at elevated levels , pose a potential health hazard to the exposed workers .
