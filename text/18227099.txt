Exposure to airborne particulate matter has been linked to cardiovascular events .
Whether this finding reflects an effect of particulate matter exposure on the triggering of events or development of atherosclerosis remains unknown .
Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis collected at baseline ( 2000-2002 ) , the authors investigated associations of 20-year exposures to particulate matter with measures of subclinical disease ( coronary calcium , common carotid intimal-medial thickness , and ankle-brachial index ) in 5,172 US adults without clinical cardiovascular disease .
Particulate matter exposures for the 20 years prior to assessment of subclinical disease were obtained from a space-time model of Environmental Protection Agency monitor data linked to residential history data for each participant .
Intimal-medial thickness was weakly , positively associated with exposures to particulate matter <10 microm in aerodynamic diameter and <2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter after controlling for age , sex , race/ethnicity , socioeconomic factors , diet , smoking , physical activity , blood lipids , diabetes , hypertension , and body mass index ( 1-4% increase per 21-microg/m(3) increase in particulate matter <10 microm in aerodynamic diameter or a 12.5-microg/m(3) increase in particulate matter <2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ) .
No consistent associations with other measures of atherosclerosis were observed .
There was no evidence of effect modification by sociodemographic factors , lipid status , smoking , diabetes , body mass index , or site .
Results are compatible with some effect of particulate matter exposures on development of carotid atherosclerosis .
