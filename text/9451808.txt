Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins ( PCDDs ) , Polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are among the most toxic environmental pollutants .
We determined blood levels of these compounds in a population sample of the city of Matar√≥ , Spain .
Blood samples were drawn from a randomly selected sample of 198 subjects , of both genders , aged 18 to 69 years .
These samples were pooled into 10 groups for laboratory analysis .
For males , total level of PCDDs was 505.7 ppt , of PCDFs was 26.7 ppt , and the international toxic equivalent ( I-TEQ ) was 12.5 .
For females the levels were 739 ppt , 28.8 ppt and 14.71-TEQ , respectively .
The most important contributors to the total I-TEQ were HexaCDD , PentaCDD and PentaCDF .
The blood concentration of total PCBs was 2.02 mg/l in males , and 1.58 mg/l in females .
Levels of PCDDs , PCDFs and PCBs increased by age in both sexes .
The levels of PCDDs and PCDFs in residents of this Mediterranean city are among the lowest observed in industrialized countries .
