The respiratory effects of dusts in different sections of yarn , cement , and cigarette factories were studied in 211 nonsmoking male and female workers aged 21-57 years .
The controls used were 211 healthy nonsmoking and nonexposed male and female subjects aged 20-57 years from the general population .
Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume in 1 sec ( FEV1 ) , FEV1/FVC ratio , forced expiratory flow ( FEF200-1,200 ml ) , forced mid-expiratory flow ( FMF25-75% ) and peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) were recorded in all subjects with and without respiratory symptoms .
Taking exposures to all dusts of different concentrations together , it was found that the frequency of respiratory illness was greater among exposed workers ( 40.5% in males , 36% in females ) than it was among controls ( 21.6% in males , 18% in females ) .
In exposed subjects , the symptom prevalence was only 4.5% higher in males than in females .
The mean lung function indices , including FEV1 , FEV1% , FEF200-1,200 ml , FMF25-75% , and PEFR , in subjects exposed to all dusts in general decreased markedly , with dust concentration being more important than duration of exposure , and FMF being affected slightly more consistently .
About 38.4% of the dust-exposed subjects developed corresponding respiratory illnesses including chronic cough ( 24.7% ) , chronic bronchitis ( 21.8% ) and bronchial asthma ( 24.2% ) .
The respective control values were 9.0% , 9.5% , and 8.5% .
Exposure to different occupational dusts resulted in the development of respiratory illness with different rates of prevalence .
The effects of exposure to cotton and cement dusts on respiratory health of exposed subjects were relatively more significant ( p < 0.001 ) than that of exposure to tobacco dust ( p < 0.05 ) .
