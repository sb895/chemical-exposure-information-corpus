We conducted a study within the framework of the interdisciplinary European Mercury Emission from Chloralkali Plants ( EMECAP ) project to assess exposure to mercury ( Hg ) and the contribution of Hg emissions from a mercury cell chloralkali plant to urinary mercury ( U-Hg ) in adults living near the plant .
We collected data from questionnaires and first morning urine samples from 75 subjects living near the Tarnow plant in Poland and 100 subjects living in a reference area .
Median U-Hg was 0.32 mug/g creatinine ( microg/gC ) and 0.20 microg/gC , respectively .
The median U-Hg was also higher in the amalgam-free subjects living near the plant ( 0.26 microg/gC ) than in the reference group ( 0.18 microg/gC ) , but no such association was found in a multivariate analysis .
There was a statistically significant positive association between U-Hg and number of teeth with amalgams , a negative association with age and a tendency towards higher U-Hg in female subjects .
In the amalgam-free subjects there were statistically significant effects of female sex and fish consumption , and a negative association with age .
The additional long-term average air Hg concentration from the plant , based on EMECAP environmental measurements and modelling , was estimated to be 1-3.5 ng/m(3) for the residential study area and should have a very small effect on U-Hg .
The other Hg emission sources such as coal combustion facilities located nearby should be taken into account in assessing the overall impact of air Hg on U-Hg in this area .
