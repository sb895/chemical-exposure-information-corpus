BACKGROUND Nitrate is a precursor compound in the formation of N-nitroso compounds , most of which are potent animal carcinogens .
N-nitroso compounds and their precursors have not been extensively evaluated as bladder cancer risk factors .
METHODS We conducted a population-based case-control study of bladder cancer in Iowa .
Cases were men and women newly diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1986-1989 .
Nitrate data for Iowa public water supplies were sparse before the 1960s .
To reduce misclassification by unknown nitrate levels , we included only those who used public supplies with nitrate data for 70% or more of their person-years since 1960 ( 808 cases , 1259 controls ) .
RESULTS Among controls , the median average nitrate level for their Iowa residences with public water supplies was 1.3 mg/liter nitrate-nitrogen ( interquartile range = 0.6-3.0 ) .
After adjustment for confounders , we found no increased risk of bladder cancer with increasing average nitrate levels in drinking water ; the highest quartile odds ratio for women was 0.8 ( 95% confidence interval = 0.4-0.8 ) , and for men 0.5 ( 0.4-0.8 ) .
We observed no association among those with high water nitrate exposure ( >median ) and low ( <median ) vitamin C intake compared with those who had low water nitrate and high vitamin C intake .
CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that long-term exposure to nitrate in drinking water at levels in this study ( 90th percentile 5.5 mg/liter nitrate-nitrogen ) is not associated with risk of bladder cancer .
