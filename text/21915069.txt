OBJECTIVE Cytokeratin 18 ( CK18 ) is a novel serologic biomarker for occupational liver disease .
The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of CK18 elevation in elastomer/polymer workers exposed to acrylonitrile , 1,3-butadiene , and styrene .
METHODS A total of 82 chemical workers were evaluated .
Cytokeratin 18 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and proinflammatory cytokines were measured by multi-analyte chemiluminescent detection .
RESULTS Thirty-nine percent ( 32 of 82 ) had elevated CK18 levels , which were not explained by alcohol or obesity , except in potentially four cases .
The pattern of CK18 elevation was consistent with toxicant-associated steatohepatitis ( TASH ) in the majority of cases ( 78% ) .
Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 , interleukin-6 , interleukin-8 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were increased in these workers compared with those with normal CK18 levels .
CONCLUSIONS These results suggest a high prevalence of occupational liver disease and TASH in elastomer/polymer workers with elevated proinflammatory cytokines .
