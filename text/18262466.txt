Breast-feeding can be a source of mercury exposure for infants .
The main concern up to now is methyl-mercury exposure of women at child-bearing age .
Certain fish species have high levels of methyl-mercury leading to consumer's advisory guidelines in regard of fish consumption to protect infants from mercury exposure passing through breast milk .
Little is known about the transfer of inorganic mercury passing through breast milk to infants .
Epidemiological studies showed negative health effects of inorganic mercury in gold mining areas .
Small-scale gold miners use mercury to extract the gold from the ore .
Environmental and health assessments of gold mining areas in Indonesia , Tanzania and Zimbabwe showed a high exposure with inorganic mercury in these gold mining areas , and a negative health impact of the exposure to the miners and the communities .
This paper reports about the analysis and the results of 46 breast milk samples collected from mercury-exposed mothers .
The median level of 1.87mug/l is fairly high compared to other results from literature .
Some breast milk samples showed very high levels of mercury ( up to 149mug/l ) .
Fourteen of the 46 breast milk samples exceed 4mug/l which is considered to be a " high " level .
US EPA recommends a " Reference Dose " of 0.3mug inorganic mercury/kg body weight/day [ United States Environmental Protection Agency , 1997 .
Volume V : Health Effects of Mercury and Mercury Compounds .
Study Report EPA-452/R-97-007 : US EPA ] .
Twenty-two of the 46 children from these gold mining areas had a higher calculated total mercury uptake .
The highest calculated daily mercury uptake of 127mug exceeds by far the recommended maximum uptake of inorganic mercury .
Further systematic research of mercury in breast milk from small-scale gold mining areas is needed to increase the knowledge about the bio-transfer of mercury from mercury vapour-exposed mothers passing through breast milk to the breast-fed infant .
