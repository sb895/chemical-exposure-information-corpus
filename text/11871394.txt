Of the 2508 water samples analyzed in 10 districts of Bangladesh , 51% , on an average , contained arsenic levels of 0.05 to 2.50 mg/l. 95% of nail , 96% of hair , and 94% of urine samples contained arsenic above the normal level .
Approximately 3.58 million people out of a total of 17.92 million who are drinking water containing arsenic levels >0.20 mg/l are potentially exposed to high risk of health hazard .
Eight thousand and five hundred arsenic patients are identified ; they are suffering from various skin lesions , gangrene in leg , skin , lung , bladder , liver , and renal cancer .
A big portion of the total population is highly vulnerable to various internal cancers .
Lowest arsenic concentration in drinking water producing dermatological disease is found to be 0.103 mg/l .
However , the exposure time to develop arsenicosis varies from case to case reflecting its dependence on arsenic level in drinking water and food , nutritional status , genetic variant of human being , and compounding factors .
This study has determined the high intensity of fluorescent humic substances in drinking water containing elevated concentrations of arsenic and very low concentrations of heavy metals .
The synergistic/antagonistic effect of fluorescent compounds present in drinking water may aggravate the toxicity of arsenic .
Geochemical study suggests that arsenic may be released from both reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn ( oxy)hydroxide and microbial oxidation of organic matter .
