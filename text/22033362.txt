The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) has been increased among people who possess habit of tobacco smoking .
In the present study , zinc ( Zn ) , copper ( Cu ) , manganese ( Mn ) , lead ( Pb ) and cadmium ( Cd ) were determined in scalp hair samples of smokers and nonsmokers RA patients , residents of Dublin , Ireland .
For comparison purposes scalp hair samples of age and sex matched healthy smokers and nonsmokers were also analyzed .
The concentrations of understudied elements were measured by inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer , prior to microwave assisted acid digestion .
The validity and accuracy of methodology was checked using certified reference material ( NCS ZC 81002b ) and by the conventional wet acid digestion method on the same certified reference material and on real samples .
The mean hair Zn , Cu and Mn contents were significantly lower in smokers and nonsmokers RA patients as compared to healthy individuals ( p=0.01-0.001 ) .
Whereas the concentrations of Cd and Pb were significantly higher in scalp hair samples of RA patients of both group ( p<0.001 ) .
The referent smokers have high level of Cd and Pb in their scalp hair samples as compared to those had not smoking tobacco ( p<0.01 ) .
The ratio of Cd and Pb to Zn , Cu and Mn in scalp hair samples was also calculated .
The Cd/Zn ratio was higher in smoker RA patients with related to nonsmoker RA and referents .
This study is compelling evidence in support of positive associations between toxic elements , cigarette smoking , deficiency of essential trace elements and risk of arthritis .
