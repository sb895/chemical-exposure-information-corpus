The aim of this study was to measure , 6 years after regular operations , the concentrations of a number of organic substances in blood and urine of 19 workers employed at a hazardous waste incinerator ( HWI ) in Spain , and to establish the temporal variation with respect to baseline data and previously performed surveys .
This facility was the first , and so far the only HWI in that country .
The levels of hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB 28 , 52 , 101 , 138 , 153 and 180 ) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) were analyzed in six composite plasma samples , while concentrations of di- , tri , and pentachlorophenols , as well those of 1-hydroxypyrene were measured in the urine of these workers .
The current mean PCDD/F concentration , 10.4 ng I-TEQ/kg lipid , was significantly lower than that found in the baseline survey , 26.7 ng I-TEQ/kg lipid and similar to that found in the previous ( 2004 ) study ( 7.7 ng I-TEQ/kg lipid ) .
PCDD/F levels in plasma were similar or even lower than those recently reported for various non-exposed populations .
For the remaining analyzed substances in plasma and urine , there was not any significant increase in comparison with the levels found in the baseline survey .
On the other hand , no marked differences between the concentrations of organic substances in plasma or urine were found according to the respective workplace ( plant , laboratory and administration ) .
The results of the present survey indicate that after 6 years of regular operation , the workers at the HWI are not occupationally exposed to PCDD/Fs and other organic substances in their workplaces .
