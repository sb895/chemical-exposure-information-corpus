Human exposure to methylmercury ( MeHg ) , a known neurotoxin , is primarily from fish consumption .
As part of a large study examining the association between MeHg exposure and child development in a population with high fish consumption we examined school-age behavior using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) .
The CBCL Total T score was a primary endpoint and was reported earlier to show no adverse association with prenatal or postnatal MeHg exposure .
In this study we analyzed the T scores of the CBCL subscales to determine if more discrete aspects of measured behavior were associated with exposure .
The Seychelles Child Development Study ( SCDS ) is a prospective , double blind , longitudinal evaluation of over 700 children .
The index of prenatal exposure was maternal hair total mercury ( T-Hg ) in a segment growing during gestation .
Postnatal exposure was T-Hg in the child's hair taken at 66 months of age .
The child's primary caregiver completed the CBCL during the 66-month evaluation .
No association between prenatal or postnatal MeHg exposure and the CBCL subscales was found .
In Seychellois children exposed to MeHg from consumption of ocean fish we found no association between either prenatal or postnatal MeHg exposure and behavior as measured by the CBCL subscales .
