The question of what is leading to the apparent increase in autism is of great importance .
Like the link between aspirin and heart attack , even a small effect can have major health implications .
If there is any link between autism and mercury , it is absolutely crucial that the first reports of the question are not falsely stating that no link occurs .
We have reanalyzed the data set originally reported by Ip et al. in 2004 and have found that the original p value was in error and that a significant relation does exist between the blood levels of mercury and diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder .
Moreover , the hair sample analysis results offer some support for the idea that persons with autism may be less efficient and more variable at eliminating mercury from the blood .
