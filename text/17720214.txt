Lipophilic contaminants are present in the environment and bioaccumulate in the food chain .
Therefore , their intake via animal fat of various sources was assessed for three age groups of the Flemish population , participating in a large biomonitoring program of the Flemish government .
In total , 1636 adolescents ( 14-15 years ) , 1186 mothers ( 18-44 years ) , and 1586 adults ( 50-65 years ) participated in the study and completed a semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire .
Individual consumption data were combined , via a so-called simple distribution approach , with recent data on polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls , measured via the chemical-activated luciferase gene expression ( CALUX ) bio-assay in food items available on the Flemish market .
The median ( 95th percentile ) estimated intakes of dioxin-like contaminants were 2.24 ( 4.61 ) , 2.09 ( 4.26 ) , and 1.74 ( 3.53 ) pg CALUX-TEQ kg(-1) bw d(-1) for , respectively adolescents , mothers and adults .
These data are in the same range as those found in other European studies .
The CALUX-TEQ results of respectively 59.8% , 53.7% and 36.2% of the adolescent , mother and adult population exceed the tolerable weekly intake ( TWI ) of 14 pg WHO-TEQ kg(-1) bw w(-1) , as derived by the Scientific Committee on Food [ Scientific Committee on Food , 2001 .
Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on the Risk Assessment of Dioxins and Dioxin-like PCBs in Food , CS/CNTM/DIOXIN/20 final Brussels , Belgium ] .
The main contributors of dioxin-like substances are fish and seafood ( 25-43% of the total intake ) , added fats ( 22-25% of the total intake ) and dairy products ( 17-20% of the total intake ) .
