Concentrations of mercury and arsenic in fish from the Persian Gulf were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry .
Concentrations of the metals in muscle samples were 0.049-0.402\u03bcgg(-1) for mercury and 0.168-0.479\u03bcgg(-1) for arsenic , with means of 0.133 and 0.312\u03bcgg(-1) , respectively .
The maximum daily consumption rate ( grams per day ) and meal consumption limit ( meals per month ) was calculated to estimate health risks associated with fish consumption .
According to the results , the maximum allowable consumption rate varies between 8-56 and 15-96g/day base on mercury and arsenic content , respectively .
The results of this study indicate that the concentration of mercury and arsenic is well below the maximum permissible levels for mercury ( 0.5\u03bcgg(-1) ) and arsenic ( 6\u03bcgg(-1) ) according to international standards .
