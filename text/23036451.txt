We investigated whether prenatal exposure from the maternal diet to the toxicants polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and dioxins is associated with the development of immune-related diseases in childhood .
Children participating in BraMat , a sub-cohort of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study ( MoBa ) , were followed in the three first years of life using annual questionnaires ( 0-3years ; n=162 , 2-3years ; n=180 ) , and blood parameters were examined at three years of age ( n=114 ) .
The maternal intake of the toxicants was calculated using a validated food frequency questionnaire from MoBa .
Maternal exposure to PCBs and dioxins was found to be associated with an increased risk of wheeze and more frequent upper respiratory tract infections .
Furthermore , maternal exposure to PCBs and dioxins was found to be associated with reduced antibody response to a measles vaccine .
No associations were found between prenatal exposure and immunophenotype data , allergic sensitization and vaccine-induced antibody responses other than measles .
Our results suggest that prenatal dietary exposure to PCBs and dioxins may increase the risk of wheeze and the susceptibility to infectious diseases in early childhood .
