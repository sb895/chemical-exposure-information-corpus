Most humans have detectable body burdens of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , and p,p'-dichlorophenyldichloroethylene p,p'-DDE ) , a metabolite of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) .
Native American communities may be at increased risk of exposure through subsistence-based diets and greater physical contact with contaminated soil and water .
In this article we describe the levels of toxicants ( PCBs , p,p'-DDE , HCB , mirex , lead , and mercury ) among youth 10-17 years old ( n = 271 ) of the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation .
Ultratrace , congener-specific PCB analysis of human serum quantitated 83 PCB congeners ( plus 18 as pairs/triplets ) , in addition to p,p'-DDE , HCB , and mirex , and included all major Aroclor-derived congeners typically present in human samples .
Twenty congeners ( in 16 chromatographic peaks ) were detected in 50% or more of the individuals sampled [ geometric mean ( GM ) of the sum of these congeners = 0.66 ppb ] .
Thirteen congeners ( in 10 peaks ) were detected in 75% or more of the samples ( GM = 0.51 ppb ) .
Of the 20 congeners detected in 50% or more of the samples , 17 had five or more chlorine substitutions .
International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry congeners 118 , 101(+90) , and 153 were detected in nearly all participants ( GM = 0.06 ppb , 0.05 ppb , 0.09 ppb , respectively). p,p'-DDE and HCB were detected in 100% and 98% of the samples ( GM : p,p'-DDE = 0.37 ppb ; HCB = 0.03 ppb ) .
Mirex was detected in approximately 46% of the samples ( GM = 0.02 ppb ) .
No cases of elevated lead level were observed .
One participant had a mercury level marginally higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's current level of concern ( 0.50 microg/dL ) .
Although differences in analytic methods and participant ages limit comparability , toxicant levels from the Mohawk youth are lower than those associated with severe food contamination ( Yusho and Yu-cheng ) but similar to other chronically exposed groups .
