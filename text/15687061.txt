Increasing rates of cryptorchidism and hypospadias in human populations may be caused by exogenous environmental agents .
We conducted a case-control study of serum levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) and its major metabolite , p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( DDE ) , and cryptorchidism and hypospadias in the Child Health and Development Study , a longitudinal cohort of pregnancies that occurred between 1959 and 1967 , a period when DDT was produced and used in the United States .
Serum was available from the mothers of 75 male children born with cryptorchidism , 66 with hypospadias , and 4 with both conditions .
We randomly selected 283 controls from the cohort of women whose male babies were born without either of these conditions .
Overall , we observed no statistically significant relationships or trends between outcomes and serum measures .
After adjusting for maternal race , triglyceride level , and cholesterol level , compared with boys whose mothers had serum DDE levels < 27.0 ng/mL , boys whose mothers had serum DDE levels > or = 61.0 ng/mL had odds ratios of 1.34 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.51-3.48 ] for cryptorchidism and 1.18 ( 95% CI , 0.46-3.02 ) for hypospadias .
For DDT , compared with boys whose mothers had serum DDT levels < 10.0 ng/mL , boys whose mothers had serum DDT levels > or = 20.0 ng/mL had adjusted odds ratios of 1.01 ( 95% CI , 0.44-2.28 ) for cryptorchidism and 0.79 ( 95% CI , 0.33-1.89 ) for hypospadias .
This study does not support an association of DDT or DDE and hypospadias or cryptorchidism .
