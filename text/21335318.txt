BACKGROUND New approaches to link health surveillance data with environmental and population exposure information are needed to examine the health benefits of risk management decisions .
OBJECTIVE We examined the feasibility of conducting a local assessment of the public health impacts of cumulative air pollution reduction activities from federal , state , local , and voluntary actions in the City of New Haven , Connecticut ( USA ) .
METHODS Using a hybrid modeling approach that combines regional and local-scale air quality data , we estimated ambient concentrations for multiple air pollutants [ e.g. , PM2.5 ( particulate matter \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter ) , NOx ( nitrogen oxides) ] for baseline year 2001 and projected emissions for 2010 , 2020 , and 2030 .
We assessed the feasibility of detecting health improvements in relation to reductions in air pollution for 26 different pollutant-health outcome linkages using both sample size and exploratory epidemiological simulations to further inform decision-making needs .
RESULTS Model projections suggested decreases ( in pollutant concentrations , mainly attributable to decreases in pollutants from local sources between 2001 and 2010 .
Models indicated considerable spatial variability in the concentrations of most pollutants .
Sample size analyses supported the feasibility of identifying linkages between reductions in NOx and improvements in all-cause mortality , prevalence of asthma in children and adults , and cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations .
CONCLUSION Substantial reductions in air pollution ( e.g. , for NOx ) are needed to detect health impacts of environmental actions using traditional epidemiological study designs in small communities like New Haven .
In contrast , exploratory epidemiological simulations suggest that it may be possible to demonstrate the health impacts of PM reductions by predicting intraurban pollution gradients within New Haven using coupled models .
