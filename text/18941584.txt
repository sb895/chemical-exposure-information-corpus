BACKGROUND Coal burning provides 70% of the energy for China's industry and power , but releases large quantities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) and other pollutants .
PAHs are reproductive and developmental toxicants , mutagens , and carcinogens .
OBJECTIVE We evaluated the benefit to neurobehavioral development from the closure of a coal-fired power plant that was the major local source of ambient PAHs .
METHODS The research was conducted in Tongliang , Chongqing , China , where a coal-fired power plant operated seasonally before it was shut down in May 2004 .
Two identical prospective cohort studies enrolled nonsmoking women and their newborns in 2002 ( before shutdown ) and 2005 ( after shutdown ) .
Prenatal PAH exposure was measured by PAH-DNA adducts ( benzo[a]pyrene-DNA ) in umbilical cord blood .
Child development was assessed by the Gesell Developmental Schedules at 2 years of age .
Prenatal exposure to other neurotoxicants and potential confounders ( including lead , mercury , and environmental tobacco smoke ) was measured .
We compared the cohorts regarding the association between PAH-DNA adduct levels and neurodevelopmental outcomes .
RESULTS Significant associations previously seen in 2002 between elevated adducts and decreased motor area developmental quotient ( DQ ) ( p = 0.043 ) and average DQ ( p = 0.047 ) were not observed in the 2005 cohort ( p = 0.546 and p = 0.146 ) .
However , the direction of the relationship did not change .
CONCLUSION The findings indicate that neurobehavioral development in Tongliang children benefited by elimination of PAH exposure from the coal-burning plant , consistent with the significant reduction in PAH-DNA adducts in cord blood of children in the 2005 cohort .
The results have implications for children's environmental health in China and elsewhere .
