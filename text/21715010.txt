Dietary exposure to persistent organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) was assessed for Chinese populations , using the total diet study ( TDS ) approach in 2007 .
Multistage random cluster sampling method was used in this study. 108 composite samples , representative of foods " as consumed " by the Chinese were analyzed for residues of OCPs by a multi-residue method .
The result showed that hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane ( DDT ) , chlordane compounds ( CHLs ) , hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) and heptachlor could be detected in , respectively 84% , 39% , 37% , 13% and 5% of all samples .
Concentrations of DDT in all samples ranged from undetectable levels to 72.2 \u03bcg/kg .
Others were minor components in the OCPs profile .
The residual levels of OCPs were significantly below the Extraneous Maximum Residue Limits ( EMRLs ) .
Based on the 2000 nationwide food consumption survey , the average dietary exposure of the Chinese to DDT , HCH , HCB , CHLs , and heptachlor was estimated to be 0.016 , 0.002 , 0.009 , 0.006 , and 0.001 \u03bcg/kg body weight per day respectively , showing a significant decrease trend compared with the past .
The major food groups contributing to dietary OCPs were aquatic foods , meats , and cereals .
The average and high end estimated daily intakes of different OCPs for the Chinese were both lower than the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) suggested by authorities indicating low health risk of OCPs dietary exposure among Chinese adults at present .
However , the risk of carcinogenicity of the OCPs should be concerned with if the carcinogenicity effects from the exposures to these OCPs were considered .
