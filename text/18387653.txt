1,1,1-trichloro-2,2'-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane ( DDT ) exhibits its long persistence in the environment , unusual bioaccumulation , effects on wildlife , and the possibility of long-term adverse effects on human health , especially reproductive toxicity .
Despite the prohibition of most persistent organochlorine pesticides in China , the presence of organochlorine residue , including DDT , has been widely indicated in environmental substance .
However , scarce information is available about accumulative levels of DDT in human tissues in China .
To evaluate levels of DDT and its potential effects on women and children's health in a Chinese pesticide-exposed area , we recruited 50 pairs of mother-child and 50 postpartum women , and determined the levels of total DDT and its four main metabolites ( p,p'-DDE , p,p'-DDT , p,p'-DDD , o,p'-DDT ) in venous blood , breast milk and umbilical blood cord by gas chromatography .
Accordingly , data on reproductive outcomes of mothers and postpartum women and healthy status of children and infants were gathered through a questionnaire and medical examinations .
Furthermore , we also assayed the DDT levels of some environmental samples ( soil , food , milk , et al. ) .
The levels of DDT in children's blood were higher than that in the women's .
As compared to breast milk , the umbilical blood cord and the ventral fat individually demonstrated a significantly lower and higher level of DDT in the postpartum women .
DDT was lower in milk and crucian carp than in the soil near the chemical plant. p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE were the main metabolites of DDT .
Our findings suggested the cumulative effect of DDT in human body in Tianjin , China .
