Renal effects of cadmium exposure in people living in a cadmium-nonpolluted area in Japan were investigated .
The population consisted of 1501 inhabitants ( 558 men and 743 women ) over 50 years of age .
Urinary cadmium was employed as an indicator of internal dose , and total urinary protein , beta 2-microglobulin , and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase were used as indicators of renal dysfunction .
Multiple regression analysis and a logistic regression analysis were performed to study the relationship between urinary cadmium excretion and these indicators of renal dysfunction .
In both procedures , urinary cadmium concentrations were significantly associated with indicators of renal dysfunction .
These results suggest the existence of renal dysfunction induced by exposure to environmental cadmium in a cadmium-nonpolluted area in Japan .
