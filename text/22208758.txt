We have previously reported on the effects of in utero exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) on thyroid function and growth hormone concentrations at birth and in two and five year-old children .
Herein , we present our most recent follow-up examination findings for the same cohort of children at eight-years of age .
A total of 56 children ( 23 boys , 33 girls ) were examined .
Bone age ( BA ) , hormone concentrations , and indicators of reproductive development including Tanner , breast , genital , and armpit stages were assessed .
Estradiol concentrations were significantly lower in children exposed to higher levels than median of PCDD/Fs+PCBs TEQ compared to the children exposed to levels lesser than median ( P=0.003 ) .
Girls exposed to higher levels than median of indicator PCBs had a significantly greater proportion in genital stage 1 and shorter fundi and uteri lengths , as compared to those exposed to low levels ( P=0.025 and P<0.05 , respectively ) .
There was a significant negative relationship between estradiol concentrations and PCDD/Fs+PCB exposure level ( P=0.005 ) .
After adjusting for BA , there was a significant association between fundus length and indicator PCB exposure level ( P=0.034 ) .
Exposure to both high levels of \u03a3PCDD/Fs+PCBs TEQ and high levels of total PCBs was associated with decreased fundus length ( P=0.016 ) and uterus length ( P=0.016 ) .
In utero exposure to high levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs may result in lower estradiol concentrations in eight year-old children and impaired reproductive development in girls .
