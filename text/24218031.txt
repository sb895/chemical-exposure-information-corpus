Building on a unique exposure assessment project in New York , New York , we examined the relationship of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm and nitrogen dioxide with birth weight , restricting the population to term births to nonsmokers , along with other restrictions , to isolate the potential impact of air pollution on growth .
We included 252,967 births in 2008-2010 identified in vital records , and we assigned exposure at the residential location by using validated models that accounted for spatial and temporal factors .
Estimates of association were adjusted for individual and contextual sociodemographic characteristics and season , using linear mixed models to quantify the predicted change in birth weight in grams related to increasing pollution levels .
Adjusted estimates for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm indicated that for each 10-Âµg/m(3) increase in exposure , birth weights declined by 18.4 , 10.5 , 29.7 , and 48.4 g for exposures in the first , second , and third trimesters and for the total pregnancy , respectively .
Adjusted estimates for nitrogen dioxide indicated that for each 10-ppb increase in exposure , birth weights declined by 14.2 , 15.9 , 18.0 , and 18.0 g for exposures in the first , second , and third trimesters and for the total pregnancy , respectively .
These results strongly support the association of urban air pollution exposure with reduced fetal growth .
