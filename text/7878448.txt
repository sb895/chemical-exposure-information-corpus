210Po and 210Pb concentrations in urine , hair and skin smear samples from individuals using phosphated fertilizers have been compared with a control group of occupationally unexposed individuals .
Urine and hair samples of the test group showed slightly higher concentrations of 210Po and 210Pb than those observed for the control group .
These concentrations remained , however , lower than those for uranium mine workers .
Skin smear values indicated contamination by direct contact with dust from fertilizers and this may contribute to skin cancer induction in this risk population .
