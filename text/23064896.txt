The extent to which smokeless tobacco endangers human health is an ongoing subject of debate .
In this study , concentrations of toxic metals , cadmium ( Cd ) , lead ( Pb ) , and nickel ( Ni ) , were measured in different snuff products ( dry brown and black and moist green and brown ) , available and consumed in Pakistan .
Concentrations of Cd , Pb , and Ni were determined in 23 samples of various brands of snuff by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry , after microwave-assisted acid digestion .
The reliability of methodology was assured by analyzing certified reference material .
The resulted data of toxic metals in different snuff products are comparable to the existing information with limited exceptions .
It was estimated that 10 g intake of different types of snuff could contribute 14-68 , 17-47 , and 20-73 % of the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake for Cd , Ni , and Pb , respectively .
