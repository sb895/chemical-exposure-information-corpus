BACKGROUND AND AIMS A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effect of arsenic ( As ) exposure from drinking water on respiratory symptoms using data from the Health Effects of Arsenic Exposure Longitudinal Study ( HEALS ) , a large prospective cohort study established in Ariahazar , Bangladesh in 2000-2002 .
A total of 7.31 , 9.95 and 2.03% of the 11 746 participants completing 4 years of active follow-up reported having a chronic cough , breathing problem or blood in their sputum , respectively , as assessed by trained physicians .
METHODS Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs for respiratory symptoms during the follow-up period in relation to levels of chronic As exposure assessed at baseline , adjusting for age , gender , smoking , body mass index , education and arsenic-related skin lesion status .
RESULTS Significant positive associations were found between As exposure and respiratory symptoms .
As compared with those with the lowest quintile of water As level ( <or=7 microg/l ) , the HRs for having respiratory symptoms were 1.27 ( 95% CI 1.09 to 1.48 ) , 1.39 ( 95% CI 1.19 to 1.63 ) , 1.43 ( 95% CI 1.23 to 1.68 ) and 1.43 ( 95% CI 1.22 to 1.68 ) for the second to fifth quintiles of baseline water As concentrations ( 7-40 , 40-90 , 90-178 and >178 microg/l ) , respectively .
Similarly , the corresponding HRs in relation to the second to fifth quintiles of urinary arsenic were 1.10 ( 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27 ) , 1.11 ( 95% CI 0.95 to 1.29 ) , 1.29 ( 95% CI 1.11 to 1.49 ) and 1.35 ( 95% CI 1.16 to 1.56 ) , respectively .
These associations did not differ appreciably by cigarette smoking status .
CONCLUSIONS This prospective cohort study found a dose-response relationship between As exposure and clinical symptoms of respiratory diseases in Bangladesh .
In particular , these adverse respiratory effects of As were clearly evident in the low to moderate dose range , suggesting that a large proportion of the country's population may be at risk of developing serious lung diseases in the future .
