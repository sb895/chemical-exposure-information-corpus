To study the relationship between chemical elements in soil and whole blood , and fluorosis induced by coal-fired pollution , ecological and case-control studies were carried out .
We determined the concentrations of 11 chemical elements and pH values in soil in two fluorosis-affected counties in Chongqing , China , and analyzed the correlation between these values and prevalence of dental fluorosis .
Ni , I , F , Hg , and pH values positively correlated with fluorosis prevalence ( P\u2009<\u20090.05 ) ; these soil parameters may be related to coal-fired pollution fluorosis .
Cu , Zn , Ca , Mg , and Fe concentrations in whole blood , and fluoride levels in urine of residents in epidemic and non-epidemic areas were determined .
Cu , Zn , Mg , and Fe levels of the children in the case group were lower than those of the children in the external control group ; urine fluoride level in the children in the case group was higher than that of the children in the internal and external control groups ( P\u2009<\u20090.05 ) .
The levels of Mg , Fe , and urine fluoride were higher in the case adult group than in the internal adult control group ( P\u2009<\u20090.05 ) .
Anti-fluoride elements were deficient in endemic areas .
