A survey was undertaken of PCB and PCDD/DF congeners in eggs and poultry meat from a smallholding close to a chemical waste incinerator , other sites in the surrounding district , and three rural locations .
The concentrations from the site close to the incinerator were appreciably greater than those found elsewhere , although the contrast was less marked for poultry meat than eggs .
All types of poultry produce displayed noticeable variations in congener composition when the samples were grouped according to geographical origin .
These results support the view that the environment in which poultry live does influence the PCB and PCDD/DF characteristics of their products .
Exposure calculations indicated that consumption of eggs from the site close to the incinerator would constitute a substantial proportion of recommended daily intakes for such contaminants and at the present time these products are not being eaten .
