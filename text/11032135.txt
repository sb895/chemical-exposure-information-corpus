The mercury content in hair , for exposed dental workers and unexposed groups of people living in Albania was studied .
The influence of factors such as age , sex , body weight , fish consumption in the diet , number of dental amalgam fillings and time exposed to mercury , was determined .
The mean value of mercury content in hair for the subjects under study ( 0.705 microg/g ) was found to be lower than the value referred from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) for people who do not consume fish with a high methylmercury content ( 1-2 microg/g ) .
A significant positive correlation of Hg content with the number of dental amalgam fillings , time under exposure and frequency of fish consumption in the diet was found .
These correlations became stronger when exposed and unexposed groups of people were evaluated separately .
