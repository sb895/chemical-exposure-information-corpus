BACKGROUND Environmental exposure to organophosphorus pesticides has been characterized in various populations , but interpretation of these data from a health risk perspective remains an issue .
The current paper proposes biological reference values to help interpret biomonitoring data related to an exposure to organophosphorus pesticides in children for which measurements of alkylphosphate metabolites are available .
METHODS Published models describing the kinetics of malathion and chlorpyrifos in humans were used to determine no-observed effect level - biomarker equivalents for methylphosphates and ethylphosphates , respectively .
These were expressed in the form of cumulative urinary amounts of alkylphosphates over specified time periods corresponding to an absorbed no-observed effect level dose ( derived from a published human exposure dose ) and assuming various plausible exposure scenarios .
Cumulative amounts of methylphosphate and ethylphosphate metabolites measured in the urine of a group of Quebec children were then compared to the proposed biological reference values .
RESULTS From a published no-observed effect level dose for malathion and chlorpyrifos , the model predicts corresponding oral biological reference values for methylphosphate and ethylphosphate derivatives of 106 and 52 nmol/kg of body weight , respectively , in 12-h nighttime urine collections , and dermal biological reference values of 40 and 32 nmol/kg of body weight .
Out of the 442 available urine samples , only one presented a methylphosphate excretion exceeding the biological reference value established on the basis of a dermal exposure scenario and none of the methylphosphate and ethylphosphate excretion values were above the obtained oral biological reference values , which reflect the main exposure route in children .
CONCLUSION This study is a first step towards the development of biological guidelines for organophophorus pesticides using a toxicokinetic modeling approach , which can be used to provide a health-based interpretation of biomonitoring data in the general population .
