To study the evolution of cytogenetic damage from past exposure to high concentrations of benzene and its health significance , chromosome aberrations ( CA ) in lymphocytes were reinvestigated after approximately 20 years in four subjects with past severe hemopathy and in seven controls studied in the late 1960s .
Increased chromosome-type aberrations were still present up to 30 years after benzene toxicity , but blood counts were normal .
The vital status at the end of 1993 was ascertained for 32 subjects with a history of benzene toxicity and for 31 controls studied for CA from 1965 to 1970 , who differed significantly for CA rates .
Of the 32 benzene-exposed subjects , 1 was lost to follow-up , 20 were still alive , and 11 had died at ages 36 to 83 , between 1 and 20 years after the last CA study .
Five deaths were from neoplasia ( acute erythroleukemia , brain tumor , cancer of lung , paranasal cavity , esophagus ) .
The decreased subjects had significantly higher rates of chromosome-type aberrations than those alive , and those who died of neoplasia had the highest rates of these aberrations in the last study before death or diagnosis of cancer .
Out of the 31 controls , 12 had died from 4 to 23 years after the CA study .
Three deaths were from neoplasia ( two lung cancer , one brain tumor ) .
Even if this is a small sample , the results suggest a higher risk of cancer for the benzene-exposed cohort , who had persistently high CA rates in lymphocytes .
