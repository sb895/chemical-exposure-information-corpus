To interpret the distribution of hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs ) in various organisms , we measured the concentrations and diastereomer and enantiomer profiles of HBCDs in 21 different species of limnic and marine cohorts from Tianjin , China .
The concentration ranges of HBCDs in limnic and marine organisms were 64.3-1111 ng g(-1) lw and 85.5-989 ng g(-1) lw , respectively .
Living habitat and feeding habits had important impacts on HBCD diastereomer distribution .
Most of the species appeared to preferentially select ( +)-\u03b1- , ( -)-\u03b2- and ( -)-\u03b3-HBCD .
There is a tendency that the total and \u03b1-HBCDs were magnified as trophic level increased with trophic magnification factors ( TMFs ) around 2 .
The concentrations of HBCDs in the limnic and marine fishes were highest in the liver , followed by the gill , skin , and muscle .
In terrestrial plants , the highest concentrations of HBCDs were observed in the leaf , followed by the root and the rhizosphere soil .
Plants showed enantioselectivity for HBCD enantiomers , which varied with plant species and organs ( leaf vs. root ) of the same plant .
Higher estimated daily intakes ( EDIs ) of HBCDs were observed from fish than from wheat .
