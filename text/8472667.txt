The Cama√ßari Petrochemical Complex ( CPC ) is the biggest and most important industrial complex of the northeastern region of Brazil .
At present , its 54 companies employ directly and indirectly about 50,000 people .
Used there as solvent and raw material , compounds such as benzene and its homologues n-hexane , haloalkanes , and some alcohols have as their prime targets the central and peripheral nervous systems .
Despite widespread use of these chemicals , the workers are little aware of their toxicity , and the evaluation of exposure to them has only recently become a worrisome issue .
This paper discusses the contamination of occupational environments in some industries of the CPC , as well as the neurobehavioral impairment that could be found among their workers .
