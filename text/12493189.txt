Both lead and cadmium exposures derive from natural sources and also from industrialisation and certain habits , such as cigarette smoking in the case of cadmium .
Some of these sources only affect human beings .
The aim of this study was to determine the levels of lead and cadmium in bone samples of 16 prehispanic inhabitants of Gran Canaria , 24 prehispanic domestic animals ( sheep , goat and pigs ) from this island , 8 modern individuals , and 13 modern domestic animals .
We found that modern individuals showed higher bone Cd values ( mean=516.7+/-352.49 microg/kg , range=167.20-1125 microg/kg ) than prehistoric ones ( mean=85.13+/-128.96 microcg/kg , range=2.97-433 microg/kg ) .
Values of prehistoric individuals did not differ from those of the prehistoric animals ( mean=70.54+/-46.86 microg/kg , range=11.06-216.50 microg/kg ) , but were higher than those of the modern animals ( mean=7.31+/-10.35 microg/kg , range=0-35.62 microg/kg ) .
In the same way , modern individuals and modern animals showed approximately 7-fold higher bone Pb than ancient individuals and ancient animals , respectively .
Ancient animals showed significantly lower Pb values than all the other groups , whereas modern animals showed Pb values comparable to those of the ancient individuals .
A significant correlation was observed between bone Pb and Cd ( r=0.61 , P<0.001 ) .
Since bone cadmium accumulation leads to osteoporosis , we have also tested the relationship between histomorphometrically assessed trabecular bone mass and bone cadmium both in modern and ancient individuals .
No significant relationship was found between these two parameters .
