Arsenic concentrations were determined in 126 urine samples by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry .
Samples were mineralized with nitric acid in a thermostated mineralization block .
This technique was compared with a method that involves mineralization in a microwave digestion bomb .
A mean recovery percentage of 100.80 +/- 5.57% was obtained .
The relative standard deviation ranged from 1.7 to 10.52% .
It was found that subject sex and age did not affect urine As levels ( P > 0.05 ) .
The mean urine As levels in patients with hepatic injury ( 4.24 +/- 1.98 micrograms/l ) , diabetes ( 3.44 +/- 2.36 micrograms/l ) and myocardial infarction ( 3.64 +/- 1.85 micrograms/l ) were not statistically different ( P > 0.05 ) to that found in the control group ( healthy subjects ) ( 3.68 +/- 2.27 micrograms/l ) .
This result could be related to the fact that the regulation of As in the human organism is independent of these diseases .
Measured As concentrations in the eight basic health zones of the study area were not statistically different ( P > 0.01 ) .
This fact demonstrates the existence of a similarly low environmental As distribution in coastal and mountainous zones .
