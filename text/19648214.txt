In the gold ornaments manufacturing cottage industries , the gold metal grain dust waste particles are recovered from mercury ( Hg ) amalgam .
The results on air samples from these industries during the recovery process have shown a high prevalence of Hg vapor ( 42.7 mg/m(3) ) .
The blood concentration of Hg is elevated ( 79.1 microg/L ) among workers when their blood samples are tested .
The Hg toxicity is reflected in the reduction of glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity in RBC ( 49.317 mg/L of RBC ) when compared with the data from control subjects ( 68.536 mg/L of RBC ) .
These values are statistically significant .
This would suggest that the Hg poisoning in goldsmiths is due to exposure .
The results are discussed with relation to preventive measures .
