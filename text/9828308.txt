In 1993 , 30 individual human milk samples were collected in Murmansk and Monchegorsk , and analysed for 23 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners , PCBs ( IUPAC nos. ) 28 , 52 , 66 , 74 , 99 , 101 , 105 , 110 , 114 , 118 , 128 , 138 , 141 , 149 , 153 , 156 , 157 , 170 , 180 , 187 , 194 , 206 , and 209 .
In addition , the following organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) : hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , the alpha- , beta- , gamma-isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) , the chlordanes : oxychlordane , trans-chlordane , cis-chlordane , trans-nonachlor , and cis-nonachlor , and the DDT-compounds : pp-DDE , pp-DDD , op-DDT and pp-DDT were detected .
From each city , a pooled sample was made and analysed for non-ortho PCBs , dibenzodioxins ( PCDDs ) and dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) .
In addition one individual sample from Monchegorsk was analysed for PCDDs/PCDFs because of the very high levels of PCBs in this sample .
High levels of pp-DDE and beta-HCH were found in Murmansk and Monchegorsk ( in parenthesis ) with mean levels of 1269 , ( 892 ) and 853 , ( 739 ) micrograms/kg milk fat respectively .
Highest individual levels of pp-DDE ( 2816 micrograms/kg milk fat ) and beta-HCH ( 1988 micrograms/kg milk fat ) were found in Murmansk .
Significant differences were found between the levels of gamma-HCH , cis-chlordane , trans-nonachlor , cis-nonachlor , pp-DDE , and the PCBs 28 , 52 , 74 , 66 , 110 , 118 , 105 , 128 , 206 , and 209 , between the two areas .
No geographic differences in the concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs and non-ortho PCBs in the sample pools from the two Russian areas were observed .
