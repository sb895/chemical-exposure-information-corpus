Methylmercury ( MeHg ) is one of the most risky substances to affect humans through fish consumption , and the fetus is known to be in the most susceptible group .
Our objective in this study is to examine the relationships of total mercury ( THg ) and MeHg concentrations between umbilical cord tissue and other tissues as biomarkers of fetal exposure to MeHg in the Japanese population .
In total , 116 paired samples were collected in three Japanese districts , the Tsushima Islands , Fukuoka City , and Katsushika ward of metropolitan Tokyo .
THg was measured for hair and THg and MeHg were measured in cord tissues , maternal blood , and cord blood .
The relationships among tissues in Hg concentrations were similar among districts .
Therefore , we analyzed the relationships using all the samples .
More than 90% of Hg in cord tissue , cord blood , and maternal blood was MeHg .
THg and MeHg in cord blood was about two times higher than in maternal blood .
A strong correlation was found between THg and MeHg in cord tissue .
The cord tissue THg and MeHg showed a strong correlation with cord blood Hg , which is recognized as the best biomarker for fetal exposure to MeHg .
The findings of this study indicate the significance of cord tissue THg and MeHg as biomarkers for fetal exposure to MeHg at parturition .
