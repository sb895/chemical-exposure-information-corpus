Arsenic level of hair samples of apparently healthy Egyptian was measured by means of hydride atomic absorption spectrophotometery .
It ranged between 0.04 and 1.04 mg As/kg hair , about 55% of the analysed hair samples were within the range of allowable values ( 0.08-0.25 mg As/kg hair ) , but 45% were not .
There were no considerable sex-related differences ( 0.303 and 0.292 mg As/kg hair for males and females , respectively ) .
Different educational levels did not influence it either , when the effect of the age had been excluded .
Children and adolescents proved to be more susceptible to arsenic as their mean levels ( 0.353 microg/g ) , and were significantly higher than those in the adults ( 0.233 microg/g ) .
Smoking and some dietary habits had an important role in the elevation of arsenic levels among the nonoccupational Egyptian population : 60% of smokers and 66.7% of indoor passive smokers had arsenic levels >0.25 mg As/kg hair .
Arsenic levels were also dependent on the kind of smoking , as hair arsenic of the subject smoking molasses tobacco was found to be significantly higher than that of cigarette smokers ( 0.459 and 0.209 mg As/kg hair , respectively ) .
The frequency of meat and fish consumption per week was also found to be positively , significantly correlated with arsenic levels .
On the other hand , the frequency of consumption of fruits , fresh and cooked vegetables , milk and milk products per week beneficially influenced the arsenic level of the hair samples examined .
Arsenic content of the consumed water in Egypt was 0.001 mg/l , which is below the maximum drinking water level allowed by World Health Organisation ( WHO ) .
Therefore , the arsenic content of domestic tap water hardly contributed to the arsenic exposure of the Egyptian population in the regions of the study .
It is likely that exposure routes by smoking , fish and animal protein consumption are the principal cause of arsenic accumulation in the general Egyptian population .
