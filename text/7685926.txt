This paper presents a model for car exhaust exposure calculations , which improves the air pollution exposure estimates necessary to study relationships between health and air pollution .
The model enables calculation of hour-by-hour air pollution concentrations at receptor points in an area .
Combined with a diary method , in which participants in the study give data on their movement in the area , the model enables personal air pollution exposure values to be calculated .
The paper shows examples of comparison between measured and calculated exposure .
