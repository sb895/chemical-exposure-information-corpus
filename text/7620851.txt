The inhabitants living in the neighbourhood of a deserted mercury-contaminated industrial site are subjected to an age-group differentiated mercury exposure assessment based on a scenario-linked calculation .
Analytical input data for the calculation procedure are provided for from soil , air and plants in a large number .
The most sensitive group are small children being mainly exposed by soil ingestion which makes up nearly 80% of the ADI , followed by inhalation of mercury contaminated indoor air .
On the other hand , inhalation of indoor air has a predominant impact on youth and adults .
