Daily intakes of 17 metals ( boron , aluminium , chromium , manganese , nickel , copper , zinc , arsenic , selenium , molybdenum , cadmium , antimony , lead , uranium , magnesium , calcium , and iron ) via drinking water and total diet were investigated in six cities in Japan .
The daily metal intakes were estimated and compared with tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) values proposed by the WHO or Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives for toxic metals and with recommended dietary allowances ( RDAs ) or adequate intake ( AI ) values proposed for essential metals by the Japanese Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare .
Among the 13 toxic metals , mean dietary intakes of 10 ( except arsenic , selenium , and molybdenum ) were less than 50% of TDI , suggesting that for these 10 metals the allocation of intake to drinking water in establishing guidelines or standards could possibly be increased from the normal allocation of 10-20% of TDI .
For the 13 toxic metals , the contribution of drinking water to TDI was 2% or less in all six cities .
Mean dietary intakes of the essential elements magnesium , calcium , and iron were less than the RDA or AI values .
Drinking water did not contribute much to essential metal intake , accounting for less than 10% of RDA or AI .
