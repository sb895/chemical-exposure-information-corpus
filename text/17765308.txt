Phthalates are widely used in industry and consumer products .
Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) and di-n-butylphthalate ( DBP ) show the greatest potency of reproductive toxicants among phthalates .
The purposes of this study are to examine the migration level of phthalate from PVC films by simulating food handling and to reveal the body burden of phthalate for Taiwanese .
In order to estimate a worst-case of phthalate migration , food was covered with polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) films and then microwave heated .
Results show that DEHP level in food increased significantly after heating for 3 min .
Under the heating condition , the calculated intake of phthalate and the percentage of the tolerable daily intake ( TDI , based on body weight of 60 kg ) from eating one 400-g meal were 1705.6 microg and 92.2% for DEHP .
Determination of urinary metabolites from 60 subjects reveals more than 90% of samples were detectable for mono-methyl phthalate ( MMP ) , mono-butyl phthalate ( MBP ) and mono-ethylhexyl phthalate ( MEHP ) .
Notably , the median value of estimated daily intake of DEHP had reached 91.6% of TDI established by the European Union Scientific Committee for Toxicity , Ecotoxicity and the Environment ( CSTEE ) ( 1998 ) .
Thirty-seven percent of the study population exceeded the TDI and 85% exceeded the reference dose ( RfD ) of the US EPA .
We conclude that the body burden of DEHP for Taiwanese reflects the intensives use of plastic materials in the region .
The regulation of PVC for food preparation is necessary .
