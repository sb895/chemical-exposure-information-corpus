The aim of this study was to measure the mercury ( Hg ) contents of three marine fish and common seafood species ( Diplodus annularis , Sarpa salpa and Sepia officinalis ) at two sampling sites in the gulf of Gabes , i.e .
Sidi Mansour ( polluted site ) and Kerkennah ( control site ) .
These species are frequently consumed by the population living at the Sfax coasts of Tunisia , particularly by the families of fisherman .
Additionally , the hair mercury levels of 55 volunteers ( 28 women , 27 men ) were analysed and the daily total mercury intake through the fish and seafood diet was estimated .
The key findings were : ( 1 ) the mercury contents of the examined fish and seafood species frequently exceeded the regulatory guideline value of 0.5 mg/kg , ( 2 ) no site-specific differences in hair mercury contents were found , ( 3 ) fish and seafood consumption is probably the major contributor of mercury exposure in this population , ( 4 ) the daily mercury intake through frequent consumption of D. annularis exceeds the US EPA reference dose .
Further studies are necessary to evaluate the health risks associated with such high mercury exposure levels in order to allow optimal counseling and therapy of the concerned population and to avoid future impairment of human health , particularly children's health .
