Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) including perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) have been used in a wide range of industrial and consumer applications since 1960s .
The previous studies have reported the occurrences of PFOS and PFOA in human blood and serum from various countries .
In this study , 141 human whole blood samples collected from four cities around Bohai Sea in China including Qinhuangdao , Tangshan , Weihai , and Zouping were analyzed for PFCs .
The highest median concentration of total PFCs was found in whole blood samples from Tangshan ( 14.01 ng mL(-1) ) .
The median concentration of total PFCs in samples from Zouping ( 7.28 ng mL(-1) ) was the lowest , but the median concentration of PFOA ( 3.26 ng mL(-1) ) was the highest among four cities and the percentage proportion of PFOA ( 45% ) was higher than that of PFOS ( 30% ) .
Based on the different profiles of PFCs between coastal cities , it was suggested that there might be different human exposure sources and pathways of PFCs around Bohai Sea .
