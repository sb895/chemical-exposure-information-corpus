The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and biphenyls ( PCBs ) in samples from 14 fish and seafood species widely consumed by the population of Catalonia , Spain , were measured .
These samples were randomly purchased independently of their geographical origin .
The intake of PCDD/Fs and PCBs through consumption of these species was also estimated for various age and sex groups of this population .
The highest and lowest levels of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs ( DL-PCBs ) were found in red mullet and shrimp , respectively .
For a standard adult man ( 70 kg body weight ) , the intake of PCDD/Fs plus DL-PCBs through consumption of fish and other seafood was estimated to be 38.0 pg WHO-TEQ/day .
Tuna , hake , and sardine were the species with the highest contribution to this intake .
The results of this study indicate that , in general terms , the dietary habits of the population of Catalonia ( Spain ) regarding fish and seafood consumption do not contribute remarkably to increase PCDD/F and DL-PCB intake .
