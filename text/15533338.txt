The Wisconsin Division of Public Health and the State of Maine Bureau of Health collaborated on a 12 state mercury awareness project .
The primary goals of this initiative were to evaluate mercury sport fishing advisory awareness among women of childbearing age and assess the methylmercury exposure among this subpopulation .
The project , which was conducted between December 1998 and December 1999 , involved a randomized telephone survey of 3015 women of childbearing age and hair mercury analyses for a subset of 414 women .
While 92% of these women had consumed fish or shellfish during the past year , less than one third ( 29% ) of them had eaten any sport-caught fish .
More than two thirds of the women who consumed sportfish were not aware that their state had issued fish consumption guidelines to protect against methylmercury exposure .
Hair mercury levels ranged from 0.005 to 4.62 ppm and were positively correlated with recent fish consumption rates ( P<0.0001 ) .
Women who ate sport-caught fish did not have significantly higher hair mercury levels than others ( mean 0.51 vs. 0.48 ppm ) .
Among women who ate sportfish , advisory awareness had no effect on their mercury exposure .
Demographic indicators associated with higher hair mercury levels included residence in northeastern USA , marital status of married , college education , annual household income greater than $75,000 , and Asian race .
