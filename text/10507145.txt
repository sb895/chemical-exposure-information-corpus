The indoor exposure of 381 women ( 52-59 years old ) to lead and cadmium was assessed by measuring the levels of the contaminants in sedimented house dust .
The study was conducted in the areas surrounding the towns of Hettstedt , a region of mining and smelting of non-ferrous ores , of Bitterfeld , a centre of chemical production and coal mining , and of Zerbst , a primarily agricultural area .
Factors that were significantly associated with lead and cadmium surface loading rates included the city area of residence , urban environment of dwelling , ventilation behaviour , type of heating , year of construction of building and crowding in the sampling room .
In metal-contaminated areas , the transport of heavy metals into the home from external sources and their subsequent resuspension into the air due to normal household activities are significant factors in the exposure to heavy metals , whereas in unpolluted areas indoor sources play the major role .
