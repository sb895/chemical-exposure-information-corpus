A study was conducted to examine human exposure to mercury through dietary mercury intake in a population living in an industrially non-polluted area of the Adriatic Sea .
The results have shown that approximately 20% of the subjects had a weekly dietary mercury intake above the provisional tolerable weekly intake ( PTWI ) , primarily those consuming fish and other seafood > 6 times/week .
The estimated seafood consumption corresponding to a mean intake of PTWI of 300 micrograms total mercury was 1559 g , and 1365 g for a PTWI of 200 micrograms methylmercury .
However , the total mercury content in hair in individuals consuming total mercury above the PTWI was in the range of 1.3-12.9 micrograms/g , whereas the methylmercury content in hair in subjects consuming methylmercury above the PTWI was between 1.1-10.8 micrograms .
Thus , the mercury content in hair did not reach the critical level at which toxic effects of mercury could be expected .
The results , particularly those related to methylmercury exposure , did not differ significantly from data reported earlier from an industrially polluted area , thus indicating that the mercury content of fish and consequent human exposure to mercury reflects primarily the general ecological characteristics of the Adriatic , rather than the impact upon a specific local pollution .
