In the present study , human milk was sampled in October 2006 from Nour and Noushahr cities and their countryside on the Southern Coast of Caspian Sea , Iran .
They were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides , such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) and its metabolites , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , alpha , beta and gamma-hexachlorocycloexane ( HCH ) isomers and six PCBs congeners ( IUPAC Nos. 28 , 52 , 101 , 138 , 153 and 180 ) .
Average concentrations of HCHs , DDTs , PCBs and HCB were 3780 , 2554 , 1560 and 930 ng g(-1) lipid wt , respectively .
There was no significant difference between the concentrations of investigated pollutants between the two cities and their countryside .
No significant differences in OCPs and PCBs were found between primiparous and multiparous mothers .
There was no correlation between levels of OCPs and PCBs in human milk and the age of mothers .
There was a significant difference in the organochlorine levels , including DDTs , between mothers who have eaten fish once a week and those who consumed fish more than once ( p>0.05 ) .
An analysis of the infant exposure to OCPs and PCBs via breast milk indicated that the daily intake rates for most of the mothers were above the guideline proposed by Health Canada which is definitely caused on children health for concern .
