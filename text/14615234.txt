We studied a population-based sample of 143 residents of a community in which the municipal water supply had been contaminated with trichloroethylene ( TCE ) and related chemicals from several adjacent hazardous waste sites between 1981 and 1986 .
A hydraulic simulation model was used in conjunction with a geographic information system ( GIS ) to estimate residential water supply exposures to TCE ; 80% of the participants had potential TCE exposure exceeding the maximum contaminant level ( 5 ppb ) .
The Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery ( NCTB ) , tests of visual contrast sensitivity , and the profile of mood states ( POMS ) were administered approximately 6 years following peak concentrations of TCE in municipal drinking water .
Multivariate analysis of variance adjusted for potential confounders was used to compare mean test scores of residents classified by estimated TCE exposure ( < or =5 , >5-10 , >10-15 , >15 ppb ) .
TCE exposure >15 ppb was associated with poorer performance on the digit symbol , contrast sensitivity C test , and contrast sensitivity D test and higher mean scores for confusion , depression , and tension .
We found evidence of a strong interaction between exposure to TCE and alcohol consumption ; the associations for the NCTB and POMS among persons in the high-exposure group who also consumed alcohol were stronger and were statistically significant for the Benton , digit symbol , digit span , and simple reaction time tests , as well as for confusion , depression , and tension .
This study adds to the evidence that long-term exposure to low concentrations of TCE is associated with neurobehavioral deficits and demonstrates the usefulness of GIS-based modeling in exposure assessment .
