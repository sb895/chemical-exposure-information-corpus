Zhoushan Island is situated in the coast of the East China Sea .
In order to assess the potential health risks associated with dietary consumption of mercury , hair samples from 59 piscatorial households , thirteen species of fish , crops and poultry samples were collected from the fishing villagers of Zhoushan .
Total mercury ( T-Hg ) and methylmercury ( MeHg ) concentrations in the fathers ' hair ( mean , 5.7 and 3.8 microg/g ) were approximately 2.5 and 2.1 times greater and 2.6 and 2.0 times higher than those of their wives ( 2.3 and 1.8 microg/g ) and their children ( 2.2 and 1.7 microg/g ) , respectively .
However , the mean quantity of the fish consumed by the fathers was 2.5 and 2.4 times higher than those of the mothers and children , implying that there was a wide variation in hair Hg concentrations between the fathers and the mothers and children of the same household , which was probably related to the quantity , frequency and type of fish consumed .
The average T-Hg and MeHg concentrations in all species of fish were 0.26 and 0.18 microg/g , respectively .
Approximately , 15% and 19% of the samples showed T-Hg and MeHg levels which exceeded the limit established by the Chinese National Standard Agency ( CNSA ) ( 0.3 and 0.2 microg/g ) , respectively .
However , T-Hg and MeHg levels in crops , poultry , milk , drinking water , food oil and salt samples were all below the corresponding CNSA limit .
The estimated total daily dietary intakes of T-Hg and MeHg via different food types showed that fish intake was the major source ( >85% ) of Hg exposure .
The consumption advisories for the total quantity of thirteen species of fish were 69.3 , 58.7 and 15.0 g per day for fathers , mothers and children , respectively .
