A cross-sectional case-control study was carried out to evaluate the concentrations of metallic elements in the hair of 44 children with diagnosis of autism and 61 age-balanced controls .
Unadjusted comparisons showed higher concentrations of molybdenum , lithium and selenium in autistic children .
Logistic regression analysis confirmed the role of risk factor for male gender and showed a slight association with molybdenum concentrations .
Unconventional chelation and vitamin-mineral supplementation were ineffective on elemental hair concentrations .
A meta-analysis including the present and previous similar studies excluded any association of autism with hair concentrations of mercury , cadmium , selenium , lithium and copper .
A slight association was found for lead only , but it was very weak , as strictly dependent on the worst data from one study .
