This paper gives an overview of the development of the environmental or background exposure of humans to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) in Germany .
To determine the background exposure , adipose tissue , human milk , or blood can be used .
The good comparability of the matrices analyzed is demonstrated .
The daily consumption of low-level contaminated food , mainly of animal origin , leads to the accumulation of PCDDs/PCDFs in the human adipose reservoir .
The influence of factors such as various eating habits , severe weight loss , age , and nursing ( women only ) on the human body burden is discussed .
Because of decreasing emission of PCDDs/PCDFs into the environment , a decline of these components in humans could be observed over a time span of 10 years .
