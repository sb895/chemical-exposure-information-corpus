This study was a longitudinal assessment of mercury exposure in schoolchildren in an urban area of the Brazilian Amazon .
The study population consisted of 90 children whose exposure levels were assessed by testing mercury levels in the umbilical cord blood and mothers ' blood samples in 2000-2001 , and in the children's hair and blood samples .
The study also used a questionnaire on demographic and socioeconomic data , fish consumption , and self-reported disease history .
Mean mercury level in hair in 2010 was approximately 1 µg/g , ranging up to 8.22 µg/g , similar to 2004 and 2006 .
These figures can be explained by low fish consumption .
Mean blood mercury levels at birth exceeded 10 µg/L , ranging up to nearly 60 µg/L , which indicates mercury transfer across the placenta .
There was a significant increase in blood mercury from 2004 to 2006 ( p < 0.001 ) , suggesting exposure through air pollution .
The main exposure to mercury was during pregnancy .
