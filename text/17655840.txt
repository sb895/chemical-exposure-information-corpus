Exposure to hazardous Hg can adversely affect children's neurodevelopment .
However , few data are available on either Hg levels in neonates and their mothers or the impact of prenatal exposure to Hg on neonates ' neurobehavioral development in the Chinese population .
Therefore , this study examined Hg levels in neonates and their mothers and the relationship between prenatal exposure to Hg and neonates ' neurobehavioral development in Zhoushan City , Zhejiang Province , China .
Between August and October 2004 , 417 women who delivered their babies at Zhoushan Women's and Children's Health Hospital , an island city in east China were invited to take part in this study .
A total of 408 complete questionnaires , 405 maternal hair samples , and 406 umbilical cord samples were collected .
Neonatal behavioral neurological assessments ( NBNA ) were conducted for 384 neonates .
The geometric mean ( GM ) of Hg level in cord blood was 5.58 microg/L ( interquartile range : 3.96-7.82 microg/L ) , and the GM of maternal hair Hg level was 1246.56 microg/kg ( interquartile range : 927.34-1684.67 microg/kg ) , a level much lower than other reported fish-eating populations , indicating Hg exposure in Zhoushan city is generally below those considered hazardous .
However , according to the reference dose of Hg levels ( RfD 5.8 microg/L ) derived by EPA , 69.9% of newborns had levels at or above the RfD , an estimated level assumed to be without appreciable harm .
There was a strong correlation between maternal hair and cord blood Hg levels ( r = 0.82 , P < 0.01 ) .
Frequency of fish consumption was associated with hair Hg ( r = 0.48 , P < 0.01 ) and cord blood Hg levels ( r = 0.54 , P < 0.01 ) .
Increased prenatal Hg exposure was associated with decreased behavioral ability for males ( OR = 1.235 , 95%CI of OR = 1.078-1.414 , P < 0.001 ) , but not for females .
Our results provide some support for the hypothesis that there is neurodevelopmental risk for males from prenatal MeHg exposure resulting from fish consumption .
But the findings of this study may be due to chance , and long-term follow-up research is needed to evaluate cumulative effects of exposure to mercury .
