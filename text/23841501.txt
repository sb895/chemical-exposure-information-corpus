To investigate the hypothesis that general environmental arsenic ( As ) exposure can impair male fertility , we designed a case-control study examining possible correlations between the concentrations of different As species in urine [ controls ( n = 151 ) vs cases ( n = 140) ] , urinary metabolic biomarkers [ controls ( n = 158 ) vs cases ( n = 135) ] , and infertility characterized by poor semen quality .
Regional participants were recruited sequentially from the affiliated hospitals of Nanjing Medical University .
Elevated inorganic arsenate ( Asi(V) ) exposure was associated with infertility : in comparison with the first quartile , subjects with Asi(V) levels above the median were more likely to exhibit male idiopathic infertility with increasing adjusted odds ratios ( AOR ) of 4.9 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.8-13.6 ] and 13.6 ( 95% CI , 4.8-38.6 ) at the third and fourth quartiles ( P = 0.000 for trend ) , respectively .
Other As species did not exhibit a significant dose-dependent correlation with infertility risk .
Levels of urinary biomarkers correlated with both male infertility and Asi(V) concentrations [ controls ( n = 145 ) vs cases ( n = 123) ] ; the latter correlation was independent of disease .
These included acylcarnitines , aspartic acid , and hydroxyestrone , which were negatively associated with infertility , and uridine and methylxanthine , which were positively associated .
In conclusion , for the first time we show that elevated urinary concentrations of Asi(V) from general As exposure are significantly associated with male infertility , and As species may exert toxicity via oxidative stress and sexual hormone disrupting mechanisms , as indicated by related biomarkers .
