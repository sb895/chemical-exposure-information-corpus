Although the accumulation of arsenic ( As ) in human blood is linked with some diseases and with occupational exposure , there are few reports on speciation of As in blood .
On the basis of our earlier article , elevated level of arsenicals in human urine and blood were found in the ex-exposed population via As-containing drinking water .
The aim of the present study was to get an insight on impact of As in foodstuffs on the people living in the As-affected areas .
Moreover , speciation of arsenicals in urine , and water-samples found in arsenobetaine ( AsB ) .
Since sampling population ( n=25 ) was not taking any seafood , As in foodstuffs was thought to be the prime source for this discrepancy .
So , speciation of methanol extract of freeze-dried red blood cells ( RBCs ) and foodstuffs , and trichloro acetic acid ( TCA ) treated plasma by high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometer ( HPLC-ICP MS ) collected from the study population ( n=33 ) was carried out to support our hypothesis .
Results showed that urine contained AsB ( 1.7% ) , arsenite ( iAs(III) ) ( 14.3 ) , arsenate ( iAs(V) ) ( 4.9 ) , monomethylarsonous acid ( MMA(III) ) ( 0.64 ) , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA(V) ) ( 13.6 ) , dimethylarsinous acid ( DMA(III) ) ( 7.7 ) , and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA(V) ) ( 65.4 ) .
Blood contained 21.3 microg L(- 1 ) ( mean ) As and of which 27.3% was in plasma and 72.7% in RBCs .
RBCs contained AsB ( 21.6% ) and DMA(V) ( 78.4 ) and blood plasma contained AsB ( 12.4% ) , iAs(III) ( 25.9 ) , MMA(V) ( 30.3 ) , and DMA(V) ( 31.4 ) .
Furthermore , speciation of As in foodstuffs showed that most of them contained AsB ( 3.54-25.81 microg kg(- 1) ) ( 25.81-312.44 microg kg(- 1) ) along with iAs(III) ( 9.62-194.93 ) , iAs(V) ( 17.63-78.33 ) , MMA(V) ( 9.47-73.22 ) and DMA(V) ( 13.43-101.15 ) that supported the presence of AsB and elevated As in urine and blood samples of the present study group .
Inorganic As ( iAs ) predominates in rice ( 67.17-86.62% ) and in spices ( 40-90.35% ) , respectively over organic As .
So , As in the food chain is a real threat to human health .
