We recently reported associations between urinary 1-naphthol ( 1N ) levels and several intermediate measures of male reproductive health , namely sperm motility , serum testosterone levels , and sperm DNA damage .
However , because 1N is a major urinary metabolite of both naphthalene and the insecticide carbaryl , exposure misclassification stemming from differences in exposure source was probable and interpretation of the results was limited .
As naphthalene , but not carbaryl , is also metabolized to 2-naphthol ( 2N ) , the relationship of urinary 1N to 2N within an individual may give information about source of 1N .
Utilizing data from two previous studies that measured both 1N and 2N in urine of men exposed to either carbaryl or naphthalene , the present study employed several methods to differentiate urinary 1N arising from exposures to carbaryl and naphthalene among men in the reproductive health study .
When re-evaluating the reproductive health data , techniques for identifying 1N source involved exploring interaction terms , stratifying the data set based on 1N/2N ratios , and performing an exposure calibration using a linear 1N to 2N relationship from a study of workers exposed to naphthalene in jet fuel .
Despite some inconsistencies between the methods used to distinguish 1N source , we found that 1N from carbaryl exposure is likely responsible for the previously observed association between 1N and sperm motility , whereas 1N from naphthalene exposure is likely accountable for the association between 1N and sperm DNA damage .
We demonstrate that studies of health effects associated with carbaryl should utilize a 1N/2N ratio to identify subgroups in which carbaryl is the primary source of 1N .
Conversely , studies of naphthalene-related outcomes may utilize 2N levels to estimate exposure .
