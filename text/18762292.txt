A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the influence of sportfish consumption on body burden of nine polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE ) congeners in 36 New York State ( NYS ) anglers .
Participating anglers who had previously reported consuming sportfish from Lake Ontario and its tributaries were found to have significantly higher blood plasma levels of BDE-28 , BDE-47 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , and the sum of measured PBDE congeners ( SigmaPBDE ) , than anglers who had previously reported no consumption of sportfish from these waters .
Bivariate analysis was used to evaluate potential dietary predictors of PBDE plasma levels , including indicators of consumption of sportfish , as well as commercial fish , wild waterfowl , dairy products , and beef .
The number of years of reported consumption of Lake Ontario sportfish between 1980 and 1990 was found to be correlated with plasma levels of BDE-47 , BDE-85 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-153 , BDE-154 , and SigmaPBDE .
The number of meals , eaten in the year prior to study participation , of Lake Ontario sportfish species known to have high levels of other persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) was correlated with plasma levels of BDE-28 , BDE-47 , BDE-85 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-154 , and SigmaPBDE .
Multiple linear regression revealed that the number of years consuming Lake Ontario sportfish between 1980 and 1990 , after adjusting for plasma lipids , was a weak , but statistically significant , predictor of SigmaPBDE plasma levels ( beta=0.130 , 95% CI : 0.007-0.254 ) .
These results suggest that sportfish consumption can contribute measurably to PBDE body burden in NYS anglers , although there are likely to be additional , more significant , sources of exposure .
