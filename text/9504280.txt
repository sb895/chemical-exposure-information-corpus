Trihalomethanes ( chloroform , bromoform , bromodichloromethane , and chlorodibromomethane ) are common contaminants of chlorinated drinking water .
Although animal data indicate that these compounds may be reproductive toxicants , little information exists on their relation to spontaneous abortion in humans .
We examined exposure to trihalomethanes and spontaneous abortion in a prospective study of 5,144 pregnant women in a prepaid health plan .
Seventy-eight drinking water utilities provided concurrent trihalomethane sampling data .
We calculated total trihalomethane levels by averaging all measurements taken by the subject's utility during her first trimester .
We calculated exposures to individual trihalomethanes in an analogous manner .
Women who drank > or = 5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing > or = 75 micrograms per liter total trihalomethanes had an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of 1.8 for spontaneous abortion [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.1-3.0 ] .
Of the four individual trihalomethanes , only high bromodichloromethane exposure ( consumption of > or = 5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing > or = 18 micrograms per liter bromodichloromethane ) was associated with spontaneous abortion both alone ( adjusted OR = 2.0 ; 95% CI = 1.2-3.5 ) and after adjustment for the other trihalomethanes ( adjusted OR = 3.0 ; 95% CI = 1.4-6.6 ) .
