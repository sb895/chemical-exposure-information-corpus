Blood lead levels ( BPb ) and serum polychlorinated biphenyl levels ( PCB ) were obtained from 17 employees at two adjacent scrap metal dealers .
One facility was located outdoors , directly on top of soil known to be contaminated with lead and PCBs , and the other was located indoors with a concrete floor .
BPbs ranged from 4.0 to 39.8 microgram/dl ( mean 19.9 microgram/dl , geometric mean 17.5 microgram/dl ) and PCB levels ranged from <1 to 65.3 ppb ( mean 7.5 ppb ) .
There was no significant difference in either BPb or serum PCB between the two sites .
BPb was significantly correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked at work , and both BPb and serum PCB were significantly related to eating lunch outside the lunchroom , suggesting hand-to-mouth contact as a source of exposure .
The lack of difference in BPb between employees of the two scrap metal dealers suggests an ongoing source of lead exposure at the sites , other than the soil .
