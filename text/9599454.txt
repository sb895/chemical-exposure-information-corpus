This study reports the concentration levels of PCB , DDT , HCB and beta-HCH in the human milk of women living in northern Germany over a period of 12 years and determines factors that may influence these levels .
From 1986 to 1997 more than 3500 milk samples were analyzed for organochlorine compounds .
A questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding personal characteristics , life style factors and eating habits .
Descriptive statistics of concentration levels were computed to characterize the current extent of contamination .
To follow time trends across the years homogeneous subgroups were compared and multiple regression analyses were used to investigate associations between determining factors and specific contaminants .
Between summer 1995 and summer 1997 the median PCB concentration level was 0.502 mg/kg , the median DDT level 0.202 mg/kg , the median HCB level 0.065 mg/kg and the median beta-HCH level 0.036 mg/kg , all values expressed on a fat basis .
The median concentration levels decreased by 80-90% during the past 12 years and the median PCB levels by 60% .
The concentration levels of all substances were positively correlated with maternal age and negatively associated to parity , to the total period of breast-feeding and to a weight increase of mothers before and after delivery .
Post-pregnancy BMI was a significant predictor of the likelihood of having higher concentrations for DDT , HCB and beta-HCH and of having lower concentrations for PCB levels .
A balanced diet for at least 3 years was related to lower HCB and beta-HCH levels .
Women who ate more than 100 g of fish or more than 700 g of meat per week were more likely to have higher PCB and beta-HCH levels or higher HCB levels , respectively .
Higher HCB and beta-HCH concentration levels were associated with lower birth weights of female infants .
