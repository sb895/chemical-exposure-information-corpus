Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) are worldwide present in the environment and the general population .
Animal studies have shown developmental toxicity of these compounds .
To investigate the PFCs exposure of neonates from mother during gestation and lactation , we analyzed twelve PFCs in matched maternal serum , cord serum and breast milk samples collected from 50 pairs of women and their newborns between June and July 2009 in Jinhu , China .
Eight PFCs were detected in serum samples , and five of them were also detectable in breast milk .
A significant intercorrelation between PFCs concentrations in matched maternal serum , cord serum and breast milk was observed ( p<0.01 , r=0.435-0.911 ) .
The median partition ratio was from 0.39:1 ( PFDA ) to 1.74:1 ( PFTrDA ) for seven PFCs through the placenta , and was from 0.02:1 ( PFOS ) to 0.09:1 ( PFOA ) for five PFCs through the lactation .
A high transport efficiency of PFOA both through placental barrier and lactation was observed .
The postnatal exposure of PFCs through lactation was higher compared to prenatal exposure , especially for PFOA .
