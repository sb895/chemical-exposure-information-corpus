There are cadmium-polluted areas in Japan , where farmers may be at risk of renal dysfunction due to cadmium exposure through consumption of home-harvested rice .
The aims of this study were to investigate levels of cadmium exposure and accumulation and their renal effects in female farmers residing in cadmium-polluted areas , and to consider the relevance of age to the effects of cadmium .
We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1200 women ( 40-79years old ) without symptomatic disorders in two cadmium-polluted areas and one unpolluted area as a control .
Rice , blood , and urine samples were collected to measure the cadmium levels , together with urinary levels of \u03b11-microglobulin and \u03b22-microglobulin for renal tubular function .
Cadmium levels in rice were significantly higher in the polluted areas than control area .
Blood and urinary cadmium levels , along with urinary protein levels , were also significantly higher in the polluted areas , especially among the elder subjects .
There was one case of cadmium nephropathy in the polluted areas .
Age- and urinary cadmium-specific analysis for all the subjects showed a mild linear dose-response relationship between urinary cadmium and proteins in the younger women , and a steep progress of renal dysfunction over the threshold of urinary cadmium ( 10\u03bcg/g creatinine ) in the older women .
In conclusion , the aged women in the polluted areas showed high accumulation of cadmium and deterioration of renal function through consumption of rice .
Also , the aging process itself appeared to contribute to the different renal effects of cadmium observed in the elderly population .
