OBJECTIVE To reveal the inter-relationship between nutritional status and arsenic toxicity .
DESIGN Cross-sectional study .
SETTING A survey in an area of lowland Nepal , where a high prevalence of both skin manifestation and malnutrition was observed .
Daily arsenic intake was estimated by measuring the arsenic concentration and daily consumption of the drinking water .
PARTICIPANTS Adult villagers ( 248 men and 291 women ) .
About half were classified as " underweight " ( body mass index <18.5 ) , indicating poor nutritional status .
MAIN RESULTS Arsenic intake was negatively correlated with body mass index and substantially increased the prevalence of underweight individuals , among whom the prevalence of skin manifestations was 1.65-fold higher than normal weight individuals .
When exposure level was considered , the prevalence of skin symptoms was consistently higher in the underweight than in the normal group .
Although enhanced susceptibility in men was apparent by the increased prevalence of cutaneous symptoms , no sex difference was observed in the prevalence of underweight individuals related with exposure to arsenic .
CONCLUSIONS The present data suggested that exposure to arsenic is associated with an increased prevalence of underweight , a serious health problem in developing countries , which in turn is associated with increased skin manifestation of arsenic poisoning .
