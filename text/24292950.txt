The search for reliable biomarkers of human exposure to benzene and its derivatives is still subject of research .
Many of the proposed biomarkers have limitations ranging from the low sensitivity to the wide variability of results .
Thus , the aim of our study was to assess the frequencies of chromosomal abnormalities ( CA ) and sister chromatid exchanges ( SCE ) in workers of gas stations , with ( cases , n\u2009=\u200919 ) and without ( local controls , n\u2009=\u20096 ) risk of exposure to benzene and its derivatives , comparing them with the results from the general population ( external controls , n\u2009=\u200938 ) .
The blood dosages of benzene , toluene , and xylenes were measured in all participants .
Blood solvent levels were compared with the findings obtained in cytogenetic evaluation and a research protocol which included data of the workplace , lifestyle , and health of the individuals .
We did not detect the presence of benzene and its derivatives and did not find chromosomal damage that may be associated with the gas station activity in cases .
Moreover , although we found an association of increased SCE and the working time in the local controls , the values found for SCE are within normal limits .
Thus , our evaluation of SCE and CA reflected the levels of benzene and its derivatives observed in the blood .
We believe , therefore , that SCE and CA may actually constitute possible tests for the evaluation of these exposures .
However , we believe that further studies , including individuals at risk , are important to confirm this assertion .
