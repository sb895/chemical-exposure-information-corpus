The arsenic ( As ) content of coal relating with mineralization of gold in Southwest Guizhou Province , China is up to 35,000 ppm .
The coal is burned indoors in open pits for daily cooking and crop drying .
As a result , arsenic is precipitated and concentrated in corn ( 5-20 ppm ) , chili ( 100-800 ppm ) and other foods .
Arsenic concentrations in the drinking water of high-As coal areas are lower than 50 ppb .
The estimated main sources of As exposure in this area are from polluted food .
Approximately , 3000 arsenosis patients were found by 1998 , and more than 100,000 people from six counties were under the threat in China .
This paper presents the major ingestion pathway of this type arsenosis and relative geochemistry of high-As coal .
