Poor indoor air quality and epidemic carbon monoxide ( CO ) and nitrogen dioxide ( NO(2) ) poisonings due to exhaust emissions from ice resurfacers have been continuously reported from enclosed ice arenas for over 30 years .
The health risks in users of Finnish ice arenas were analysed in three ways : ( 1 ) evaluation of four cases of epidemic CO poisonings , ( 2 ) modelling the association between NO(2) exposure and respiratory symptoms among junior ice hockey players , and ( 3 ) estimation of the number of arena users at risk of breathing poor quality air due to non-compliance of ice arenas with recommended abatement measures .
The common causes for the CO poisonings involving over 300 subjects were large emissions from propane-fuelled ice resurfacer , small arena volume , negligible ventilation , and very recent opening of the arena .
Rhinitis ( prevalence 18.3% ) and cough ( 13.7% ) during or after training or game were significantly associated with the estimated personal NO(2) exposure of young hockey players ( n=793 ) to average concentrations ranging from 21 to 1176 microg/m(3) in their home arena .
During a 6-year follow-up of an intensive information campaign the portion of electric resurfacers increased from 9% to 27% , and that of emission control technology on propane-fuelled resurfacers increased from 13% to 84% .
The portion of inadequately ventilated arenas decreased from 34% to 25% .
However , 48% of the investigated Finnish ice arenas ( n=125 ) did not fully comply with the non-regulatory recommendations .
Consequently , 20000 daily users of ice arenas were estimated to remain in 2001 at risk of breathing poor quality air .
Modern small and inadequately ventilated ice arenas pose their users ( mostly children and young adults ) at risk of breathing poor quality air and suffering from acute adverse health effects .
Governmental regulations are needed worldwide to ensure safe sports in enclosed ice arenas .
