Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) is the most prominent perfluoroalkyl contaminant in humans and wildlife , but there is great uncertainty in exposure pathways , particularly with respect to the importance of PFOS-precursors ( PreFOS ) .
We explored the hypothesis that nonracemic proportions of chiral PFOS in serum are qualitative and semiquantitative biomarkers of human PreFOS exposure .
A new chiral HPLC-MS/MS method was developed for alpha-perfluoromethyl branched PFOS ( 1m-PFOS , typically 2-3% of total PFOS ) and applied to enantiomer fraction ( EF ) analysis in biological samples .
In blood and tissues of rodents exposed subchronically to electrochemical PFOS , 1m-PFOS was racemic ( EF = 0.485-0.511 ) and no evidence for enantioselective excretion was found in this model mammal. 1m-PFOS in serum of pregnant women , from Edmonton , was significantly nonracemic , with a mean EF ( ±standard deviation ) of 0.432 ± 0.009 , similar to pooled North American serum .
In a highly exposed Edmonton family ( mother , father , and 5 children ) living in a house where ScotchGard had been applied repeatedly to carpet and upholstery , EFs ranged from 0.35 to 0.43 , significantly more nonracemic than in pregnant women .
Semiquantitative estimates of % serum 1m-PFOS coming from 1m-PreFOS biotransformation in both subpopulations were in reasonable agreement with model predictions of human exposure to PFOS from PreFOS .
The data were overall suggestive that the measured nonracemic EFs were influenced by the relative extent of exposure to PreFOS .
The possibility of using 1m-PFOS EFs for assessing the relative contribution of 1m-PreFOS ( or PreFOS in general ) in biological samples requires further application before being fully validated , but could be a powerful tool for probing general sources of PFOS in environments where the importance of PreFOS is unknown .
