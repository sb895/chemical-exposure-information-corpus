Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs ) , tetrabromobisphenol-A ( TBBP-A ) , and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were measured in floor dust from U.K. child daycare center and primary school classrooms ( n = 43 , 36 for PCBs ) .
Concentrations of HBCDs exceeded significantly ( p < 0.05 ) those reported previously for U.K. houses and offices , while those of TBBP-A exceeded significantly those in U.K. cars and offices .
PCB concentrations were statistically indistinguishable from those in U.K. house dust but lower than in U.S. classroom dust , while BDEs 47 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 196 , 197 , 203 , and 209 in classrooms were significantly below concentrations in U.K. cars .
Exposure of young U.K. children via classroom dust exceeds that of U.K. adults via office dust for all contaminants monitored .
Overall dust exposure of young U.K. children was estimated including car , classroom , and house dust .
Exposure to TBBP-A was well below a U.K. health-based limit value ( HBLV ) .
Though no HBLVs exist for non-dioxin-like PCBs and HBCDs ; dust exposure to PCBs fell well below U.K. dietary and inhalation exposure .
Contrastingly , a high-end estimate of HBCD dust exposure exceeded U.K. dietary exposure substantially .
Moreover , high-end estimates of dust exposure to BDE-99 and BDE-209 ( 4.3 and 13000 ng/kg bw/day , respectively ) exceeded HBLVs of 0.23-0.30 and 7000 ng/kg bw/day respectively .
