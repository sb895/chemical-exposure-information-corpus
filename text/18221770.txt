The Centre for Environment and Health in Flanders , the Northern part of Belgium , started a biomonitoring program on adolescents in 2003. 1679 adolescents residing in nine areas with different patterns of pollution participated in the study .
Possible confounding effects of lifestyle and personal characteristics were taken into account .
The geometric mean levels of cadmium and lead in whole blood amounted to 0.36 and 21.7 microg l(-1) , those of PCBs , DDE and HCB in serum to 68 , 94 and 20.9 ng g(-1) fat , and those of 1-hydroxypyrene and t,t'-muconic acid in urine to 88 ng g(-1) creatinine and 72 microg g(-1) creatinine .
Significant regional differences in internal lead , cadmium , PCBs , DDE and HCB exposure were observed in function of area of residence , even after adjustment for age , sex , smoking ( and body mass index for the chlorinated compounds ) .
Compared to a reference mean , internal exposure was significantly higher in one or more of the areas : Cd and Pb in the Antwerp agglomeration , Cd in the Antwerp harbour , PCBs in the Ghent agglomeration , PCBs , DDE and HCB in the Ghent harbour , Cd , PCBs , DDE and HCB in the rural area , DDE in Olen and in the Albert canal areas .
Adolescents living in an area with intensive fruit cultivation ( showing overall the lowest values ) and , surprisingly , in areas around household waste incinerators ( average of six areas ) , had no significantly increased internal exposures .
Subjects from separate areas around waste incinerators showed significant differences in body load of various environmental contaminants .
