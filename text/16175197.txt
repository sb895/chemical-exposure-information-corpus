Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in Mexico City and have shown a rising trend over the past 20 years .
Various epidemiological studies have reported an association between respirable particles and carbon monoxide ( CO ) , with cardiorespiratory outcomes .
The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of less than 2.5 microm ( PM(2.5) ) , also known as respirable or fine particles and CO on heart rate variability ( HRV ) in 5-min periods in patients with known ischemic heart disease. 30 patients were selected from the outpatient clinic of the National Institute of Cardiology of Mexico and followed during 11 h , using electrocardiography ( ECG ) ambulatory electrocardiograms and personal monitors for CO and PM(2.5) .
We calculated frequency-domain measurements using power spectral analysis and assessed the association with pollutants using mixed models analysis in 5-min periods .
We found a decrease in HRV measured as high frequency ( Ln ) ( coefficient=-0.008 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , -0.015 , 0.0004 ) for each 10 microg/m(3) ( micrograms per cubic meter ) increase of personal PM(2.5) exposure .
We also found a decrease of low ( ln ) ( coefficient=-0.024 , 95% CI , -0.041 , -0.007 ) and very low frequencies ( ln ) ( coefficient=-0.034 , 95% CI , -0.061 , -0.007 ) for 1 parts per million ( p.p.m. ) increase in CO personal exposure after adjustment for potential confounding factors .
These results show that for this high-risk population , the alteration of the cardiac autonomic regulation was significantly associated with both PM(2.5) and CO personal exposures .
