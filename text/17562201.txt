Total suspended particulate matter and deposition fluxes of particles were investigated in the town of Didouche Mourad which is located 13 km north of Constantine .
Samples of air particulate matter were collected at one site located in the heart of the town and situated 3 km north of a cement plant .
Samples were collected from 2 November 2002 to 28 April 2003 every 3 days using a high volume air sampler .
Sampling intervals were 24 h in all cases .
During the same period , samples of dust fallout were collected at the same site .
Samples were collected at 30-day intervals .
Lead , chromium , manganese , nickel , copper , cobalt and cadmium deposition fluxes were measured and both the soluble and insoluble fractions were determined .
Furthermore , the information gathered by this study was correlated with the corresponding hourly weather data provided by a weather station installed at the study station .
The possible sources for dust and trace metals were analyzed by comparing average contributions of wind aspects to the concentrations and depositions of mass and chemical species with the average frequencies of wind direction .
The mean concentration was 300 microg/m3 .
The average dust deposition rate through the period of study was 221 mg/(m2.day) .
Results indicate that anthropogenic sources contribute greatly to trace elements .
An exposure assessment to the heavy metals taking into account the inhalation route and soil dust ingestion was carried out and allowed direct comparison of trace metal intakes via these routes .
