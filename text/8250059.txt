A respiratory health survey was conducted in a grain mill and the relationship of health indicators to quantitative measures of airborne dust , fungal , and bacterial contamination was examined .
Respiratory symptoms were more prevalent in the high dust exposure categories ; lung function levels were also higher in the high dust exposure categories , consistent with a " healthy " worker effect .
Workers in the three higher dust exposure categories showed either no change or a decrease in lung function over the working week , while workers in the low exposure category demonstrated an improvement in lung function over the working week .
Total dust and microbiological ( fungal and bacterial ) load were found to be significantly related to each other , and the relationship of microbiological load to lung function level and changes over the working week were similar to those found for total dust .
