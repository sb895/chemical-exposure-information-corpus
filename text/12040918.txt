It has been argued that the release of mercury from amalgam fillings is of toxicological relevance .
The aim of the study was to determine the internal mercury exposure of two groups differing in their attitude towards possible health hazards by mercury from amalgam fillings .
It was to be examined if the two groups differ with regard to the mercury concentration in different biological matrices and to compare the results with current reference values .
Blood , urine and saliva samples were analyzed from 40 female subjects who claimed to suffer from serious health damage due to amalgam fillings ( "amalgam sensitive subjects"). 43 female control subjects did not claim any association ( "amalgam non-sensitive controls" ) .
Mercury was determined by means of cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry .
Number and surfaces of amalgam fillings were determined by dentists for each subject .
Median ( range ) mercury levels in blood were 2.35 ( 0.25-13.40 ) micrograms/l for " amalgam sensitive subjects " and 2.40 ( 0.25-10.50 ) micrograms/l for " amalgam non-sensitive controls " .
In urine , the median mercury concentrations were 1.55 ( 0.06-14.70 ) micrograms/l and 1.88 ( 0.20-8.43 ) micrograms/g creatinine respectively .
No significant differences could be found between the two groups .
Mercury levels in blood and urine of the examined subjects were within the range of background levels in the general population including persons with amalgam fillings .
Stimulated saliva contained 76.4 ( 6.7-406.0 ) micrograms mercury/l in " amalgam sensitive subjects " and 57.0 ( 2.8-559.0 ) micrograms mercury/l in controls ( not significant ) .
Mercury levels in saliva did not correlate with the concentrations in blood and urine , but merely with the number of amalgam fillings or of the filling surfaces .
Mercury in saliva is therefore not recommended for a biological monitoring .
