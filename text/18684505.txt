BACKGROUND Phthalates , reproductive toxicants in animals , are synthetic chemicals with ubiquitous human exposures because of their extensive use , with potential detrimental health effects .
Infants are considered to represent a population at increased risk , as they are exposed early in life to several different sources of exposure to phthalates .
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS Little information exists on phthalate exposure through breast milk from different geographic areas .
By means of a LC/LC-MS/MS method we tested the presence of several different phthalate metabolites in breast milk from 62 healthy mothers living in Southern Italy .
RESULTS The simple monoesters mono-isobutyl phthalate ( MiBP ) ( median 18.8 microg/l ) and mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( MEHP ) ( median 8.4 microg/l ) were present in all milk samples , whereas mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MnBP ) ( median 1.5 microg/l ) and mono-benzyl phthalate ( MBzP ) ( median <0.3 microg/l ) were found in 64.5% and 43.5% of the samples , respectively .
Among the oxidative metabolites of DEHP and DiNP only mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate ( 5cx-MEPP ) and monoisononyl phthalate with one hydroxyl group ( OH-MiNP ) were detectable in one and 13 samples ( 21% ) , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that exposure to phthalates through breast milk in Southern Italian infants is comparable to that of other countries , thus confirming that human milk may represent an additional potential source of phthalate exposure in a population at increased risk .
However , different milk concentrations of MiBP may suggest a different pattern of usage of di-iso-butyl phthalate in Europe , as compared to USA , whereas for the first time , we detected an oxidative DiNP metabolite , whose significance remains unclear .
