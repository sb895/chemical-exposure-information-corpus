In order to compare the magnitudes and health impacts of arsenic and other toxic trace elements in well water , groundwater and hair samples were collected from three areas with different arsenic exposure scenarios in the Mekong River basin of Cambodia .
Ampil commune in Kampong Cham province was selected as an uncontaminated area , Khsarch Andaet commune in Kratie province was selected as a moderately contaminated area , and Kampong Kong commune in Kandal Province was selected as an extremely contaminated area .
Results of ICP-MS analyses of the groundwater samples revealed that As , Mn , Fe and Ba concentrations were significantly different among the three study areas ( Kruskal-Wallis test , p < 0.0001 ) .
Out of 46 observed wells in the Kandal province study area , 100% detected As > 50 \u03bcg L(-1) and Fe > 300 \u03bcg L(-1) ; 52.17% had Mn > 400 \u03bcg L(-1) and 73.91% found Ba > 700 \u03bcg L(-1) .
In the Kratie province study area ( n = 12 ) , 25% of wells showed elevated arsenic levels above 10 \u03bcg L(-1) and 25% had Mn > 400 \u03bcg L(-1) , whereas samples from Kampong Cham province study area ( n = 18 ) were relatively clean , with As < 10 \u03bcg L(-1) .
A health risk assessment model derived from the USEPA was applied to calculate individual risks resulting from drinking groundwater .
Computational results indicated that residents from Kandal Province study area ( n = 297 ) confronted significantly higher non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks than those in Kratie ( n = 89 ) and Kampong Cham ( n = 184 ) province study areas ( Kruskal-Wallis test , p < 0.0001). 98.65% of respondents from the Kandal province study area were at risk for the potential non-cancer effect and an average cancer risk index was found to be 5 in 1000 exposure .
The calculations also indicated that , in the Kratie province study area , 13.48% of respondents were affected by non-cancer health risks and 33.71% were threatened by cancer , whereas none of respondents in the Kampong Cham province study area appeared to have non-carcinogenic effect .
Positively significant correlations of the arsenic content in scalp hair ( As(h) ) with both arsenic levels in groundwater ( As(w) ) ( r(s) ( 304 ) = 0.757 , p < 0.0001 ) and individual average daily doses ( ADD ) of arsenic ( r(s) ( 304 ) = 0.763 , p < 0.0001 ) undoubtedly indicated that arsenic accumulation in the bodies of Cambodia residents in the Mekong River basin was mainly through a groundwater drinking pathway .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first comprehensive report comparing individual health risk assessments of arsenic exposure through a groundwater drinking pathway to enriched arsenic levels from groundwater in the Mekong River basin , Cambodia .
This study indicates that elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater may lead to thousands of cases of arsenicosis in the near future if mitigating actions are not taken .
