The concentrations of Ni , Cu , Zn , and Pb in human scalp hair of 281 individuals working in 10 Syrian industrial plants were determined using co-precipitation by ammoniumpyrolidinedithiocarbamate ( APDC ) method for total reflection X-ray fluorescence ( TXRF ) analysis .
The results were compared to data obtained for a control group consisted of individuals working at the Syrian Atomic Energy Commission and also to data reported in the literature .
The results given by the group of workers in battery plant showed that Pb concentration in human scalp hair samples were higher than those for control group , while some abnormal concentrations were obtained for Cu , Zn and Ni in cables , printing and battery plants , respectively .
Normal concentrations of these elements were obtained for hair workers in olive oil , power stations , textile , and iron industrial plants .
The relationships of Pb-Pb/Ni and Cu-Cu/Ni were plotted with correlation coefficients of 0.9937 and 0.9014 , respectively .
In general , the results showed that , the workers who were occupationally exposed to battery industrial pollution are at risk , followed by individuals in printing and cables industries , while the rest of workers in other industries are considered occupationally unexposed .
