Children can be exposed to pesticides from numerous residential sources such as carpet , house dust , toys and clothing from treated homes , and flea control remedies on pets .
In the present studies , 48 pet dogs ( 24 in each of two studies ) of different breeds and weights were treated with over-the-counter flea collars containing chlorpyrifos ( CP ) , an organophosphorus insecticide .
Transferable insecticide residues were quantified on cotton gloves used to rub the dogs for 5 min and on cotton tee shirts worn by a child ( Study 2 only ) .
First morning urine samples were also obtained from adults and children in both studies for metabolite ( 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ) quantification .
Blood samples were obtained from treated dogs in Study 1 and plasma cholinesterase ( ChE ) activity was monitored .
Transferable residues on gloves for all compounds were highest near the neck of the dogs and were lowest in areas most distant from the neck .
Rubbing samples ( over the collar ) at two weeks post-collar application contained 447+/-57 microg CP/glove while samples from the fur of the back contained 8+/-2 microg CP/glove .
In Study 2 , cotton tee shirts worn by children at 15 days post-collar application for 4 h showed CP levels of 134+/-66 ng/g shirt .
There were significant differences between adults and children in the levels of urinary metabolites with children generally having higher urinary levels of metabolites than adults ( grand mean+/-SE ; 11.6+/-1.1 and 7.9+/-0.74 ng/mg creatinine for children and adults , respectively , compared to 9.4+/-0.8 and 6.9+/-0.5 ng/mg creatinine before collar placement ) .
Therefore , there was little evidence that the use of this flea collar contributed to enhanced CP exposure of either children or adults .
