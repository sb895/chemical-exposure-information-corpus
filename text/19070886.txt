We conducted a congener-specific analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in blood collected from 242 Yusho patients ( mean : 65.5 years , median : 67.0 years ) and 74 Yusho-suspected persons ( mean : 54.7 years , median : 55.0 years ) in 2004 , and compared each congener concentrations of PCBs among the groups of Yusho patients , Yusho-suspected persons , and normal controls ( mean : 68.1 years , median : 67.0 years ) with the concentrations previously reported .
Among the 209 PCB congeners , 8 congeners of mono-ortho PCBs and 56 congeners of non-dioxin-like PCBs were identified in the blood of Yusho patients and Yusho-suspected persons .
Among the PCB congeners measured in the present study , hexaCB-153 , hexaCB-138 , heptaCB-180 , and heptaCB-182/heptaCB-187 showed high ratios to total concentrations of 64 PCB congeners detected in the blood of Yusho patients and Yusho-suspected persons , and the congener profiles were the same as those obtained in normal controls .
The sums of the concentrations of 64 PCB congeners in the blood of Yusho patients and Yusho-suspected persons were 40-3032 ( mean : 645 , median : 536 ) and 20-1418 ( mean : 355 , median : 317 ) ng g(-1) lipid , respectively , and the concentrations were 50% higher and 20% lower than those of normal controls , respectively .
The relative contribution ratios of the concentrations of the triCBs , tetraCBs , and pentaCBs to the total concentrations of 64 PCB congeners in the blood of Yusho patients were slightly lower than those of Yusho-suspected persons and normal controls , and the ratios of nonaCBs and decaCB-209 concentrations were nearly the same among the Yusho patients , Yusho-suspected persons , and normal controls .
However , the ratios of the concentrations of hexaCBs , heptaCBs , and octaCBs to the total concentrations of 64 PCB congeners in the blood of Yusho patients tended to be slightly higher compared to those of the Yusho-suspected persons and normal controls .
From the results comparing the concentrations of 64 PCB congeners in the blood between Yusho patients and normal controls , the concentrations of hexaCB-156 , hexaCB-157 , heptaCB-181 , and heptaCB-189 of the Yusho patients were 3.4 , 3.8 , 3.9 , and 3.8 times higher than those of the normal controls , respectively , indicating that even now , 35 years after exposure , Yusho patients still have a higher concentration of hexaCB-156 , hexaCB-157 , heptaCB-181 , and heptaCB-189 in their blood than do unaffected people .
These four congeners may be considered the most important congeners for evaluating the PCBs toxicity of Yusho patients .
