Recent publications indicate an increased incidence of lung cancer in non-ferrous smelter workers exposed to lead .
The present study provides further data on selected subgroups in one such cohort .
The cohort was based on 3979 smelter workers employed for at least 1 year between 1928 and 1979 , and also exposed to lead and included in the Blood Lead Register that was started at the smelter in 1950 .
Two subcohorts were formed from the original cohort .
One consists of 710 workers employed at the lead departments ( Lead subcohort 1 ) , and the other of 383 workers employed at the lead departments ( Lead subcohort 2 ) , but never at other works where an excess lung cancer risk was previously identified .
Standardized Cancer Incidence Rates ( SIR ) 1958-1987 were calculated relative to county rates .
In the subcohorts , arsenic exposure in lung cancer cases was assessed in detail based on occupational hygiene information from the company .
Lung cancer incidence was raised in both subcohorts ( Lead subcohort 1 : SIR 2.4 ; 95% CI 1.2-4.5 ; Lead subcohort 2 : SIR 3.6 ; 95% CI 1.2-8.3 ) .
Total cancer incidence in the cohorts was not increased .
A detailed study of arsenic exposure in the 10 lung cancer cases in these two subcohorts revealed that all but one of these cases had a significant exposure also to arsenic .
An elevated incidence of lung cancer was observed in smelter workers exposed to lead .
However , considerable arsenic exposure also occurred in a majority of the lung cancer cases in the investigated subcohorts .
In this multifactorial exposure situation it has not been possible to separate the carcinogenic effects of lead and arsenic , but a possible interaction between these metals may be involved in explaining the carcinogenic risks .
