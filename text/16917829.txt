BACKGROUND Although asphalt fume is a recognized irritant , previous studies of acute symptoms during asphalt paving have produced inconsistent results .
Between 1994 and 1997 , the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) evaluated workers at seven sites in six states .
METHODS NIOSH ( a ) measured exposures of asphalt paving workers to total ( TP ) and benzene-soluble particulate ( BSP ) , polycyclic aromatic compounds , and other substances ; ( b ) administered symptom questionnaires pre-shift , every 2 hr during the shift , and post-shift to asphalt exposed and nonexposed workers ; and ( c ) measured peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) of asphalt paving workers when they completed a symptom questionnaire .
RESULTS Full-shift time-weighted average exposures to TP and BSP ranged from 0.01 to 1.30 mg/m(3) and 0.01 to 0.82 mg/m(3) , respectively .
Most BSP concentrations were <0.50 mg/m(3) .
Asphalt workers had a higher occurrence rate of throat irritation than nonexposed workers [ 13% vs. 4% , odds ratio ( OR ) = 4.0 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.2-13 ] .
TP , as a continuous variable , was associated with eye ( OR = 1.34 , 95% CI : 1.12-1.60 ) and throat ( OR = 1.40 , 95% CI : 1.06-1.85 ) symptoms .
With TP dichotomous at 0.5 mg/m(3) , the ORs and 95% CIs for eye and throat symptoms were 7.5 ( 1.1-50 ) and 15 ( 2.3-103 ) , respectively .
BSP , dichotomous at 0.3 mg/m(3) , was associated with irritant ( eye , nose , or throat ) symptoms ( OR = 11 , 95% CI : 1.5-84 ) .
One worker , a smoker , had PEFR-defined bronchial lability , which did not coincide with respiratory symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS Irritant symptoms were associated with TP and BSP concentrations at or below 0.5 mg/m(3) .
