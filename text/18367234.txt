Mercury ( Hg ) exposure in the population from Wuchuan mercury mining area ( WMMA ) , Guizhou , China , was evaluated by human hair Hg investigation .
Total gaseous mercury ( TGM ) in the ambient air and Hg in rice were measured to assess human risk of Hg exposure .
High TGM concentrations in the ambient air were found near smelting workshop .
Rice not only contained high total mercury ( T-Hg ) which ranged from 6.0-113 ng/g , but also contained highly elevated methylmercury ( Me-Hg ) which ranged from 3.1-13.4 ng/g .
The means of hair T-Hg concentrations were 33.9 microg/g and 21.5 microg/g at YQG and JXC sites , respectively .
Residents from other sites also reflected a certain level of Hg exposure .
Age had no significant effect on hair Hg levels , but male had higher hair T-Hg concentrations due to occupational exposure and also higher Me-Hg levels which might be related to larger amount of rice consumption .
Hair may be a useful tool for monitoring human exposure of Hg vapor in Hg-mining areas .
By a preliminary estimation , the inhalation of Hg polluted air was the main route of inorganic Hg exposure to the smelting workers and vicinal residents ; but the population in the study area was also at a potential risk of Me-Hg exposure via rice intake .
