Two methods used for retrospective evaluation of occupational exposures , a case by case assessment by expert and the application of a job exposure matrix ( JEM ) , are compared using occupational histories collected for a case-control study on sinonasal cancer .
The objective was to identify the main sources of discrepancies and to contribute to an optimal use of a JEM for population-based case-control studies .
Comparisons were based on job periods , and were performed separately for two substances : formaldehyde and wood-dust .
Job periods were classified according to the category of exposure assigned by the matrix , and to the probability and level of exposure assessed by the study expert .
The sources of discrepancies were examined for job periods probably or definitely exposed according to the JEM and unexposed for the expert , or unexposed in the JEM and probably or definitely exposed to medium or high level for the expert .
Such discrepancies were observed for 8% of the job periods for formaldehyde and 3% of the job periods for wood-dust .
The agreement between the two approaches was better for wood-dust than for formaldehyde .
The relative importance of different sources of discrepancies was not the same for formaldehyde and wood-dust .
For formaldehyde a substantial part of the discrepancies was due to disagreements between the study expert and the matrix experts , which were mostly differences in threshold limits between ' not exposed ' and ' definitely exposed at a low level ' .
Differences between experts ' opinions did not explain the discordances observed for wood-dust .
The presence of additional information in the questionnaire was an important source of discrepancy for the two substances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
