Fifteen polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and eighteen non-PBDEs were measured in 116 dust samples collected from homes in Vancouver , Canada during 2007-2008 as part of the Chemicals Health and Pregnancy ( CHirP ) study .
The highest concentrations of PBDEs in house dust were observed for BDE 209 , with a median concentration of 1350 ng/g .
This is about two times greater than the median concentration of the PentaBDE ( represented by the most abundant compounds in this formulation , \u03a3BDE 47 , 99 and 100 ) .
In the case of non-PBDE FRs , a detection frequency between 81% and 100% was observed for nine analytes including : HBCD , BTBPE , BEHTBP , EHTBB , HBB , PBTO , PBBe , ATE and DP .
The high detection of new FRs in indoor environments reflects their ubiquitous presence in indoor environment due to regulation of the PBDEs .
Exposure to FRs are estimated based on these data for adults and toddlers .
