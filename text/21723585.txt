Accumulated maternal dioxins are passed onto the fetus and neonate via the placenta and maternal milk .
In Japan in 1968 , an accidental human exposure to rice oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and other dioxin-related compounds , such as polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , led to development of Yusho oil disease .
We investigated differences in blood dioxin concentrations in mother-children pairs affected by the Yusho incident .
From 2002 to 2008 , blood samples were collected from 26 pairs of Yusho mothers and their children ( 19 mothers , 26 children ) .
Specific congeners of seven polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , ten PCDFs , and four non-ortho PCBs were analyzed .
The children had significantly lower TEQ concentrations of PCDDs , PCDFs , and coplanar PCBs compared to their mothers .
The mother-child difference in blood concentrations varied with the congeners ; the largest for 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF and the smallest for 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptaCDD .
The level for 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF , which characterizes Yusho oil disease , was approximately 17-30 times higher in the mothers than in the general population , whereas there were no significant differences between children in the formula-fed group and the general population .
In contrast , the mean level for 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF in the breast-fed group was approximately 1.5 times , ( range 0.5-6.5 times ) higher than that in the general population .
Over 30 years after the Yusho incident , the mean blood dioxin levels in the offspring were only a fraction of the levels in their mothers .
This is more consistent with exposure via breast milk than via transplacental transfer in the Yusho incident .
