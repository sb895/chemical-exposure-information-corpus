The environmental contamination by dioxins and furans ( PCDD/PCDF ) of a local area in southwest Germany due to pyrolytic processes led to a survey of health consequences in the exposed population. 2,3,7,8-TCDD ( 8000 ng/kg TE ( ppt) ) was found in the soil and up to 585000 ng/kg TE in attic dust in private homes .
In a randomized study group of definitively exposed persons , a neuropsychological test battery was applied and its value as a diagnostic tool investigated .
A total group of 19 persons participated in a standard neuropsychological examination including common procedures to evaluate mnestic and attentional performance and psychomotor speed ( e.g. , WAIS , WMS-R , TMT , and symptom and mood checklists ) .
The range of PCDD/PCDF between 16 and 80 ( mean 31 ) ppt did not vary substantially from blood fat values in a national sample .
Results of neuropsychological testing showed only slight deviations from the expected range .
Nevertheless , in a high-level exposure group , a reduction of verbal conceptualization , mnestic organization of verbal and visual stimuli , and psychomotor slowing was found .
Among other correlations visual exploration speed ( TMT ) was most directly related to TE .
Affective symptoms ( such as irritability and emotional instability ) were also related to exposure .
Results indicate that standard neuropsychological testing can be recommended for the routine evaluation of chronic dioxin exposure .
