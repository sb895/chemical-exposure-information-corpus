The study was undertaken to examine the nature of particulate chalk dust settled on classroom floor during traditional teaching with dusting and non-dusting chalks on two types of boards viz. rough and smooth .
Settling chalk particles were collected for 30 min during teaching in glass Petri plates placed in classrooms within 3 m distance from the teaching boards .
Particle size distribution , scanning electron microscopic images of chalk dusts and compressive strength of two types of chalks were tested and evaluated .
Results showed that a larger proportion of dusts generated from anti-dusting chalks were of <4.5 and <2.5 microm size on both smooth and rough boards , as compared to dusting chalks .
Non-dusting chalks , on an average , produced about 56% and 62% ( by volume ) of <4.5 microm ( respirable ) diameter , on rough and smooth boards , respectively , while the corresponding values for dusting chalks were 36% and 45% .
Also , on an average , 83% and 94% ( by volume ) of the particles were <11 microm ( thoracic ) in case of non-dusting chalks against 61% and 72% for dusting chalks on rough and smooth boards , respectively .
Interestingly , taking into account the mass of chalk dust produced per unit time , which was higher in dusting chalks than non dusting chalks , the former was actually producing higher amount of PM <4.5 and <11 particles from both types of boards .
Scanning electron microscope images revealed that chalk particles had random shape , although in dusting chalks prevalence of elongated particles was observed , apparently due to the longitudinal breaking of the chalks during writing , which was confirmed during compressive strength testing .
We could conclude that dusting chalks could be potentially more harmful than anti dusting chalks , as they produced higher amount of potentially dangerous PM 4.5 and PM 11 .
