Toasting friends and family with realgar wines and painting children's foreheads and limbs with the leftover realgar/alcohol slurries is an important customary ritual during the Dragon Boat Festival ( DBF ) ; a Chinese national holiday and ancient feast day celebrated throughout Asia .
Realgar is an arsenic sulfide mineral , and source of highly toxic inorganic arsenic .
Despite the long history of realgar use during the DBF , associated risk to human health by arsenic ingestion or percutaneous adsorption is unknown .
To address this urine samples were collected from a cohort of volunteers who were partaking in the DBF festivities .
The total concentration of arsenic in the wine consumed was 70 mg L⁻¹ with all the arsenic found to be inorganic .
Total arsenic concentrations in adult urine reached a maximum of ca. 550 \u03bcg L⁻¹ ( mean 220.2 \u03bcg L⁻¹ ) after 16 h post-ingestion of realgar wine , while face painting caused arsenic levels in children's urine to soar to 100 \u03bcg L⁻¹ ( mean 85.3 \u03bcg L⁻¹ ) 40 h after the initial paint application .
The average concentration of inorganic arsenic in the urine of realgar wine drinkers on average doubled 16 h after drinking , although this was not permanent and levels subsided after 28 h .
As would be expected in young children , the proportions of organic arsenic in the urine remained high throughout the 88-h monitoring period .
However , even when arsenic concentrations in the urine peaked at 40 h after paint application , concentrations in the urine only declined slightly thereafter , suggesting pronounced longer term dermal accumulation and penetration of arsenic .
Drinking wines blended with realgar or using realgar based paints on children does result in the significant absorption of arsenic and therefore presents a potentially serious and currently unquantified health risk .
