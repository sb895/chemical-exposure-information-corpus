The Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) sought to determine baseline exposures to POPs in the general population ; however , in developing countries , exposure to these chemicals in hot spots may be an issue of public health considering its magnitude .
Therefore , the aim of this study was to assess the levels of POPs in the blood of children living in three communities in the Southeastern Region of Mexico .
During 2007 , we studied a total of 96 healthy children ( aged 6-12 years ) .
Quantitative analyses were performed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry .
High levels of p,p'-DDT and its principal metabolite , p,p'-DDE , were found in the blood of children living in the three communities studied , the levels ranged from 463.5 to 9046.3 ng/g lipid and from 490.8 to 57,712.4 ng/g lipid for DDT and DDE , respectively .
In addition , high levels of lindane ( \u03b3-HCH ) were found , with mean levels ranging between 575.4 and 6580.6 ng/g lipid .
Moreover , children living in the study region were also exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and the levels of these compounds in the blood of children were very similar between the communities with mean levels of around 3000 ng/g lipid ( total PCBs ) .
In conclusion , we demonstrated that children living in the studied communities were exposed to complex chemical mixtures ( DDT , DDE , lindane and PCBs ) rather than to individual compounds .
Therefore , in future studies it is important to understand the potential interactions between the components of these mixtures .
