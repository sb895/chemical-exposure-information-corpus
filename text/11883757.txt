Total mercury and selenium concentrations were determined in hair samples collected from Wari ( Pacaás Novos ) Indians living in Doutor Tanajura village , Gujará-Mirim city , Rond\u0135nia State .
The mercury concentrations in some samples are much higher than the values determined in samples from individuals not exposed to mercury contamination , occupationally or environmentally .
The selenium concentrations are in the normal range .
A correlation was observed between the mercury and selenium concentration and the values of the molar ratio approach 1 at low Hg concentrations .
This fact is related to the equimolar complex formed by [ (Hg-Se)n]m-Seleprotein P , which can decrease the bioavailable mercury in the organism .
