Concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and coplanar biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) were determined in Japanese human adipose tissues .
Temporal trends were assessed by comparing data collected during 1970-1971 , 1994-1996 and 2000 .
Mean TEQ levels of PCDD/Fs in human adipose tissue showed a significant decrease from 31.6 +/- 9.2 pg-TEQ/g fat wt in 1970-1971 to 11.9 +/- 7.4 pg-TEQ/g fat wt in 2000 , and coplanar PCBs decreased from 35.4 +/- 21.9 pg-TEQ/g fat wt in 1970-1971 to 15.3 +/- 8.2 pg-TEQ/g fat wt in 2000 .
However , some PCB congener concentrations did not change during this time .
A comparison of data using the latest PCB-TEQ showed no significant changes .
Therefore , research on source characterization and monitoring of short-term temporal trends on these compounds should be carried out continuously .
