Phthalate esters are among the most ubiquitous of indoor pollutants and have been associated with various adverse health effects .
In the present study we assessed the cross-sectional association between eight different phthalate metabolites in urine and allergic disease in young children .
As part of the Danish Indoor Environment and Children's Health study , urine samples were collected from 440 children aged 3-5 years , of whom 222 were healthy controls , 68 were clinically diagnosed with asthma , 76 with rhinoconjunctivitis and 81 with atopic dermatitis ( disease subgroups are not mutually exclusive ; some children had more than one disease ) .
There were no statistically significant differences in the urine concentrations of phthalate metabolites between cases and healthy controls with the exception of MnBP and MECPP , which were higher in healthy controls compared with the asthma case group .
In the crude analysis MnBP and MiBP were negatively associated with asthma .
In the analysis adjusted for multiple factors , only a weak positive association between MEP in urine and atopic dermatitis was found ; there were no positive associations between any phthalate metabolites in urine and either asthma or rhinoconjunctivitis .
These findings appear to contradict earlier studies .
Differences may be due to higher exposures to certain phthalates ( e.g. , BBzP ) via non-dietary pathways in earlier studies , phthalates serving as surrogates for an agent associated with asthma ( e.g. , PVC flooring ) in previous studies but not the present study or altered cleaning habits and the use of " allergy friendly " products by parents of children with allergic disease in the current study in contrast to studies conducted earlier .
