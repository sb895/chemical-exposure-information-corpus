To study the influence of mariculture on mercury ( Hg ) speciation and distribution in sediments and cultured fish around Hong Kong and adjacent mainland China waters , sediment samples were collected from six mariculture sites and the corresponding reference sites , 200-300 m away from the mariculture sites .
Mariculture activities increased total mercury , organic matter , carbon , nitrogen and sulfur concentrations in the surface sediments underneath mariculture sites , possibly due to the accumulation of unconsumed fish feed and fish excretion .
However , methylmercury ( MeHg ) concentrations and the ratio of MeHg to THg ( % MeHg ) in sediments underneath mariculture sites were lower than the corresponding reference sites .
The % MeHg in sediments was negatively correlated ( r = -0.579 , p < 0.05 ) with organic matter ( OM ) content among all sites , indicating that OM may have inhibited Hg methylation in surface sediments .
Three mariculture fish species were collected from each mariculture site , including red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus ) , orange-spotted grouper ( Epinephelus coioides ) and snubnose pompano ( Trachinotus blochii ) .
The average MeHg concentration in fish muscle was 75 \u03bcg kg⁻¹ ( wet weight ) , and the dietary intake of MeHg through fish consumption for Hong Kong residents was 0.37 \u03bcg kg⁻¹ week⁻¹ , which was lower than the corresponding WHO limits ( 500 \u03bcg kg⁻¹ and 1.6 \u03bcg kg⁻¹ week⁻¹ ) .
