Chronic exposure to heavy metals has long been recognized as being capable to increase head and neck cancer incidence among exposed human populations .
Head and neck cancer is a significant public health issue in Tunisia .
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the concentrations of As , Cd , Cr and Ni in healthy and tumor tissues of head and neck cancer patients .
Metal concentrations were determined in tumor and healthy tissues of 101 head and neck cancer patients , using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry .
The As , Cd , Cr , and Ni levels in tumor tissues were 3.4 , 2.5 , 1.3 and 1.5 times higher than those of healthy tissues ( p<0.05 ) , respectively .
Tumor tissue metal levels were higher in men than in women .
As and Cd levels in tumor and healthy tissue samples of patients smokers are significantly higher than those of non-smokers ( p<0.05 ) .
A strong effect of cumulative smoking as expressed in the number of pack per year , and tumor tissue Cd levels were positively associated with three groups of age ( <40 , 51-60 and >60 years ) in both never-smokers and ever-smokers ( <20 and \u226520 pack per year ) .
Healthy tissue Cd levels were negatively associated with age in those three groups of smokers .
The highest Cd and Cr concentrations among both workers and non-workers were observed in tumor tissues .
The Cd and Cr in tissues of farmers , bricklayers and painters were all significantly higher among the workers as compared with the non-workers group .
Tissue metal levels have increased due to smoking and occupational exposure .
Heavy metal exposure via tobacco smoking and occupational exposures may increase the risk of head and neck in the Tunisian population .
