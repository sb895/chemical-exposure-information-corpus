Human hair samples from male and female people aged 6-85 years , as well as muscle of crabs ( Callinectes sapidus and Callinectes bocourti ) were collected from different fishing places along the Caribbean coastal shoreline of Colombia and analyzed for total mercury ( T-Hg ) in order to establish the impact of mercury-polluted sediments in Cartagena bay on the ecosystem .
Hair T-Hg in inhabitants varied between 0.1 and 21.8 microg/g , with average and median of 1.52 microg/g and 1.1 microg/g , respectively .
Differences between sampling locations were significant ( P<0.01 ) and median values decreased in the order : Caño del Oro ( 1.5 microg/g)<Bocachica ( 1.4 microg/g ) ( both located in Cartagena Bay)<Coveñas ( 1.2 microg/g)<Lomarena ( 0.7 microg/g)=Tasajera ( 0.7 microg/g ) .
A similar trend was observed for T-Hg in muscle of crabs , however , along Cartagena bay , T-Hg distribution in these organisms varied widely , with highest values detected in samples collected in front of the extinct chlor-alkali plant .
Although the T-Hg median for these people is equal to the threshold risk level recommended by U.S. EPA , this study highlights the fact that contaminated sediments are still driving the distribution of mercury through the food chain , allowing its accumulation in fishermen whose diet includes marine products as sources of protein .
