A mass balance of human dietary PCDD/F-intake and fecal PCDD/F-excretion was carried out .
The participants of the study were seven male and seven female adults between the ages of 24 to 64 years , living in North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany .
The PCDD/F-intake was measured using the duplicate method .
Sampling time of each food duplicate covered three days .
The fecal PCDD/F-excretion was measured by collecting the feces which corresponded to the food duplicates .
The mean daily dietary PCDD/F-intake was 49 pg I-TEq/d ( range : 23-96 pg I-TEq/d ) and therewith lower than that estimated in the past .
The mean daily fecal PCDD/F-excretion was 98 pg I-TEq/d ( 40-200 pg I-TEq/d ) .
This is twice the amount of the PCDD/F-intake .
The fecal excretion of OCDD was especially higher than the dietary intake ( mean : 7 fold , range : 1.2-21 fold ) .
The differences between PCDD/F-intake and PCDD/F-excretion may be caused by a reduction of the body burden as a consequence of decreasing PCDD/F-intake .
Other explanations were additional sources of exposure to PCDD/F or de novo formation of PCDD/F in the human body .
