Environmental exposures to benzene result in increases in body burden that are reflected in various biomarkers of exposure , including benzene in exhaled breath , benzene in blood and urinary trans-trans-muconic acid and S-phenylmercapturic acid .
A review of the literature indicates that these biomarkers can be used to distinguish populations with different levels of exposure ( such as smokers from nonsmokers and occupationally exposed from environmentally exposed populations ) and to determine differences in metabolism .
Biomarkers in humans have shown that the percentage of benzene metabolized by the ring-opening pathway is greater at environmental exposures than that at higher occupational exposures , a trend similar to that found in animal studies .
This suggests that the dose-response curve is nonlinear ; that potential different metabolic mechanisms exist at high and low doses ; and that the validity of a linear extrapolation of adverse effects measured at high doses to a population exposed to lower , environmental levels of benzene is uncertain .
Time-series measurements of the biomarker , exhaled breath , were used to evaluate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) model .
Biases were identified between the PBPK model predictions and experimental data that were adequately described using an empirical compartmental model .
It is suggested that a mapping of the PBPK model to a compartmental model can be done to optimize the parameters in the PBPK model to provide a future framework for developing a population physiologically based pharmacokinetic model .
