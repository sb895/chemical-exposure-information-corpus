An estimated 40 million people in Bangladesh have been suffering from arsenic toxicity-related diseases because of drinking water contamination with high levels of naturally occurring arsenic .
To evaluate the biochemical changes in chronic arsenic exposure , a total of 115 exposed subjects diagnosed as arsenicosis patients were examined and interviewed , and 120 unexposed volunteers were enrolled in this study .
Drinking water , urine and peripheral blood samples were collected from all participants and analyzed .
The average levels of arsenic in the drinking water and spot urine samples of the arsenicosis patients were 218.1 microg/L and 234.6 microg/L , respectively , and duration of exposure was 7.6 +/- 5.2 yrs that ranged from 1-25 yrs .
Prevalence of diabetes mellitus among chronic arsenic-exposed subjects was about 2.8 times higher than the unexposed subjects .
The activities of alkaline phosphatase were significantly elevated in the patients , 197 U/L compared to 149 U/L in the controls , but alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were mostly normal .
The patients had significantly lower levels of serum creatinine , 0.97 mg/dL compared to 1.15 mg/dL in the controls ; but had significantly elevated levels of total protein , 84 g/L and 77 g/L respectively .
The mean level of inorganic phosphate in the serum of arsenicosis patients was 6.4 mg/dL compared to 4.6 mg/dL in the unexposed subjects and the level was significantly higher , indicating substitution of the pentavalent arsenate for the phosphate ion causing underutilization of the latter .
Evaluation of the lipid profiles showed while the levels of triacylglycerol were not much different , the patients had significantly lower levels of cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol compared to the unexposed subjects .
These findings suggest significant changes in biochemical parameters in human arsenic toxicity .
