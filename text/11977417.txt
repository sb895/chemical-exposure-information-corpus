Traditional methods for monitoring occupational creosote exposure have focused on inhalation .
However , there is evidence that dermal exposure contributes importantly to total systemic dose , as measured by biological monitoring methods .
This study was conducted to further characterize the relationships between inhalation and dermal exposures to creosote , and to compare traditional ambient exposure monitoring versus biological monitoring in 36 creosote-exposed wood treatment workers .
Full-shift personal air samples were obtained , along with post-shift and next-day urine measurements for 1-hydroxypyrene .
There was little or no correlation between airborne measures and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene ( r2 = 0.05 to 0.35 ) .
More than 90% of 1-hydroxypyrene could be attributed to dermal exposure .
These data indicate that traditional monitoring methods may be inappropriate for creosote workers , raising concerns about the adequacy of methods currently mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
