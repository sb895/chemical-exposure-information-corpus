Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) , notably perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , have been reported in human blood .
Furthermore , the occurrence of PFCs in the blood of newborn babies , coupled with the need to study the potential association of PFC exposure with birth outcomes in neonates , suggests the need for determining the sources and magnitude of exposure in infants .
In this study , nine PFCs were measured in 45 human breast milk samples collected in 2004 from Massachusetts , U.S.A. PFOS and PFOA were the predominant PFCs found at mean concentrations of 131 and 43.8 pg/mL , respectively .
Comparison of the ratio of PFOS to PFOA in human milk with the ratios published for human serum from the U.S. female population suggested preferential partitioning of PFOA to milk .
Concentrations of PFOA were significantly higher in the milk of mothers nursing for the first time ( n = 34 ) than in the milk of mothers who have previously nursed ( n = 8 ) .
Based on the estimated body weight and milk intake , the average and highest daily intakes of total PFCs by infants were 23.5 and 87.1 ng/kg bw , respectively .
We found that the daily ingestion rates of PFOS and PFOA did not exceed the tolerable daily intake recommended by the U.K. Food Standards Agency .
This is the first study to measure the occurrence of PFCs in human milk from the U.S.A .
