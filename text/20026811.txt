BACKGROUND Consumption of Chinese herbs that contain aristolochic acid ( eg , Mu Tong ) has been associated with an increased risk of urinary tract cancer .
METHODS We conducted a population-based case-control study in Taiwan to examine the association between prescribed Chinese herbal products that contain aristolochic acid and urinary tract cancer .
All patients newly diagnosed with urinary tract cancer ( case subjects ) from January 1 , 2001 , to December 31 , 2002 , and a random sample of the entire insured population from January 1 , 1997 , to December 31 , 2002 ( control subjects ) , were selected from the National Health Insurance reimbursement database .
Subjects who were ever prescribed more than 500 pills of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or acetaminophen were excluded , leaving 4594 case patients and 174,701 control subjects in the final analysis .
Adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) were estimated by using multivariable logistic regression models for the association between prescribed Chinese herbs containing aristolochic acid and the occurrence of urinary tract cancer .
Models were adjusted for age , sex , residence in a township where black foot disease was endemic ( an indicator of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water [ a risk factor for urinary tract cancer] ) , and history of chronic urinary tract infection .
Statistical tests were two-sided .
RESULTS Having been prescribed more than 60 g of Mu Tong and an estimated consumption of more than 150 mg of aristolochic acid were independently associated with an increased risk for urinary tract cancer in multivariable analyses ( Mu Tong : at 61-100 g , OR = 1.6 , 95% CI = 1.3 to 2.1 , and at >200 g , OR = 2.1 , 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.4 ; aristolochic acid : at 151-250 mg , OR = 1.4 , 95% CI = 1.1 to 1.8 , and at >500 mg , OR = 2.0 , 95% CI = 1.4 to 2.9 ) .
A statistically significant linear dose-response relationship was observed between the prescribed dose of Mu Tong or the estimated cumulative dose of aristolochic acid and the risk of urinary tract cancer ( P < .001 for both ) .
CONCLUSIONS Consumption of aristolochic acid-containing Chinese herbal products is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the urinary tract in a dose-dependent manner that is independent of arsenic exposure .
