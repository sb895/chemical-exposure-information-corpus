BACKGROUND Kanemi Yusho is the name given to a 1968 food poisoning incident resulting from the ingestion of PCB contaminated rice bran oil that had been used as a heating medium .
At the time , victims presented with mainly cutaneous manifestations and various other symptoms such as of the eyes and teeth , general fatigue , headaches , and paresthesia of the extremities .
The characteristic symptoms then resolved with time .
Yusho patients have been followed from immediately after the incident .
Blood levels of dioxins such as PeCDF have been measured for those who wishing to since 2001 .
SUBJECTS AND METHODS The presence or absence of relationships between blood PeCDF level and various examination items/symptoms was investigated in 359 subjects whose blood levels of PCB-related chemical compounds such as PeCDF were measured in the Yusho related examinations between 2001 and 2003 .
Characteristic symptoms were also compared with the results of examinations done 15 years previously .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The average blood 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF level in designated Yusho patients was 177.50 pg/g lipids ; showing a markedly higher value than that of the normal control group ( 15.2 pg/g lipids ) .
As well , the blood PeCDF level was related to PCB level , hexachlorobiphenyl level , urinary sugar , erythrocyte sedimetation rate ( ESR ) ( 2-hour ) , thymol and Na .
There were also relationships with cutaneous findings ( acneiform eruption and comedones ) , mucosal findings ( oral pigmentation ) , constipation , numbness in the extremities , body weight loss , and abnormal abdominal ultrasonography .
Symptoms seen in the skin and eyes in 2001 and 2003 had decreased compared with those in seen 1988 .
However , PCB and blood PeCDF levels remained high .
Patients are continuing to present with mucosal and subjective symptoms as chronic conditions .
