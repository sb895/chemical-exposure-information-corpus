In order to determine the effect of perinatal polychlorinated biphenyls and dibenzofurans ( PCBs/PCDFs ) exposure on neonatal and childhood teeth in Yucheng children , we carried out complete dental examinations on 73 Yucheng children born to mothers who ingested high levels of PCBs/PCDFs and 75 matched controls , aged 7-11 years , in 1992 .
Ten of 73 ( 10% ) exposed children were reported to have borne teeth during the neonatal period , while none of the controls did .
The exposed group also had a significantly higher percentage of teeth with congenitally missing tooth germ compared to the controls ( 29 vs 2.7% ) or rotation ( 19 vs 2.7% ) .
The percentages of developmental defects increased significantly with increasing maternal serum PCB levels , childhood PCB and PCDF levels , and the duration of breast feeding .
The maternal PCB level clearly played a more important role in an increased risk of neonatal teeth and developmental defects .
The defects were apparent from the lowest tertile , with a total PCB level of <10 ppb in maternal serum measured nearest to childbirth .
The number of permanent teeth tended to be less in exposed children than in the control group from the age of 11 years onwards .
Our present study has demonstrated for the first time a dose-response relationship between perinatal PCBs/PCDFs exposure and dental defects .
