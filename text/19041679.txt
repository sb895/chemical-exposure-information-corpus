The aim of present study was to develop a database of arsenic ( As ) in lake water , ground water , sediment , soil , vegetables , grain crops and fish to evaluate the potential human health risks posed by higher level of As , in south east part of Sindh , Pakistan during 2005-2007 .
The total concentration of As in various samples under study was determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry ( ETAAS ) .
The reliability and accuracy of technique was checked by different certified reference materials .
The concentration of As in lake and ground water samples exceeded the WHO guideline values .
The concentration of As in lake sediment and agricultural soil samples ranged between 11.3-55.8 and 8.7-46.2 mg/kg while acid soluble As ( acetic acid 0.11 mol/L ) was observed in the range of 1.48-3.54 and 0.34-3.78 mg/kg , respectively .
It was observed that the leafy vegetables ( spinach , coriander and peppermint ) contain higher As levels ( 0.90-1.20 mg/kg ) as compared to ground vegetables ( 0.048-0.25 ) and grain crops ( 0.248-0.367 mg/kg ) on dried weight basis .
The estimated daily intake of total As in the diet was 9.7-12.2 microg/kg body weight/day .
