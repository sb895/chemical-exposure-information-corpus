Although there has been considerable concern regarding cross-border industrial contamination between Mexico and the United States , there are remarkably few data .
One notable case study is the smelter in El Paso , Texas .
In 1974 blood lead levels higher than 40 micrograms/dl were detected in 52% of children studied near the smelter , in the adjacent Mexican community of Anapra in Ciudad Juarez , Chihuahua .
Lead smelting at this plant was halted in 1985 , and as a result , lead levels in air decreased sharply ; consequently , children's exposure to lead and other metals should have diminished accordingly .
In order to assess the effect of removal of lead emissions from the area , three geographical locations in Anapra , varying in distance from the smelter source , were evaluated for lead , arsenic , and cadmium levels in soil and for lead in blood of children .
It was found that lead levels in soil were inversely correlated with distance from the smelter .
Arsenic and cadmium levels in soil were constant among the three sectors .
However , at residential sites closer to the smelter , a higher percentage of children was found with blood lead levels exceeding the Centers for Disease Control's action level of 10.0 micrograms/dl .
In the sector closest to the border 43% of children had blood lead levels greater than 10.0 micrograms/dl .
Although blood lead levels in children living in Anapra have dropped approximately fourfold in 20 years , our results indicate a moderate continued risk of lead exposure .
This study demonstrates the persistent impact that may result from cross-border contamination and raises provocative questions regarding appropriate action and the responsibility for financing such action .
