Arsenic is a very harmful environmental pollutant and arsenic contamination of groundwater has been reported in Bangladesh , West Bengal , India and Nepal .
In order to examine the risk assessment of arsenic , we made the plan to deliver the safe water for purpose of drinking and cooking for one year to 16 arsenic-affected families in Chunakali village , Chapai Nawabganj district , Bangladesh .
We supplied the safe water after treatment of Gravel Sand Filter facility .
The arsenic in drinking water didn't exceed almost 50 ppb for one year .
Before delivering the safe water both on June 2005 and on February 2006 , we visited Chunakali village with Professor Rahman , Associated Professor Belgum and Zaman and diagnosed the arsenic symptom of the arsenic-affected families and collected their urines and hairs .
Also we visited that village on August 2006 of a half year after delivering the safe water and on March 2008 of one year after delivering the safe water .
Due to the supply of safe water for one year for purpose of drinking and cooking , the arsenic symptoms were recovering and the amounts of arsenic in hairs were decreasing .
If Bangladesh government has the good water management in rural areas of arsenic-polluted underground and adopted the appropriate water supply system , the arsenic symptom caused by arsenic should be recovered .
