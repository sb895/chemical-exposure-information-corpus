The objective of this investigation was to examine cerebral magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) pathology and functional deficits demonstrated by neuropsychological testing in cases of toxic encephalopathy .
Two subjects , occupationally exposed to toxic chemicals , were studied .
As part of their neurological assessment , MRI was done and each underwent a neuropsychological battery for patients with toxic exposures ( White et al .
Clin .
Neuropharmacol. 13(5) , 392-412 , 1990 ) .
In Case 1 , who was exposed to inorganic mercury , MRI showed mild central and cortical atrophy .
Punctiform foci ( T2 ) were noted in both frontal regions underlying the precentral gyri and in the subcortical myelin .
Neuropsychological testing showed problems in cognitive flexibility , cognitive tracking , inhibiting perseveration , fine manual motor coordination , visuospatial analysis and organization , memory , and affect and personality .
In Case 2 , who was exposed to 2.6-dimethyl-4-heptanone , MRI showed multiple small foci in the white matter and pons .
Neuropsychological testing indicated affective changes , deficits in manual motor speed , verbal fluency , visuospatial organization , and short-term memory .
Lack of aphasia in patients with toxic encephalopathy indicates that neurotoxins probably affect subcortical and mesial temporal structures more than cortical gray matter .
These MRI studies show subcortical sites of pathology .
