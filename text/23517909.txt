The distribution of acrylamide in food items frequently consumed by Canadian adolescents was determined along with estimates of their contribution to the overall dietary intake of acrylamide .
A total of 196 non-smoking adolescents ( 10-17 years old ) were recruited in Montreal Island population , Canada .
Participants were invited to fill out a 2-day food diary and a food frequency questionnaire over the last month. 146 samples of foods most frequently consumed by participants were analyzed for acrylamide contents .
The highest acrylamide contents were measured in deep-fried french fries and potato chips ( mean ± SD : 1053 ± 657 and 524 ± 276 ng/g respectively ) .
On the basis of the 2-day food diary , median total daily intake of acrylamide was estimated at 0.29 \u03bcg/kg bw/d , as compared to 0.17 \u03bcg/kg bw/d on the basis of the food frequency questionnaire .
These values are similar to those reported in comparable populations .
Deep-fried french fries consumption contributed the most to daily acrylamide intake ( 50% ) followed by potato chips ( 10% ) , oven-baked french fries ( 8% ) and breakfast cereals ( 8% ) .
Margins of exposure based on genotoxic benchmark dose limits were estimated to be low ( \u2248<100 ) in high-consumer adolescents , indicating the need to continue efforts to reduce dietary acrylamide exposure .
