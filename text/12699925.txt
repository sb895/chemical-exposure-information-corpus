The high levels of persistent organic pollutants have caused concern about human health , especially the health of the foetus and newborn child .
This has especially been the case for Greenlandic and Canadian Inuits , where elevated levels of PCB and p,p'-DDE have been reported .
In recent studies from arctic Russia the levels of beta-HCH and the DDT-group have been reported to be high , whereas the levels of PCB are low .
However , the information from Northern Russia is , so far , incomplete .
In this study , 27 delivering women from the city of Arkhangelsk , Russia , participated .
They completed a questionnaire before delivery and plasma samples were collected after delivery .
The analytical method developed to support this study involved gel permeation chromatography and silica gel purification , in addition to a traditional GC-MS method , and thus include acid labile compounds .
The arithmetic mean levels of p,p'-DDE , beta-HCH and p,p'-DDT were 5.42 , 3.59 and 1.17 microg/l , respectively .
Toxaphene 26 and 50 were the only toxaphenes above the limit of detection , with arithmetic mean levels of 0.05 and 0.09 microg/l , respectively .
Among the PCB congeners , PCB 138/163 was the most abundant with an arithmetic mean of 0.53 microg/l .
The elevated levels of beta-HCH and p,p'-DDT as well as a low DDE/DDT ratio is a strong indication of fresh and maybe local sources in this area .
