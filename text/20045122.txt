We investigated the mercury concentrations in red meat from pilot whales consumed by some residents of the Japanese whaling town , Taiji , and in hair samples from 50 residents for their maker of mercury burden .
The methyl mercury ( M-Hg ) level in the red meat was 5.9 microg/wet g , markedly higher than the US FDA action level and Cordex Alimentarius guideline level for predatory fish ( 1.0 microg/wet g ) .
The average level of total mercury ( T-Hg ) in the hair from residents who ate whale meat more than once a month was 24.6 microg/g , whereas the average from the residents who did not consume any whale meat was 4.3 microg/g .
The T-Hg concentrations in the hair from three donors exceeded 50 microg/g , the level for NOAEL set by WHO .
The T-Hg level found in the Taiji whale meat consumers was markedly higher than that observed in the Japanese population overall ( about 2 microg/g ) .
