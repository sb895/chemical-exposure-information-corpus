Chronic exposure to arsenic ( As ) causes significant human health effects , including various cancers and skin disorders .
Naturally elevated concentrations of As have been detected in the groundwater of Bangladesh .
Dietary intake and drinking water are the major routes of As exposure for humans .
The objectives of this study were to measure As concentrations in rice grain collected from households in As-affected villages of Bangladesh where groundwater is used for agricultural irrigation and to estimate the daily intake of As consumed by the villagers from rice .
The median and mean total As contents in 214 rice grain samples were 131 and 143 microg/kg , respectively , with a range of 2-557 microg/kg ( dry weight , dw ) .
Arsenic concentrations in control rice samples imported from Pakistan and India and on sale in Australian supermarkets were significantly lower ( p < 0.001 ) than in rice from contaminated areas .
Daily dietary intake of As from rice was 56.4 microg for adults ( males and females ) while the total daily intake of As from rice and from drinking water was 888.4 and 706.4 microg for adult males and adult females , respectively .
From our study , it appears that the villagers are consuming a significant amount of As from rice and drinking water .
The results suggest that the communities in the villages studied are potentially at risk of suffering from arsenic-related diseases .
