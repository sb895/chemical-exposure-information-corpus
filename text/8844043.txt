Six Danish paper recycling plants were included in an assessment of exposure to chemicals .
A questionnaire on processes was completed , and in-plant industrial hygiene measurement data collected 1982-1994 were examined .
The assessment of chemicals did not reveal a major use of possible carcinogens , but acrylamide may have been released in the work environment in one plant .
A total of 197 hygiene measurements were recorded : 126 in the largest plant .
Airborne concentrations of dust , microorganisms , and endotoxins varied widely between plants .
High concentrations of dust were recorded in the paper machine area in one plant and in the repulping unit in another plant .
In general , endotoxin levels were low , but endotoxin levels were increased in one plant when reuse of process water was intensified .
Changes in procedures should be assessed by industrial hygiene measurements .
