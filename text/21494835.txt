Human milk is usually the only source of food for infants during the first 4 to 5months of their life .
Maternal environmental mercury exposure is directly related to fish consumption or amalgam filling .
In this research , 38 human milk samples were collected from mothers of Lenjan area who were not occupationally exposed with mercury .
Mercury concentration in human milk was determined by AMA254 Mercury Analyzer .
A level of mercury was examined in relation to somatometric , demographic and dental amalgam parameters .
Obtained results showed that only dental amalgam significantly increased the mercury level in human milk ( p\u2009< 0.001 ) .
The mean mercury concentrations in milk of mothers without teeth fillings ( n\u2009= 13 ) , with one to three teeth fillings ( n\u2009= 10 ) , and four to eight teeth fillings ( n\u2009= 15 ) were 2.87 , 5.47 , and 13.33\u03bcg/l , respectively .
The result of this study also showed a positive correlation of mercury milk levels with the number of teeth fillings of the mother ( p\u2009< 0.05 , r\u2009= 0.755 ) .
The estimated weekly intake of mercury of a breastfed infant in this study was , in some cases , higher than provisional tolerance weekly intake recommended by FAO/WHO , which pose a threat to their health .
