Bisphenol A ( BPA ) , an estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical , has been reported to affect embryos and alter their postnatal development .
In the present study , we measured the concentrations of BPA in human colostrum by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) with the aim of understanding the present status of BPA burden in human breast milk in Shizuoka , Japan .
Human colostral samples were collected from 101 healthy mothers within three days after delivery .
The BPA concentrations of colostral samples were estimated by ELISA after the acetonitrile extraction and solid phase extraction column purification .
BPA in 101 samples was detected in the concentration range of 1-7 ng ml(-1) .
The mean concentration of BPA was 3.41+/-0.13 ( mean+/-SD ) ng ml(-1) .
This is the first demonstration as to what BPA concentrations are in human colostrum .
The BPA concentrations in colostrum were higher than those in blood sera samples obtained from healthy women in a previous study .
In our study , there was no significant correlation between the concentrations of BPA in colostrum and the age and parity of mothers .
