OBJECTIVES Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are considered probable human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and one congener , PCB126 , has been rated as a known human carcinogen .
A period-specific job exposure matrix ( JEM ) was developed for former PCB-exposed capacitor manufacturing workers ( n=12,605 ) ( 1938-1977 ) .
METHODS A detailed exposure assessment for this plant was based on a number of exposure determinants ( proximity , degree of contact with PCBs , temperature , ventilation , process control , job mobility ) .
The intensity and frequency of PCB exposures by job for both inhalation and dermal exposures , and additional chemical exposures were reviewed .
The JEM was developed in nine steps : ( 1 ) all unique jobs ( n=1,684 ) were assessed using ( 2 ) defined PCB exposure determinants ; ( 3 ) the exposure determinants were used to develop exposure profiles ; ( 4 ) similar exposure profiles were combined into categories having similar PCB exposures ; ( 5 ) qualitative intensity ( high-medium-low-baseline ) and frequency ( continuous-intermittent ) ratings were developed , and ( 6 ) used to qualitatively rate inhalation and dermal exposure separately for each category ; ( 7 ) quantitative intensity ratings based on available air concentrations were developed for inhalation and dermal exposures based on equal importance of both routes of exposure ; ( 8 ) adjustments were made for overall exposure , and ( 9 ) for each category the product of intensity and frequency was calculated , and exposure in the earlier era was weighted .
RESULTS A period-specific JEM modified for two eras of stable PCB exposure conditions .
CONCLUSIONS These exposure estimates , derived from a systematic and rigorous use of the exposure determinant data , lead to cumulative PCB exposure-response relationships in the epidemiological cancer mortality and incidence studies of this cohort .
