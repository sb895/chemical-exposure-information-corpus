Cd , Zn , Cu , and metallothionein ( MT ) levels have been determined in the renal cortex and liver of 70 persons who died in Lodz and its surroundings in the years 1985-1989 .
The mean concentrations were : 44.9±28.6 µg Cd/g , 52.0±16.7 µg Zn/g , 2.4±1.0 µg Cu/g , 0.79±0.40 µmol Hg/g , and 3.5±1.8 µg Cd/g , 66.7±30.5 µg Zn/g , 4.9±2.1 µg Cu/g , 0.50±0.38 µmol Hg/g wet tissue in renal cortex and liver , respectively , with mean age 54.0±13.8 .
Smokers showed 2.4 times higher levels of Cd in the renal cortex than non-smokers .
The mean body burden of Cd was 33.4±17.3 mg .
Smoking increases it twofold from 22.0 mg in non-smokers to 41.8 mg in smokers .
