OBJECTIVE Many drugs are vestibulotoxic and may impair balance .
Styrene is both ototoxic and neurotoxic , but its effect on balance has been little studied .
We evaluate the effect of low concentrations of styrene on balance among Finnish fiberglass-reinforced plastic boat manufacturers .
METHODS From 252 male employees , we measured postural stability and urine mandelic and phenylglycolic acid concentrations .
Individual exposure to styrene in breathing zone was measured for 148 workers .
For analysis , 88 matched pairs were selected .
RESULTS The postural stability of laminators was aggravated compared with nonlaminators .
This impairment was observed in young workers , and it worsened with age .
CONCLUSIONS This study documents styrene as an additional risk factor in impaired postural stability , with the negative effects of the styrene exposure starting already in younger workers .
