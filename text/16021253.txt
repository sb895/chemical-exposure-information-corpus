The nervous system can be damaged when the population is exposed to methyl mercury ( MeHg ) by ingesting fish , and children deserve special attention due to their increased susceptibility as compared to adults .
A comparative cross-sectional study was performed in order to investigate the use of a battery of neurological development tests in two groups of 209 riverine children from 3 to 7 years old : a group exposed to moderate levels of MeHg ( n = 75 ) and a control group ( n = 134 ) .
The study included a questionnaire , the collection of scalp hair samples for determination of total mercury concentration , and performance on a test for evaluating neurological function in children .
Riverine children presented higher exposure to MeHg ( mean hair Hg = 5.37 +/- 3.35 microg x g(-1) ) in comparison to the control group ( mean Hg = 2.08 +/- 1.37 microg x g(-1) ) .
Both groups showed a high proportion of children with what was considered " non-normal " performance , suggesting that the results could not be related to mercury exposure and that this type of test presented limitations for use with river-dwelling Amazon communities .
