New findings on Bisphenol A ( BPA ) contents in thermal printing papers , and receipts , in g/kg concentrations and on its dermal uptake ( up to 60% ) prompted us to assess the risk arising from dermal exposure .
Using physiologically based toxicokinetic modelling , we simulated concentrations in blood , in liver and kidney , the target organs exhibiting the lowest no observed adverse effect levels ( NOAEL ) .
By comparing organ concentrations at the dose level of the NOAEL divided by a safety factor of 100 ( liver : 50\u03bcg/kg/day ; kidney : 500\u03bcg/kg/day ) , with concentrations arising from the dermal dose of 0.97\u03bcg/kg/day ( worst case assumption by Biedermann et al. , 2010 ) this dermal exposure can be assumed safe .
Additionally , based on the model simulations the high blood concentrations , reported earlier in the literature , are highly improbable because the related exposure levels are orders of magnitude higher than the currently estimated aggregate exposure levels .
