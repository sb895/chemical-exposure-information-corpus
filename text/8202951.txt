Biological monitoring of mercury ( Hg ) in blood , urine and hair was performed in volunteers with amalgam fillings , in subjects who consumed fish and in Hg-exposed workers .
It was found that both amalgam fillings and the consumption of fish burden the organism with Hg in the same order of magnitude .
The Hg concentrations in urine in the occupationally exposed group were higher by a factor of about 100 compared to the group with amalgam fillings .
No pathological changes were found in the exposed workers .
It seems safe to conclude that no health-related problems from Hg are to be expected from amalgam fillings .
