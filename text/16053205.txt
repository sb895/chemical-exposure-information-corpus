The effect of blood cadmium ( Cd ) , which reflects not only Cd body burden but also recent Cd exposure and communicates with fetal blood in the placenta , on newborn size at birth was investigated .
Blood Cd of 55 mothers from Toyama , Japan , at 30-32 gestational weeks was measured using a flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer .
The relationship between blood Cd and newborn size was analyzed after adjustment for gestational age and maternal build .
A significant inverse correlation was found between infant height and maternal blood Cd .
After adjustment for gestational age and maternal weight at 30-32 gestational weeks , the significant inverse relationship between maternal blood Cd and infant height was shown using the multiple regression analysis .
Newborn size might be influenced by maternal blood Cd levels to which infants may be exposed during gestation .
