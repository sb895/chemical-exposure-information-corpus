The purpose of this study was to clarify the change and relationship of urinary cadmium ( Cd ) and beta(2)-microglobulin ( beta(2)-MG ) concentrations of inhabitants in Cd-polluted areas after soil restoration .
The urinary Cd and beta(2)-MG concentrations of 25 males and 28 females did not show a significant change , 22 years after the Cd-polluted soil was restored .
Once exposed to Cd , it was found to remain in the body , 22 years after the Cd -polluted soil was restored .
However , this did not influence renal tubular dysfunction in most of the younger generation compared with elders heavily exposed to Cd .
