BACKGROUND Although studies have found that diabetes mellitus ( DM ) modifies the impact of exposures from air pollution on cardiovascular outcomes , information is limited regarding DM as an air pollution-associated outcome .
OBJECTIVES Using two prospective cohorts , the Nurses ' Health Study ( NHS ) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study ( HPFS ) , we investigated the relationship of incident type 2 DM with exposures to particulate matter ( PM ) < 2.5 µm ( PM2.5 ) , PM < 10 µm ( PM10 ) , and PM between 2.5 and 10 µm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM10-2.5 ) in the previous 12 months and the distance to roadways .
METHODS Cases were reported and confirmed through biennial and supplemental questionnaires of diagnosis and treatment information .
During follow-up from 1989 to 2002 , questionnaires provided information on time-varying covariates and updated addresses .
Addresses were geocoded and used to assign air pollution exposures from spatiotemporal statistical models .
RESULTS Among participants living in metropolitan areas of the northeastern and midwestern United States , there were 3,784 incident cases of DM in the NHS , and 688 cases in the HPFS .
Pooled results from random effects meta-analysis of cohort-specific models adjusted for body mass index and other known risk factors produced hazard ratios ( HRs ) for incident DM with interquartile range ( IQR ) increases in average PM during the 12 months before diagnosis of 1.03 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.96-1.10 ] for PM2.5 , 1.04 ( 95% CI , 0.99-1.09 ) for PM10 , and 1.04 ( 95% CI , 0.99-1.09 ) for PM10-2.5 .
Among women , the fully adjusted HR for living < 50 m versus \u2265 200 m from a roadway was 1.14 ( 95% CI , 1.03-1.27 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Overall , results did not provide strong evidence of an association between exposure to PM in the previous 12 months and incident DM ; however , an association with distance to road ( a proxy marker of exposure to traffic-related pollution ) was shown among women .
