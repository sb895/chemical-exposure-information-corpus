Human primary teeth have been used as indicators of heavy metal exposure for several decades , but the knowledge about the influence of factors such as tooth type and the presence of caries and roots on metal concentrations is limited .
Samples of tooth powder from more than 1200 Norwegian primary teeth without fillings have been analyzed for lead , zinc and cadmium content , and 554 of them for mercury .
The material represents all groups of tooth types ( incisors , canines and molars ) , carious and non-carious teeth , and teeth with and without roots .
Here we investigate how tooth group and the presence of caries and roots are related to metal concentrations in the teeth .
We find that carious teeth have higher metal concentrations than non-carious teeth ; the difference was statistically significant for lead , mercury and zinc .
Teeth with roots have higher lead and zinc concentrations than teeth without roots .
We find differences in metal concentrations between the tooth groups for lead , mercury and zinc .
Significant , positive correlations are found between lead and the three other metals and between mercury and zinc .
We conclude that metal concentrations in primary teeth are affected by the presence of caries and roots and by tooth group .
