Inhalation exposure to haloacetic acids ( HAAs ) and haloketones ( HKs ) in contaminated drinking water occurs during showering .
The size distribution of the aerosols generated by a shower was determined using an eight size-range particle counter , which measured particles from 0.1 to >2 microm .
An exponential increase in aerosol numbers was observed while the shower water was on , while the aerosol numbers declined exponentially once the water was turned off .
The half-lives of the shower aerosols were longer than 5 min after the shower water was turned off .
Although the majority of the shower-generated aerosols were smaller than 0.3 microm , these aerosols only contributed approximately 2% to the measured total aerosol mass .
The total shower-generated particulate HAA and HK concentrations collected on an open face filter were approximately 6.3 and 0.13 microg/m3 , respectively , for shower water HAA and HK concentrations of 250 and 25 microg/L , respectively .
The vapor-phase HK concentrations were 25-50 microg/m3 .
The estimate of the dose from inhalation exposure of disinfection byproducts ( DBPs ) in the particulate phase indicate that they represent less than 1% of the ingestion dose , so inhalation is not expected to be an important exposure route to nonvolatile water contaminants or the portion of volatile DBPs that stay in the particulate phase , unless the lung is the target organ .
The vapor-phase levels of volatile HKs , though , are significantly higher and can contribute greater than 10% of the ingestion dose during a shower .
Thus , risk assessment to the these DBPs needs to consider the inhalation route .
