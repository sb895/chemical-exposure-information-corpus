Spanish gluten-free rice , cereals with gluten , and pureed baby foods were analysed for total ( t-As ) and inorganic As ( i-As ) using ICP-MS and HPLC-ICP-MS , respectively .
Besides , pure infant rice from China , USA , UK and Spain were also analysed .
The i-As contents were significantly higher in gluten-free rice than in cereals mixtures with gluten , placing infants with celiac disease at high risk .
All rice-based products displayed a high i-As content , with values being above 60% of the t-As content and the remainder being dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) .
Approximately 77% of the pure infant rice samples showed contents below 150\u03bcgkg(-1) ( Chinese limit ) .
When daily intake of i-As by infants ( 4-12months ) was estimated and expressed on a bodyweight basis ( \u03bcgd(-1)kg(-1) ) , it was higher in all infants aged 8-12months than drinking water maximum exposures predicted for adults ( assuming 1L consumption per day for a 10\u03bcgL(-1) standard ) .
