Pyrethroid insecticides have been applied in the production of cotton , wool and textile .
In order to examine whether textile workers are exposed to pyrethroid insecticides , we recruited 50 textile workers in two textile plants in Eastern China .
Their urine samples were collected for the measurement of pyrethroid metabolites : cis- and trans-isomers of 2,2-dichlorovinyl-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ( cis-Cl2CA and trans-Cl2CA ) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid ( 3-PBA ) .
Our results showed that textile workers were exposed to high levels of pyrethroid insecticides. cis-Cl2CA and 3-PBA were dominant metabolites with concentrations of 0.17-261\u03bcg/L , while concentrations of trans-Cl2CA were in the range of 0.26-11\u03bcg/L .
Levels of three metabolites were in a descending order : cis-Cl2CA , 3-PBA , and trans-Cl2CA .
Levels of the metabolites were associated with ages and job responsibilities of textile workers .
Sewing workers , cutting workers , machine operators , reorganizers , and older workers were more likely in contact with pyrethroid insecticides in the textile production. trans- to cis-Cl2CA ratios might indicate that exposure of textile workers was via dermal absorption and inhalation .
