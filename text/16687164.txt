It has been demonstrated that a group of workers ( e.g. waste handlers ) daily exposed to a traffic related air pollution present airway inflammation in term of an increase of neutrophilic inflammation .
The aim of our study was to determine the presence of airways inflammation detected by induced sputum in a population of traffic policemen ( TP ) in the city of Bari , compared to a group of healthy subjects ( HS ) without any occupational exposure to inhalation of traffic-related air pollution .
Twelve non smokers , non atopics , healthy traffic policemen with a history of exposure to airway pollution and 12 HS underwent sputum induction .
TP show a statistically significant increase in the percentage neutrophil cell count ( median and IQ range ) compared to the HS ( 65 and 13.5 vs. 40.5 and 9.5 ; p<0.01 ) .
In conclusion we have found that policemen chronically exposed to air pollution presented airway neutrophilic inflammation and the results of this pilot study could be strictly considered for the long term effect of a traffic pollution in airway inflammation and the lung function .
