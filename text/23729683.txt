Although respiratory disease has been strongly connected to fine particulate air pollution ( particulate matter <2.5 \u03bcm in diameter ( PM2.5) ) , evidence has been mixed regarding the effects of coarse particles ( particulate matter from 2.5 to 10 \u03bcm in diameter ) , possibly because of the greater spatial heterogeneity of coarse particles .
In this study , we evaluated the relationship between coarse particles and respiratory emergency department visits , including common subdiagnoses , from 2005 to 2008 in 35 California counties .
A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to help control for time-invariant confounders and seasonal influences , and the study population was limited to those residing within 20 km of pollution monitors to mitigate the influence of spatial heterogeneity .
Significant associations between respiratory emergency department visits and coarse particle levels were observed .
Asthma visits showed associations ( for 2-day lag , excess risk per 10 μg/m³ = 3.3% , 95% confidence interval : 2.0 , 4.6 ) that were robust to adjustment by other common air pollutants ( particles <2.5 \u03bcm in diameter , ozone , nitrogen dioxide , carbon monoxide , and sulfur dioxide ) .
Pneumonia and acute respiratory infection visits were not associated , although some suggestion of a relationship with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visits was present .
Our results indicate that coarse particle exposure may trigger asthma exacerbations requiring emergency care , and reducing exposures among asthmatic persons may provide benefits .
