To investigate whether children's nutritional status , especially the extent of wasting [ acute malnutrition as measured by weight-for-height Z ( WHZ ) score ] is associated with arsenic contamination of drinking water , a survey was carried out in two discrete rural areas located less than 30 km southeast and northeast of Dhaka , the capital of Bangladesh. 761 children between 7 and 14 years of age were randomly selected , one child per household .
The arsenic concentration in the tube well water used by each child and the prevalence and intensity of infection of three geo-helminths [ Ascaris lumbricoides , Trichuris trichiura and hookworm ( Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus) ] were determined .
Each child had their height and weight measured and WHZ score determined using the World Health Organization ( WHO ) reference values .
Basic socio-demographic data and knowledge of arsenic poisoning were collected using a questionnaire. 62.2% of the households studied were using well water with arsenic concentrations above the 0.01 mg/L WHO guideline ( i.e. arsenic-contaminated households ) .
The mean WHZ score of all the 761 children was -0.843 ( sd 1.227 ) but children living in contaminated households were significantly more wasted than children living in noncontaminated households ( mean difference = -0.361 , p 0.001 ) .
When the effects of the differences in socio-economic status and prevalence of geo-helminths were also taken into account , the difference in means remained highly significant ( -0.330 , p = 0.006 ) .
This study suggests that arsenic contamination has a negative impact on children's acute nutritional status .
