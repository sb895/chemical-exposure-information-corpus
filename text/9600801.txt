Suriname is experiencing a revival of small scale gold mining activities , with about 10,000 to 15,000 workers involved in 1996 .
The estimated production in 1995 is at least 10,000 kg crude gold .
Gold is extracted with mercury and methods used are comparable with those described for gold mining in the Amazon Basin .
Since no data exist on the internal mercury exposure of workers in Suriname a study was performed .
A group of mercury-exposed Maroons , who are principally involved in the mining located in the tropical rainforest , is compared with nonexposed Maroons living in a non-gold mining area .
Blood and urine samples of both groups were analyzed for total mercury using an atomic absorption spectrometer with an FIAS hydride system .
In the study 28 exposed and 17 controls with a comparable mean age ( P=0.544 ; exposed 27+/-7.2 years , n=26 ; controls 26+/-7.7 years , n=17 ) , all males , participated .
The urine levels for both groups differ statistically significantly from each other ( P<0.001 ; exposed mean 27.5+/-21.1 microg/g creatinine ; controls mean 5. 2+/-2.9 microg/g creatinine ) .
This is , however , not the case with the blood levels ( P=0.036 : exposed mean 18.1+/-11.0 microg/L , n=25 ; controls mean 26.8+/-14.6 microg/L , n=16 ) .
In contrast with blood the urine total mercury levels in this study confirm , on a group basis , exposure to mercury as described for individuals working in the gold mining in the Amazon Basin .
