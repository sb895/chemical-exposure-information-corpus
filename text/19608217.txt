This study was performed to explore possible environmental risk factors , including indoor chemicals , mold , and dust mite allergens , which could cause sick building syndrome ( SBS)-type symptoms in new houses .
The study was conducted in 2004 and 2005 and the final study population consisted of 86 men and 84 women residing in Okayama , Japan .
The indoor concentrations of indoor aldehydes , volatile organic compounds , airborne fungi , and dust mite allergens in their living rooms were measured and the longitudinal changes in two consecutive years were calculated .
A standardized questionnaire was used concomitantly to gather information on frequency of SBS-type symptoms and lifestyle habits .
About 10% of the subjects suffered from SBS in the both years .
Crude analyses indicated tendencies for aldehyde levels to increase frequently and markedly in the newly diseased and ongoing SBS groups .
Among the chemical factors and molds examined , increases in benzene and in Aspergillus contributed to the occurrence of SBS in the logistic regression model .
Indoor chemicals were the main contributors to subjective symptoms associated with SBS .
A preventive strategy designed to lower exposure to indoor chemicals may be able to counter the occurrence of SBS .
