Trivalent chromium [ Cr(III) ] is widely used in tanning industrial processes .
The population living in tanning industrial area is continuously exposed to Cr(III) which appears to be associated with both acute and chronic health problems .
Therefore , the aim of this study was to evaluate the health risk with special reference to oxidative stress parameters ( malondialdehyde - MDA , glutathione - GSH , and superoxide dismutase - SOD ) and DNA damage in 100 Cr-exposed and 100 unexposed populations .
The total blood Cr level , SOD level , MDA level and DNA damage were significantly ( p<0.05 ) higher and GSH level was significantly ( p<0.05 ) lower in exposed group as compared to the unexposed group .
The altered oxidative stress parameters and DNA damage were found to be slightly higher in female population of both groups .
In simple and multiple correlation analyses ( adjusted with potential confounders ) , blood Cr level showed negative significant correlation with GSH level and positive significant correlation with level of MDA , SOD and DNA damage in both groups .
The overall prevalence of morbidity was found to be significantly ( p<0.05 ) higher in the exposed group as compared to the unexposed group .
In the exposed group , the prevalence of respiratory illness is highest , followed by diabetes , gastrointestinal tract problems and dermal problems respectively .
Our results concluded that the Cr(III) exposed population is at high risk for health hazards and the female population is slightly more susceptible to Cr(III) exposure .
