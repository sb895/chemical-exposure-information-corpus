Herbal tea is consumed widely in China due to their therapeutic efficacy , mild features , and relatively low cost .
To assess the health risk associated with drinking herbal tea , arsenic and seven heavy metals , namely Cu , Zn , Fe , Mn , Cd , Ni , and Pb in eight different types of herbal flowers and their infusions were determined by inductively coupled-mass spectrometry after microwave digestion .
The accuracy and precision of the analytical method were confirmed by the certified reference material ( GBW 07605 ) .
The results suggested that significant differences existed in all metal concentrations determined among different varieties of herbal flowers and their infusions .
In general , the concentration of iron was higher than those of seven other metals in the investigated herbal flowers and their infusions .
The hazard quotient ( HQ ) and hazard index ( HI ) were calculated to evaluate the noncarcinogenic health risk from individual metal and combined metals due to the dietary intakes via consumption of herbal infusions .
Both the HQ and HI levels were far below one , suggesting that the dietary intakes of the eight metals determined from daily consumption 4.5 g of the investigated herbal flowers for a normal adult should pose no potential risk to human health .
