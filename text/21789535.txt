Atmospheric particulate and gaseous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) samples were collected from an urban area in Dokki ( Giza ) during the summer of 2007 and the winter of 2007-2008 .
The average concentrations of PAHs were 1,429.74 ng/m(3) in the particulate phase , 2,912.56 ng/m(3) in the gaseous phase , and 4,342.30 ng/m(3) in the particulate\u2009+\u2009gaseous phases during the period of study .
Dokki has high level concentrations of PAH compounds compared with many polluted cities in the world .
The concentrations of PAH compounds in the particulate and gaseous phases were higher in the winter and lower in the summer .
Total concentrations of PAHs in the particulate phase and gaseous phase were 22.58% and 77.42% in summer and 36.97% and 63.03% in winter of the total ( particulate\u2009+\u2009gaseous ) concentrations of PAHs , respectively .
The gaseous/particulate ratios of PAHs concentration were 3.43 in summer and 1.71 in winter .
Significant negative correlation coefficients were found between the ambient temperature and concentrations of the total PAHs in the particulate and gaseous phases .
The distribution of individual PAHs and different categories of PAHs based on aromatic ring number in the particulate and gaseous phases during the summer and winter were nearly similar , indicating similar emission sources of PAHs in both two seasons .
Benzo(b)fluoranthene in the particulate phase and naphthalene in the gaseous phase were the most abundant compounds .
Diagnostic concentration ratios of PAH compounds indicate that these compounds are emitted mainly from pyrogenic sources , mainly local vehicular exhaust emissions .
Health risks associated with the inhalation of individual PAHs in particulate and gaseous phases were assessed on the basis of its benzo(a)pyrene equivalent concentration .
Dibenzo(a,h)anthracene and benzo(a)pyrene in the particulate phase and benzo(a)pyrene and benzo(a)anthracene in the gaseous phase were the greatest contributors to the total health risks .
The relative mean contributions of the total carcinogenic activity ( concentrations ) of all PAHs to the total concentrations of PAHs were 29.37% and 25.15% in the particulate phase and 0.76% and 0.92% in the gaseous phase during the summer and winter , respectively .
These results suggest that PAHs in the particulate phase in the ambient air of Dokki may pose a potential health risk .
