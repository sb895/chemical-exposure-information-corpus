The total mercury ( T-Hg ) and methyl mercury ( Me-Hg ) concentrations in the hair were measured to evaluate mercury ( Hg ) exposure for the residents in Da-shui-xi Village ( DSX ) and Xia-chang-xi Village ( XCX ) in the Wanshan Hg mining area , Guizhou Province , Southwestern China .
The mean concentrations in the hair of DSX residents were 5.5 ± 2.7 \u03bcg/g and 1.9 ± 0.9 \u03bcg/g for T-Hg and Me-Hg , respectively .
The concentrations in the hair of XCX residents were 3.3 ± 1.4 \u03bcg/g and 1.2 ± 0.5 \u03bcg/g for T-Hg and Me-Hg , respectively .
Hair Me-Hg concentrations were significantly correlated to T-Hg ( r = 0.42 , P < 0.01 ) in the two sites ; on average , hair Me-Hg concentration accounted for 40 and 44% of T-Hg for DSX and XCX residents , respectively .
Age has no obvious correlation with hair Hg and the hair Hg levels showed a significant gender difference , with higher T-Hg and Me-Hg concentrations in the hair from males than females .
The rice collected from the two sites showed high levels of T-Hg and Me-Hg concentration .
The results indicated a certain Hg exposure for the residents in DSX and XCX in the Wanshan Hg mining area .
