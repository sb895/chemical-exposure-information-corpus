BACKGROUND Epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease risk factors and appropriate biomarkers in populations exposed to a wide range of arsenic levels are a public health research priority .
OBJECTIVE We investigated the relationship between inorganic arsenic exposure from drinking water and plasma levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 ) and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 ( sVCAM-1 ) , both markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation , in an arsenic-exposed population in Araihazar , Bangladesh .
METHODS The study participants included 115 individuals with arsenic-related skin lesions participating in a 2 x 2 randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial of vitamin E and selenium supplementation .
Arsenic exposure status and plasma levels of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were assessed at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up .
RESULTS Baseline well arsenic , a long-term measure of arsenic exposure , was positively associated with baseline levels of both sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 and with changes in the two markers over time .
At baseline , for every 1-mug/L increase in well arsenic there was an increase of 0.10 ng/mL [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.00-0.20 ] and 0.33 ng/mL ( 95% CI , 0.15-0.51 ) in plasma sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 , respectively .
Every 1-microg/L increase in well arsenic was associated with a rise of 0.11 ng/mL ( 95% CI , 0.01-0.22 ) and 0.17 ng/mL ( 95% CI , 0.00-0.35 ) in sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 from baseline to follow-up , respectively , in spite of recent changes in urinary arsenic as well as vitamin E and selenium supplementation during the study period .
CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate an effect of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water on vascular inflammation that persists over time and also suggest a potential mechanism underlying the association between arsenic exposure and cardiovascular disease .
