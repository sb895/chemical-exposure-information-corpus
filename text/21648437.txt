For the first time , the exposure of swimmers and workers to haloacetic acids ( HAAs ) in indoor and outdoor pools was evaluated through the analysis of urine samples .
The subjects of this study , 49 volunteers , were male and female workers as well as swimmers ( adults and children ) who regularly attended an indoor pool ( January-June ) and an outdoor one ( July and August ) .
The results showed that HAAs appeared 20-30 min after exposure and were eliminated within 3 h .
After 2 h exposure , urine samples taken from workers contained dichloroacetic ( DCAA ) and trichloroacetic ( TCAA ) acids at and ng/L levels since HAAs were aerosolized in the indoor ambient , whereas only DCAA was found in some workers ' urine samples from the outdoor pool but at ng/L levels , despite the fact that the outdoor pools generally had somewhat higher levels of HAAs than the indoor pools .
After 1 h swimming TCAA , DCAA and MCAA were present at concentrations of and ng/L , respectively , in the swimmers ' urine in the indoor pool ; similar results were obtained from the swimmers in the outdoor pool due to accidental ingestion .
Finally , exposure estimates indicate that ingestion is the major route of exposure ( followed by inhalation ( and dermal contribution (
