Cadmium ( Cd ) , a known human carcinogen , is one of the components of tobacco and also has many industrial uses .
Smoking Cd-contaminated cigarettes at work may cause an increase in blood levels and toxicity of Cd .
For a population of nonexposed workers , we compared blood Cd and urine cotinine ( Cot ) levels as biological markers of exposure to cigarette smoke of active smokers ( AS ) and passive smokers ( PS ) with those of unexposed nonsmokers ( UNS ) in 158 workers .
The mean Cd in AS ( 0.097 microgram% ; ie , 0.097 microgram/100 mL whole blood ) was significantly higher than in UNS ( 0.085 microgram% ) , and was very close to the mean Cd levels in PS ( 0.093 microgram% ) .
Mean Cd levels in exposed past smokers ( 0.105 microgram% was higher than in nonexposed past smokers ( P < 0.05 ) and in AS .
The mean Cot level was significantly higher in AS than in PS or in UNS .
Increased smoking was associated directly with increased blood Cd and urine Cot .
Our results supported and proved quantitatively that exposure to cigarette smoke is harmful to both AS and PS , as we show that in both cases there is an increase in blood Cd .
According to our results , exposure to cigarette smoke via active and passive smoking increases blood Cd by an average of 0.01 micrograms% over the background ( UNS ) .
We conclude that exposure to cigarette smoke is a confounder to be taken into account when carrying out epidemiological studies and surveillance programs on workers exposed to Cd at work .
