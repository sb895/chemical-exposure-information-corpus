This research focuses on the metallurgy and underground mining job positions in the historic mines of Almaden ( Spain ) .
We introduce a preventive methodology for hydrargyrism in work environments known by the name of Methodology for Operational Units Action Levels for Health Indicators ( MUONAIS ) .
The methodology allows critical levels to be established using environmental and clinical-biological indicators .
The prevention plan concentrated on 15 job positions in the metallurgy department that employed more than 100 workers between the years 1986 and 1997 .
The development of this preventive methodology managed to keep workers ' mercury levels below 60 \u03bcg/l in blood and 200 \u03bcg/l in urine , values that present no negative effects on human health .
MUONAIS has proven very effective in protecting workers ' health .
During this period , some cases of micro-mercurialism were detected , yet were completely reversible , allowing us to affirm that the terrible disease of hydrargyrism was totally eradicated .
