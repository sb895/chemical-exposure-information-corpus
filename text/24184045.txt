A sampling campaign from 21 sites in Italy was carried out to investigate the presence of organochlorine pesticide residues in different fish species .
Samples came from marine fishery and either from sea- or freshwater aquaculture .
Fish feed used in some fish farms were also analyzed .
Pesticides studied belong to Persistent Organic Pollutants widely used in the past such as DDT , chlordane , heptachlor , and others .
To ensure good quality results and proper data validation the main existing guidelines in the field were applied .
The instrumental technique was a Dual column-Dual detector Gas Chromatography ( GC-ECD and Ion Trap GC-MS ) which allowed that complementary data on the same sample were acquired .
Results for fishery showed a wide range of concentrations depending from the area and species examined .
DDT , the major OC pesticide detected , varied from 0.02 to 130.03 ng g(-1) edible portion .
As regards the products of aquaculture we observed slightly lower average levels of pollutants in a more narrow range of concentration : this is probably due to fish feed used as shown by some measures performed in the present study .
Organochlorine pesticide residues were detected in all samples examined but they were generally well below the existing tolerance or action levels .
Also the estimated daily intakes are well below than those recommended by WHO .
This is a good indication about OCPs in the areas investigated but some further considerations on fish safety must be taken into account .
An example on how fishes may act as bioindicators is reported .
