Workers at an electronics recycling plant have previously been shown to have elevated serum levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) compared to referents without occupational PBDE exposure .
Subsequent structural changes and industrial hygiene measures at the plant were applied to improve the work environment .
The present study aims to assess the impact of these work environment changes on the occupational exposure to PBDEs .
Blood were drawn from the workers and analyzed at two different laboratories , and serum concentrations of several PBDE congeners were determined by GC/MS or GC/HRMS .
Cross-sectional studies were performed prior to ( in 1997 ; N=19 ) and after ( in 2000 ; N=27 ) workplace improvements .
Longitudinal studies were performed on twelve of the workers that were sampled at both occasions .
Even though the amount of processed goods had doubled in 2000 as compared to 1997 , there was a significant decrease in the serum levels of BDE-183 and BDE-209 .
For BDE-209 the levels observed in year 2000 were even lower than in referents with no occupational exposure .
In contrast to the decrease of higher brominated diphenyl ethers , the concentrations of BDE-47 did not significantly change .
For BDE-153 , the cross-sectional study indicated no change , whereas the longitudinal follow up indicated a significant increase .
This study shows that the industrial hygiene improvements clearly reduced the occupational exposure to BDE-183 and BDE-209 at the plant .
Still , the levels of hexa- to nonaBDEs but not BDE-209 were elevated , compared to referents with no occupational exposure .
