Human hair samples ( n=42 ) from Iassy county ( Eastern Romania ) collected in 2002-2003 from adolescents were analyzed for hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) isomers , p,p'-DDT and its metabolites , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , chlordane and metabolites and 5 polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) congeners .
Very low levels were found for HCB and oxychlordane ( 0.8 and 2.5 ng g(-1) ) indicating a low usage of these pesticide formulations in the studied area .
In case of HCHs , gamma-HCH isomer was measured at higher median concentrations ( 79 ng g(-1) hair ) compared to the beta-HCH isomer ( 55 ng g(-1) ) , which generally is the most prevalent from HCHs .
The DDTs profile consisted in p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT which levels correspond to 81% of sum DDTs .
Very high median concentrations measured for p,p'-DDT ( 192 ng g(-1) ) combined with lower values for p,p'-DDE/p,p'-DDT of 0.4 ( from 0.20 to 2.0 ) in all hair samples suggest recent exposure to " fresh " DDT .
When gender was considered , significantly higher concentrations for most of the investigated contaminants were found in girls hair compared to boys .
Very high levels were found in the present study for HCHs and DDTs compared to samples from Greece , Western Europe and China .
In case of PCBs , the levels found in Romanian samples were found to be in the same range compared to other previously published data .
