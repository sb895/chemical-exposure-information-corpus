Thyroid hormones play a critical role in the growth of many organs , especially the brain .
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) interact with the thyroid pathway and may disturb neurodevelopment .
This prospective study was designed to examine associations between maternal blood PBDEs and PCBs in early pregnancy and levels of thyroid hormones in maternal and umbilical-cord blood .
Levels of low-brominated PBDEs , 3 PCB congeners , total and free thyroid hormones ( triiodothyronine ( T3 ) and thyroxine ( T4) ) , thyroid-stimulating hormone , thyroid peroxidase antibodies , iodine , selenium , and mercury were measured in 380 pregnant women in the first trimester who were recruited at the University Hospital Center of Sherbrooke ( Quebec , Canada ) between September 2007 and December 2008 .
Thyroid hormone levels were also assessed at delivery and in cord blood ( n = 260 ) .
Data were analyzed on both a volume basis and a lipid basis .
At less than 20 weeks of pregnancy , no relationship was statistically significant in volume-based analysis .
In lipid-based models , an inverse association between maternal PBDEs and total T3 and total T4 and a direct association with free T3 and free T4 were observed .
At delivery , in both analyses , we observed negative associations between maternal total T4 , free T3 , cord-blood free T4 , and PBDEs and between maternal free T3 and PCBs .
Our results suggest that exposure to PBDEs and PCBs in pregnancy may interfere with thyroid hormone levels .
