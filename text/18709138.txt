BACKGROUND One problem of interpreting population-based biomonitoring data is the reconstruction of corresponding external exposure in cases where no such data are available .
OBJECTIVES We demonstrate the use of a computational framework that integrates physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) modeling , Bayesian inference , and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to obtain a population estimate of environmental chloroform source concentrations consistent with human biomonitoring data .
The biomonitoring data consist of chloroform blood concentrations measured as part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) , and for which no corresponding exposure data were collected .
METHODS We used a combined PBPK and shower exposure model to consider several routes and sources of exposure : ingestion of tap water , inhalation of ambient household air , and inhalation and dermal absorption while showering .
We determined posterior distributions for chloroform concentration in tap water and ambient household air using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Total Exposure Assessment Methodology ( TEAM ) data as prior distributions for the Bayesian analysis .
RESULTS Posterior distributions for exposure indicate that 95% of the population represented by the NHANES III data had likely chloroform exposures < or = 67 microg/L [ corrected ] in tap water and < or = 0.02 microg/L in ambient household air .
CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate the application of computer simulation to aid in the interpretation of human biomonitoring data in the context of the exposure-health evaluation-risk assessment continuum .
These results should be considered as a demonstration of the method and can be improved with the addition of more detailed data .
