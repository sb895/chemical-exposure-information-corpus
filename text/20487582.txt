Maternal seafood intake is of great health interest since it constitutes an important source of n-3 fatty acids , but provides also an important pathway for fetal exposure to Hg .
The objective of the present study was to determine associations between Hg contamination and both maternal seafood consumption and fetal growth in French pregnant women .
Pregnant women included in the ' EDEN mother-child ' cohort study answered FFQ on their usual diet in the year before and during the last 3 months of pregnancy , from which frequencies of seafood intake were evaluated .
Total hair-Hg level was determined for the first 691 included women .
Associations between Hg level , seafood intake and several neonatal measurements were studied using linear regressions adjusted for confounding variables .
The median Hg level for mothers was 0.52 \u03bcg/g .
Maternal seafood intake was associated with Hg level ( r 0.33 ; P < 0.0001 ) .
There was no association between Hg level and fetal growth in the whole sample of women , except for an early negative relationship with biparietal diameter .
A positive association was found between seafood intake and fetal growth in overweight women only which remained unchanged after adjustment for Hg level ( birth weight : +101 g for a difference of 1 sd in seafood consumption ; P = 0.008 ) .
Although seafood intake was associated with Hg contamination in French pregnant women , the contamination level was low .
There was no consistent association between Hg level and fetal growth .
Taking into account Hg level did not modify associations between seafood intake and fetal growth .
