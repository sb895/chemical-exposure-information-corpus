An ecological assessment is performed by using a data bank of air , soil , vegetation and biology data from the area of a capacitor plant in Serpukhov , Russia .
Over a number of years the use of PCBs for filling capacitors has brought about environmental contamination beyond the plant's sanitary zone , in particular along a stream where vegetables and berries are grown commercially .
A correlation has been found between abnormally high concentrations of PCBs in breast milk of women living in the proximity of the plant and the occurrence of diathesis in babies .
A number of remedial measures have been developed in conjunction with the city's sanitary service .
