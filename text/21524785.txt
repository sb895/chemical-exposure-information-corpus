Mercury exposure of the local population was assessed in two areas of the Almadén mercury mining district , Spain , which has been the world's largest producer of this element .
Two groups , who are exposed to different sources of mercury , from a point source in Almadén and a diffuse source hundreds of kilometres away in the same region , were studied .
Total mercury ( THg ) in human hair ranged from 0.20 to 9.35 mg kg(-1) and the mean value was 2.64 mg kg(-1) .
About 87% of subjects had THg levels in excess of the EPA reference dose ( RfD=1.0 mg kg(-1) ) , while a high percentage ( 68% ) of them live in Almadén .
There was a clear increase in hair Hg with reported fish consumption and the highest mean hair mercury level was 4 times the RfD in a group who had reported the highest consumption of fish .
For the whole group , there was a significant effect of age , gender and fish consumption in relation to Hg concentration in the hair .
Nevertheless , when both groups were tested separately by means of a multivariate regression model , there was significant exposure in those living near the mine area .
Several factors such as age , gender and fish consumption remained statistically significant and were associated with THg .
The main conclusion is that people living close to the hot spot are more impacted by mercury than people living further away .
The intake of Hg through consumption of fish is an important parameter for Hg exposure ; however , in the case of people living close to the hot spot , their levels are related to the highly Hg-impacted living environment .
