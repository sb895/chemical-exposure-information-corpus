The Bolivian Altiplano ( Highlands ) region is subject to intense mining , tailing and smelting activities since centuries because of the presence of large and unique polymetallic ore deposits ( Ag , Au , Cu , Pb , Sn , Sb , Zn ) .
A large scale PM(10) , PM(2.5) aerosol monitoring survey was conducted during the dry season in one of the largest mining cities of this region ( Oruro , 200,000 inhabitants ) .
Aerosol fractions , source distribution and transport were investigated for 23 elements at approximately 1 km(2) scale resolution , and compared to children exposure data obtained within the same geographical space .
As , Cd , Pb , Sb , W and Zn in aerosols are present at relatively high concentrations when compared to studies from other mining regions .
Arsenic exceeds the European council PM(10) guide value ( 6 ng/m(3) ) for 90% of the samples , topping 200 ng/m(3) .
Ag , As , Cd , Cu , Pb and Sb are present at significantly higher levels in the district located in the vicinity of the smelter zone .
At the city level , principal component analysis combined with the mapping of factor scores allowed the identification and deconvolution of four individual sources : i ) a natural magmatic source ( Co , Cs , Fe , K , Mn , Na , Rb and U ) originating from soil dust , resuspended by the traffic activity ; ii ) a natural sedimentary source ( Mg , Ca , Sr , Ba and Th ) resulting from the suspension of evaporative salt deposits located South ; iii ) an anthropogenic source specifically enriched in mined elements ( As , Cd , Cu , Pb , Sb and Zn ) mainly in the smelting district of the city ; and iv ) a Ni-Cr source homogenously distributed between the different city districts .
Enrichment factors for As , Cd and Sb clearly show the impact of smelting activities , particularly in the finest PM(2.5) fraction .
Comparison to children's hair metal contents collected in five schools from different districts shows a direct exposure to smelting activity fingerprinted by a unique trace elements pattern ( Ag , As , Cu , Pb , Sb ) .
