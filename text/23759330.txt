Natural , inorganic arsenic contamination of groundwater threatens the health of more than 100 million people worldwide , including residents of the densely populated river deltas of South and Southeast Asia .
Contaminated groundwater from tube wells in Cambodia was discovered in 2001 leading to the detection of the first cases of arsenicosis in 2006 .
The most affected area was the Kandal Province .
The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of arsenicosis in Cambodia based on acceptable criteria , and to investigate the use of hair arsenic as a biomarker not only for arsenicosis-related signs but also for associated symptoms .
A cross-sectional epidemiological study of 616 respondents from 3 purposely selected provinces within the Mekong River basin of Cambodia was conducted .
The Kandal Province was chosen as a high arsenic-contaminated area , while the Kratie Province and Kampong Cham Province were chosen as moderate and low arsenic-contaminated areas , respectively .
The most prevalent sign of arsenicosis was hypomelanosis with a prevalence of 14.5% among all respondents and 32.4% among respondents with a hair arsenic level of \u22651 \u03bcg/g .
This was followed by hyperkeratosis , hyperpigmentation and mee's lines .
Results also suggest a 1.0 \u03bcg/g hair arsenic level to be a practical cut off point for an indication of an arsenic contaminated individual .
This hair arsenic level , together with the presence of one or more of the classical signs of arsenicosis , seems to be a practical criteria for a confirmed diagnosis .
Based on these criteria , the overall prevalence of arsenicosis for all provinces was found to be 16.1% , with Kandal Province recording the highest prevalence of 35.5% .
This prevalence is comparatively high when compared to that of other affected countries .
The association between arsenicosis and the use of Chinese traditional medicine also needs further investigation .
