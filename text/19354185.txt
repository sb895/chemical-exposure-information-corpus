The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of highly mineralized drinking water on children's health .
To reveal a relationship of children's health to the chemical composition of portable water , two Kazan districts differing in the conditions of water supply and the mineral composition of the water were selected .
A total of 833 schoolchildren aged 7-9 years underwent a questionnaire survey and their objective status was examined .
Special methods were used to determine the urinary content of trace elements , such as copper , zinc , cadmium , and gross elements , such as calcium and magnesium , by performing atomic absorption spectrophotometry on an AAS-SA 10 MP apparatus .
