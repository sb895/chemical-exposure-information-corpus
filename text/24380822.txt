In the Flemish human biomonitoring programme FLEHS II ( 2007-2011 ) trace metals ( Cd , Pb , Cr , Ni , Cu , Mn , Tl , Sb , As and toxic relevant arsenic ) were analysed in the blood and urine of adolescents ( 14-15 years old ) in the reference population in Flanders and in areas of important industrial activities : Genk-Zuid and Menen .
After adjustment of the results for confounding factors , the adolescents living in Genk-Zuid had higher levels of Cr , Cu and Tl in blood , higher levels of Cd and toxic relevant arsenic ( TRA ) in urine , but lower levels of Ni in blood and Sb in urine compared to the reference population .
In Menen higher levels of Cd and Cu in urine , higher concentrations of Tl in blood but lower concentrations of Pb in blood and lower Ni , Sb and As in urine were found compared to the reference population .
For both the reference population and the hot spots the concentrations are within the ranges found in other countries .
Compared to the previous biomonitoring programme FLEHS I ( 2002-2006 ) a decrease in the concentrations of Cd and especially of Pb in blood was observed .
However , it cannot be excluded that differences between the two campaigns are partially due to different sampling strategies .
