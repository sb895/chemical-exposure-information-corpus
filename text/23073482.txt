Levels of eight potentially toxic heavy metals in indoor dust from homes and offices in Istanbul were investigated .
The concentrations of heavy metals in indoor dust from homes+office ranged from 62 to 1800 \u03bcgg(-1) for Cu , 3-200 \u03bcgg(-1) for Pb , 0.4-20 \u03bcgg(-1) for Cd , 210-2800 \u03bcgg(-1) for Zn , 2.8-460\u03bcgg(-1) for Cr , 8-1300\u03bcgg(-1) for Mn , 2.4-25\u03bcgg(-1) for Co , 120-2600\u03bcgg(-1) for Ni .
Results of the study were comparable to other studies conducted on indoor dust and street dust from a variety of cities globally .
Considering only ingestion + inhalation , the carcinogenic risk level of Cr for adults and children ( 3.7×10(-5) and 2.7×10(-5) ) in Istanbul was in the range of EPA's safe limits ( 1×10(-6) and 1×10(-4) ) , indicating that cancer risk of Cr due to exposure to indoor dust in Istanbul can be acceptable .
According to calculated Hazard Quotient ( HQ ) , for non-cancer effects , the ingestion of indoor dust appears to be the major route of exposure to the indoor dust that results in a higher risk for heavy metals , followed by dermal contact and inhalation pathways .
However , compared to ingestion and dermal contact exposure , exposure through inhalation is almost negligible .
Hazard Index ( HI ) values for all studied elements were lower than safe limit of 1 and this result suggested that none of the population groups would likely to experience potential health risk due to exposure to heavy metals from indoor dust in the study area .
