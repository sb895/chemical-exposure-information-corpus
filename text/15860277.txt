There is broad human exposure to estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals ( EDCs ) , but the data sets that exist are primarily for various environmental media such as food and water rather than the most relevant internal exposure .
We have detected various kind of EDC contamination in humans including dioxin and bisphenol A ( BPA ) widely used for the production of plastic products .
BPA was present in serum and follicular fluid at approximately 1-2 ng/ml , as well as in fetal serum and full-term amniotic fluid , confirming passage through the placenta .
An approximately five-fold higher concentration , 8.3+/-8.7 ng/ml , was revealed in amniotic fluid at 15-18 weeks of gestation , compared to other fluids showing increased exposure at the critical developmental period in humans .
Interestingly , serum BPA concentrations were significantly higher in normal men and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) compared with normal women possibly due to differences in the androgen-related metabolism of BPA .
These findings may provide some insight into the metabolism of EDCs in human and the pathophysiology of endocrine disorders such as PCOS .
Dioxin contamination in relationship to development of endometriosis is also discussed .
