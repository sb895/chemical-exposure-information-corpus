To assess mercury exposure and potential risk , total mercury ( THg-H ) and methylmercury ( MeHg-H ) in hair were studied in 160 adults .
The study group consisted of 60 individuals living in the north central coast of Venezuela .
A section of the area was known to be contaminated with mercury from a chlor-alkali plant installed near one of the tributary rivers of the Caribbean Sea .
The study group was selected from 4 inclusion criteria points .
The control group was composed of 100 individuals selected from Carabobo state with no known exposure to Hg .
A questionnaire was designed to collect demographic , health information , work activities and fish consumption habits .
Hair samples were analyzed for THg .
Samples with THg-H > 5 microg/g were also analyzed for MeHg .
The mean THg-H was 1.88 +/- 1.50 and 0.99 +/- 0.87 microg/g for the study and control groups , respectively .
The study group was statistically higher than control individuals , however , no statistical differences of THg-H were found between each of the 4 categories of both groups .
Mean MeHg-H value was 3.67 +/- 1.25 microg/g .
Associations were made between Hg-H and several variables .
No significant relationship was noted between Hg-H levels and clinical symptoms .
R analyses and t-tests were used to determine associations between questionnaire variables and THg-H .
The main predictors of THg-H levels in the study group were fish consumption and frequency .
As both groups presented relatively low values for THg-H and MeHg-H , the results of this study indicate that Hg exposure did not exceed safe levels .
However , a more in-depth exposure assessment should be conducted to more accurately assess this exposure , specifically in terms of Hg content in water and fish sampling .
