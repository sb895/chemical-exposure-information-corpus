The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) , as well as those of 18 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , including 12-dioxin like ( DL)-PCBs , were measured in foodstuffs randomly acquired in Catalonia ( Spain ) in November-December 2008 .
A total of 65 composite samples , belonging to various food groups were analyzed by HRGC/HRMS .
The dietary intakes of PCDD/Fs and PCBs were subsequently estimated for four age groups of the population of Catalonia : children , teenagers , adults , and seniors , which were in turn divided according to sex .
The highest dietary exposure to PCDD/Fs corresponded to fish and seafood ( 28.0% ) , dairy products ( 15.4% ) , and oils and fats ( 10.6% ) , while that of PCBs corresponded to fish and seafood ( 58.6% ) , and dairy products ( 8.9% ) .
In contrast , the lowest contributions of PCDD/Fs and PCBs corresponded to vegetables , fruits and pulses .
Concerning the sum of PCDD/Fs plus DL-PCBs , the current total intake expressed in pg WHO-TEQ/kg per day ( 0.60 ) showed a notable decreasing trend with respect to those found in previous surveys performed also in Catalonia in 2000 ( 3.51 ) and 2006 ( 1.12pg/kg per day ) .
The current dietary intake of PCDDs plus DL-PCBs is similar or lower than that recently reported in studies performed in a number of regions and countries .
