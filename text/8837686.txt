Damage to the microcirculation caused by high-dose ionizing radiation is well known but data concerning low-dose exposure are scant and contrasting .
We employed capillary microscopy to study dermal microcirculation damage resulting from occupational exposure to ionizing radiation doses lower than 5 rem/year ( maximum permissible dose in Italy ) .
We studied 145 physicians ( 60.7% radiologists , 33.8% orthopedic specialists , 5.5% cardiologists ) occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and a control group of 106 subjects in comparable but different occupations not exposed to ionizing radiation or to other skin hazards .
All subjects were administered a clinical protocol and underwent capillary microscopy of the fingernail-fold .
Capillary microscopy alterations were classified as absent , mild , moderate , marked and severe .
Our data confirm that occupational exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation can lead to morphological and functional alterations of the dermal microcirculation , which can be identified early by capillary microscopy .
