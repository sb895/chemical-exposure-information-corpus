This field study investigated mercury ( Hg ) levels in urine and hair of Andean children of indigenous Saraguro and Metizo gold miners in the Nambija , Ecuador gold mining settlement .
Spot samples of urine and hair samples were collected concurrently from 80 children each .
Urine samples were used to determine the inorganic Hg burden , while hair samples were used as an index of methylmercury ( MeHg ) exposure from consumption of Hg contaminated fish .
The mean level of Hg in urine ( HgU ) was 10.9 microg/L , and the mean level in hair ( HgH ) was 6.0 microg/g .
Regression analysis showed a significant association ( r = 0.404 , p = 0.0007 ) between matched HgU and HgH samples .
Mean HgU and HgU levels tended to be higher for children aged 6-14 years than for a younger group .
The wide range of Hg levels in the urine and hair of Andean children of gold miners may place them at risk for neurodevelopmental and learning disorders .
