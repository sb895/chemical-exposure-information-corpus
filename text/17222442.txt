In a certain area of Michalovce district in East Slovakia , heavy industrial pollution by polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) developed in 1955-1984 and very high PCB levels in environmental and human samples are still persisting .
Recently , a total of 2045 adults from this and the surrounding background pollution area have been examined using questionnaire data , thyroid volume by ultrasound ( ThV ) , urinary iodine and serum levels of 15 PCB congeners , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , 2,2'-2-bis(4-chlorobiphenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene ( DDE ) , 2,2'-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane ( DDT ) , alpha- , beta- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) , thyrotropin ( TSH ) , free thyroxine ( FT4 ) , anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies ( TPOab ) and fasting glucose .
As based on our previous findings of strikingly high level of PCBs in fish from high pollution area ( e.g. mean level of 375430 ng/g lipid ) and considerably lower , but still relatively high level in background pollution area ( e.g. mean PCB level of 5150 ng/g ) , the information on the frequency of fish meals and approximate annual consumption of fish from local waters was obtained by questionnaires .
The association of contaminated fish consumption with very high blood levels of PCBs , DDE and HCB and increased ThV as well as with increased frequency of positive TPOab , high values of FT4 and impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) was found .
These associations were also confirmed in 16 marital pairs from high pollution area with very high PCB level in both members associated with high fish consumption .
It was concluded that , due to persistent heavy pollution of waters , soil and food chain namely by PCBs , but also by pesticides ( e.g .
DDE and HCB ) resulting from their previous extensive use in agriculture , the fish from local waters still remains the most important source of these toxic pollutants which results in considerable adverse health effects .
