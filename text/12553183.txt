The health hazards of occupational exposure to Mercury ( Hg ) in adult gold miners are well known , but little attention has been given to the effects of Hg exposure in the children of gold miners .
Children who assist their parents in gold mining operations or live in mining enclaves may be exposed to elemental Hg vapors or methylmercury-contaminated food , both of which may induce neurodevelopmental disabilities .
Brainstem auditory-evoked responses ( BAER ) were measured as biomarkers of subtle mercury-induced neurological impairment in Andean children of gold miners living in the Ecuadorian gold mining settlement of Nambija , where Hg exposure is prevalent .
Thirty-one children ( 19 boys and 12 girls , aged 4-14 years , mean age : 10 years ) in the study group were found to have a mean blood mercury ( HgB ) level of 23.0 micrograms/L ( SD : 19 , range : 2.0-89.0 micrograms/L ; median : 20 micrograms/L ) , which was significantly higher than the mean HgB level of a reference group of 21 Ecuadorian children ( 4.5 micrograms/L , SD : 2.3 ; t = 4.39 , P = 0.0001 ) , and in excess of the health-based biological limits for the U.S .
( 10 micrograms/L ) .
The BAER measures indicated statistically significant differences in interpeak III-V ( P = 0.03 ) and I-V ( P = 0.008 ) neural conduction times for children with HgB levels above the median .
BAERs at the conventional click stimulus rate of 10/second showed statistically significant positive correlations between HgB level and the absolute latency of wave V ( P = 0.03 ) , and the neural conduction times of the eighth nerve to midbrain I-V interval ( P = 0.02 ) .
BAER at 50/second revealed statistically significant relationships between HgB and the latency of wave VI ( P = 0.03 ) , and the I-VI interpeak interval ( P = 0.02 ) .
Brainstem neural conduction times suggested that some of the Hg-intoxicated children in the study group have subtle neurophysiological anomalies that may be more manifest at higher BAER stimulus rates , and that the Hg-exposed children of gold miners are at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities .
