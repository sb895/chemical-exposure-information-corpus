The breast milk concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ; sum of eight congeners : BDE-28 , 47 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 154 , 183 and 209 ) were determined ( by high resolution gas chromatographic high resolution mass spectrometry ) in samples from primiparous women collected in 2006 in Tianjin , China .
Dietary and lifestyle habits of the participants were obtained by questionnaires .
The median total PBDE concentration ( including BDE-28 , 47 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 154 , 183 ) was 2500 pg g(-1) lipid weight , ranging from 1700 to 4500 pg g(-1) lipid weight .
These levels were in the same range as those from Europe and Japan but much lower than those from North America .
The congener profile in China was also different from other countries .
The contribution of BDE-28 was around 15% , much higher than any other country , implying that a different Penta-BDE formulation might be used in the Chinese market .
The lower ratio of the sum of BDE-47 , 99 , and 100 to the sum of BDE-153 and 154 suggested that Octa-products were in more demand in China .
A significant correlation was found between a woman's PBDE concentration and the time she used electronic appliances ( h/d ) .
This implies that electronics are a potential source of PBDEs to people .
Inhalation or ingestion of particulate matter ( such as dust ) may also be an important exposure pathway .
There was no significant correlation between the PBDE concentration and the consumption of meat , fish , and milk .
Further research is needed to determine the specific contribution of each exposure route and their health effects .
