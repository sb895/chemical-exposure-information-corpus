The impact polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) exposure on thyroid status in pregnant women and newborns was investigated in various epidemiological studies , but findings show inconsistencies , and differences in biological indicators of exposure between studies limits comparison of results .
The aim of this research was to use a procedure previously developed to standardize PCB biological concentration data between published studies to perform a systematic analysis of associations between PCB exposure and thyroid hormones ( THs ) ( total and free T3 and T4 ) or thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) in pregnant women and newborns .
Biological concentrations from nineteen studies were expressed in total PCB equivalent per kg of lipids in maternal plasma ( \u03bcgPCBMPEQkg(-1) lipids ) .
Systematic analysis of the " standardized biological concentration-thyroid parameters " relationship was conducted through the application of methodological criteria in both pregnant women and newborns .
Standardization of PCB levels and application of methodological criteria led to assign higher confidence to ten of the reviewed studies .
Among the retained studies in pregnant women , only one reported a significant association between PCBs and total T3 levels , but no association were observed when circulating TSH and free T4 levels were used to assess thyroid function .
Regarding the association between prenatal PCB exposure and thyroid status in newborns , a lack of significant association was consistently obtained in the retained studies assigned an overall high confidence .
The weight of evidence of a significant impact of PCB exposure on TSH and TH levels at the described biological levels in pregnant women and newborns ( mean<1000\u03bcgPCBMPEQkg(-1) lipids ) appears low according to this systematical analysis .
