Effects of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) on thyroid hormone and immune response systems were examined in 16 Yusho patients at about 30 years after the outbreak of the Yusho accident .
Their toxic equivalent ( TEQ ) levels in the blood were 27.8-1048.5 pg/g fat with the median level of 222.4 pg/g fat , which was about seven times higher than that of healthy Japanese people .
Even at such high blood TEQ concentrations , they seemed not to affect the serum levels of thyroid hormones , thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , immunoglobulins ( A , G and M ) , autoantibodies ( antinuclear antibody , rheumatoid and lupus erythematosus ( LE ) factors ) , and lymphocyte subsets in the blood .
However , positive rates of rheumatoid factor were considered to increase in higher blood TEQ groups .
This investigation was done using rather small number of Yusho patients , so further large-scale investigations are needed to get more conclusive findings concerning their effects on thyroid hormone and immune response systems .
