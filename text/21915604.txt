Phthalate esters ( PAEs ) were examined in indoor and outdoor dust samples from the subtropical city of Guangzhou , China .
The \u2211(16)PAEs concentrations ranged from 121 to 3,223 \u03bcg g(-1) dust , with the median concentration of 840 \u03bcg g(-1) dust .
Significantly higher concentrations of PAEs in dust samples were found in offices where electrical and electronic devices , carpet pads , and office furniture were widely used .
Of the 16 PAEs , diisobutyl phthalate ( DiBP ) , di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) , and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) dominated the PAEs in indoor and outdoor dust samples , and accounted for >96.8% and >93.1% of the \u2211(16)PAEs concentrations , respectively .
The median daily inhalation exposure of \u2211(16)PAEs were 3.53 and 0.247 \u03bcg kg(-1) body weight day(-1) , and at the 95(th) percentile were 7.62 and 0.530 \u03bcg kg(-1) body weight day(-1) , up on the measured concentrations and estimated dust ingestion rates , respectively , for toddles and adults .
The ubiquitous distribution of PAEs as noted in this study suggests the need for detailed assessment of PAEs concentrations using more sites and to further investigate the factors influencing PAEs exposure in China .
