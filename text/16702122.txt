The purpose of this case series is to assess long-term sequelae of arsenic exposure in a cohort acutely exposed to arsenic in drinking water from a well dug into a landfill containing arsenical pesticides .
Ten of the 13 individuals ( or next of kin ) in the initial study agreed to participate in the follow-up study .
Next of kin provided questionnaire data and released medical information on the three individuals who had died .
The remaining seven cohort members were assessed by an interview , questionnaire , detailed physical examination and sensory nerve testing .
Available medical records were obtained and reviewed .
Sensory testing was performed using an automated electrodiagnostic sensory Nerve Conduction Threshold ( sNCT ) evaluation .
Sensory complaints and electrodiagnostic findings consistent with polyneuropathy were found in a minority ( 3/7 ) of subjects 28 years after an acute toxic arsenic exposure .
Two of the seven patients examined ( 1 of 3 with neuropathic findings ) also had hyperkeratotic lesions consistent with arsenic toxicity and one of the patients had hyperpigmentation on their lower extremities possibly consistent with arsenic toxicity .
