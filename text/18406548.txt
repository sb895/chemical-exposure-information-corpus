The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/PCDFs ) , and 18 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were determined in samples of foodstuffs widely consumed by the population of Catalonia , Spain .
The dietary intake of PCDD/PCDFs and dioxin-like ( DL)-PCBs was subsequently estimated for the population of this Spanish region .
These results were compared with those of a previous survey performed during 2000 .
For PCDD/PCDFs , the highest WHO-TEQ values corresponded to oils and fats ( 0.223 ng/kg ) , followed by fish and seafood ( 0.131 ng/kg ) and dairy products ( 0.057 ng/kg ) , while the lowest levels were found in fruits ( 0.003 ng/kg ) , as well as in vegetables and milk ( 0.009 ng/kg ) .
For DL-PCBs the highest WHO-TEQ values corresponded to the groups of fish and seafood ( 0.761 ng/kg ) followed by oils and fats ( 0.169 ng/kg ) , and dairy products ( 0.039 ng/kg ) , while the lowest values were observed in fruits ( 0.004 ng/kg ) , and vegetables ( 0.005 ng/kg ) and tubers ( 0.006 ng/kg ) .
The current dietary intakes of PCDD/PCDFs , DL-PCBs , and PCDD/PCDFs plus DL-PCBs were estimated to be 25.7 , 52.4 , and 78.1 pg WHO-TEQ/day vs. 95.4 , 150.1 , and 245.5 pg WHO-TEQ/day found in our previous survey .
It means reductions of 73% , 65% , and 68% , for PCDD/PCDFs , DL-PCBs , and PCDD/PCDFs plus DL-PCBs , respectively .
The current estimated intake for an adult male , 1.12 pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day , is lower than most intakes recently reported in a number of countries over the world .
