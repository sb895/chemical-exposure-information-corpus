The lifetime cancer risk and the hazard index of trihalomethanes ( THMs ) through oral ingestion , dermal absorption , and inhalation exposure from tap water of 15 districts in Istanbul are estimated .
The most dominant THM compounds are chloroform , bromodichloromethane ( BDCM ) , and dibromochloromethane ( DBCM ) in Istanbul tap water .
The results indicate that within three different pathways , Istanbul residents had a higher cancer risk through oral ingestion than through the other two pathways .
The lifetime cancer risks of oral ingestion for total THMs was highest in Esenyurt district , while the lowest lifetime cancer risk for total THMs was in Basaksehir district .
The lifetime cancer risks of chloroform , BDCM , and DBCM from tap water of all 15 districts were higher than 10(-6) , the negligible risk level defined by the USEPA .
Among the 15 districts , people living in Esenyurt have the highest risk of cancer due to the THM exposure through the multi-pathways , mainly because of the exposure to BDCM and DBCM .
The total cancer risk analysis concluded that each year approximately 5 of the 8 million Istanbul residents could get cancer from the daily intake of tap water .
