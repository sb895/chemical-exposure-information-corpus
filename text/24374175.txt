Urine samples ( n=207 ) of 47 infants between 1- and 5-month of age were quantitated for 12 metabolites of 7 phthalates and compared with samples collected from the mothers of the infants at different time points .
Median and 95-percentile were lower for all metabolites in urine samples of infants compared to mothers .
For di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) the 95-percentile daily intake was 23.3\u03bcg/kg b.w. for mothers and 5.4\u03bcg/kg b.w. for infants and for di-isobutyl phthalate ( DiBP ) 10.1\u03bcg/kg b.w. and 8.5\u03bcg/kg b.w .
Some values exceeded the corresponding tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) for DiBP for infants and mothers and for DEHP and di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) only for mothers .
Both , infants and mothers are able to efficiently form phase II metabolites but infants with a slightly lower degree .
Therefore , a distinguished risk assessment with respect to the formed toxic metabolites of phthalates would be necessary in combination with a reduction of the most toxic phthalates .
