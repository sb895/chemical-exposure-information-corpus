The levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in breast milk from Beijing , China , were studied .
The 6 predominant PBDEs congeners ( BDE47 , BDE99 , BDE100 , BDE153 , BDE154 and BDE183 ) in 23 pooled breast milk samples from 205 mothers living in Beijing were measured .
Mean and median of SigmaPBDEs concentrations in all samples were 1.12 ng g(-1) lipid and 1.07 ng g(-1) lipid , respectively .
The Statistical difference in SigmaPBDEs concentrations was found between urban areas ( 1.22 ng g(-1) lipid , n=14 ) and rural areas ( 0.97 ng g(-1) lipid n=9 ) .
The sum of BDE47 and BDE153 accounted for more than 70% of SigmaPBDEs in most samples .
The significant correlation was found between the SigmaPBDEs in pooled samples and average of consumption of food of animal origin in the pools in urban area .
However , there was no correlation was found between the SigmaPBDEs in pooled samples and average of consumption of food of animal origin in the pools in rural area of Beijing .
The current study showed that the level of PBDEs in breast milk from Beijing was lower than that from South China and some developed countries such as USA and Sweden .
