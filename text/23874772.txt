BACKGROUNDS The etiology of congenital heart defect ( CHD ) is commonly believed to involve the interaction of multiple environmental and genetic factors .
This study aimed to explore the joint effects of the ABCB1 gene C3435T polymorphism and maternal periconceptional toxicants exposure on the CHD risk in a Han Chinese population .
METHODS An age and gender matched case-control study with standardized data collection involving 201 pairs was conducted .
Periconceptional toxicants exposure was obtained through a structured questionnaire .
A job exposure matrix ( JEM ) was used for toxicants exposure assessment .
Genotyping of the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism was performed by sequencing .
Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the joint effects of the ABCB1 gene C3435T polymorphism and toxicants exposure on the risk of CHD .
Placenta tissues and umbilical cords were collected to investigate the impact of C3435T polymorphism on the transcription and translation activities of ABCB1 gene .
RESULTS MATERNAL PERICONCEPTIONAL EXPOSURES TO PHTHALATES ( ADJUSTED OR : 1.6 ; 95%CI : 1.0-2.6 ) and alkylphenolic compounds ( adjusted OR:1.8 ; 95%CI:1.1-3.0 ) were associated with a higher incidence of CHDs in general .
More cases were carriers of the ABCB1 CC/CT genotypes ( OR : 2.0 , 95%CI : 1.1-3.5 , P-value : 0.021 ) .
Children carrying the CC/CT genotype and periconceptionally exposed to phthalates and alkylphenolic compounds suffered almost 3.5-fold increased risk of having CHD than non-exposed children with TT genotype ( adjusted OR : 3.5 , 95%CI : 1.5-7.9 , P-value : 0.003 ) , and the OR changed to 4.4 for septal defects ( adjusted OR : 4.4,95%CI:1.8-10.9,P-value:0.001 ) .
The ABCB1 mRNA expression of the TT genotype was significantly higher than that of the CC genotype ( P\u200a=\u200a0.03 ) .
Compared with TT genotype , lower P-glycoprotein expression was observed for the CC/CT genotypes .
CONCLUSION The C3435T polymorphism in the ABCB1 gene of fetus increases the risks of CHD in a Han Chinese population when the mothers are exposed to phthalates and alkylphenolic compounds during the periconceptional period , particularly for septal defects .
