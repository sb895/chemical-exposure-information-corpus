BACKGROUND Environmental prenatal exposure to potentially neurotoxic metals poses a particular challenge with regard to the study of early toxic effects .
Monoamine oxidase activity , shown to be influenced by metals in experimental studies , could be a useful biomarker in humans .
OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship between blood metal concentrations at delivery and placenta MAO activity .
METHODS The study was performed in 163 pregnancies .
Maternal and cord blood samples were obtained for manganese ( Mn ) , lead ( Pb ) , and cadmium ( Cd ) determination .
Mercury ( Hg ) was also analysed in maternal hair .
Placental samples were stored immediately after expulsion and total MAO activity was measured .
RESULTS MAO activity was significantly positively correlated with maternal and cord blood Mn concentrations in subjects with high MAO activity .
In subjects with low MAO activity , maternal hair Hg was negatively correlated with MAO .
CONCLUSION Our results suggest the use of placental MAO as a potential surrogate marker of Mn toxicity in the newborn and its correlation with psychomotor development should be further investigated .
