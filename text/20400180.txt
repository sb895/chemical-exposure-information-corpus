Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) , especially perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , are known to occur throughout the environment and in the human population ( Houde et al. , 2006 ) .
The occurrence of PFCs in human umbilical cord blood and human milk , coupled with the potential developmental toxicity of PFCs , suggests the need for determining the exposure sources and magnitudes of PFCs in infants .
In this study , 10 PFCs were measured in 24 pooled samples consisting of 1237 individual human milk samples .
The samples were collected from 12 provinces of China in 2007 .
PFOS and PFOA were the predominant PFCs found in all the samples tested .
The geometric mean ( GM ) and median of the concentrations were 46 pg/mL and 49 pg/mL for PFOS , 46 pg/mL and 34.5 pg/mL for PFOA respectively .
A large variation in geographical distribution was observed for PFCs in human milk .
High concentrations of PFOA ( 814 pg/ml for the rural samples and 616 pg/ml for the urban samples ) were found in human milk from Shanghai .
Estimated dietary intakes ( EDI ) were established and the median , GM and the highest EDI of the total PFCs were 17.2 ng/kg/d , 17.8 ng/kg/d and 129.1 ng/kg/d respectively .
The EDI for PFOA ( 88.4 ng/kg/d ) for Shanghai was close to the tolerable daily intake ( 100 ng/kg/d ) proposed by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment and the Drinking Water Commission .
The results suggest both mothers and infants have a high exposure to PFCs in the Shanghai region .
The potential health impact of postnatal exposure through breastfeeding to infants should therefore be comprehensively evaluated .
