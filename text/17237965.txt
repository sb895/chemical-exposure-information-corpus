Because of uncertainties associated with a possible rise in neuro-developmental deficits among vaccinated children , thimerosal-preserved vaccines have not been used since 2004 in the USA ( with the exception of thimerosal-containing influenza vaccines which are routinely recommended for administration to pregnant women and children ) , and the EU but are widely produced and used in other countries .
We investigated the impact of thimerosal on the total Hg in hair of 82 breast-fed infants during the first 6 months of life .
The infants received three doses of the hepatitis-B vaccine ( at birth , 1 and 6 months ) and three DTP ( diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis ) doses at 2 , 4 and 6 months , according to the immunization schedule recommended by the Ministry of Health of Brazil .
The thimerosal in vaccines provided an ethylmercury ( EtHg ) exposure of 25 microgHg at birth , 30 , 60 and 120 days , and 50 microgHg at 180 days .
The exposure to vaccine-EtHg represents 80% of that expected from total breast milk-Hg in the first month but only 40% of the expected exposure integrated in the 6 months of breastfeeding .
However , the Hg exposure corrected for body weight at the day of immunization was much higher from thimerosal- EtHg ( 5.7 to 11.3 microgHg/kg b.w. ) than from breastfeeding ( 0.266 microgHg/kg b.w. ) .
While mothers showed a relative decrease ( -57% ) in total hair-Hg during the 6 months lactation there was substantial increase in the infant's hair-Hg ( 446% ) .
We speculate that dose and parenteral mode of thimerosal-EtHg exposure modulated the relative increase in hair-Hg of breast-fed infants at 6 months of age .
