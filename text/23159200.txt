Geophagy , the practice of consuming clay or soil , is encountered among pregnant women in Africa , Eastern Asia and Latin America , but also in Western societies .
However , certain types of clay are known to contain high concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) .
The aim of this study was to determine the PCDD/F contents of orally consumed clays purchased from Dutch and African markets .
Congener patterns were compared with those of pooled human milk samples collected in eight African countries , to investigate a possible relationship with clay consumption .
From the Dutch market thirteen clay products were examined , seven of African and six of Suriname origin .
From seven African countries , twenty clay products were collected .
All 33 clay products were screened with a cell-based bioassay and those showing a high response were analyzed by GC/HRMS .
High PCDD/F concentrations were measured in three clay products from the Dutch market , ranging from 66 to 103 pg TEQ g(-1) , whereas clay products from African countries were from 24 to 75 pg TEQ g(-1) .
Patterns and relatively high concentrations of PCDD/Fs in human milk samples from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and CÃ´te d'Ivoire suggest a relationship with the consumption of contaminated clay .
Frequent use of PCDD/F contaminated clay products during pregnancy may result in increased exposure of the mother and subsequently the developing fetus and new-born child .
The use of these contaminated clays during pregnancy should be carefully considered or even discouraged .
