Total mercury concentrations in human hair and urine samples were determined to ascertain the extent of environmental and occupational mercury exposure in Dunkwa-On-Offin , a small scale gold mining area of the central-west region of Ghana .
In all ninety-four ( 94 ) hair and urine samples comprising of forty ( 40 ) small scale miners and fifty-four ( 54 ) farmers were collected and analyzed for their total mercury levels using the cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry .
The hair total mercury concentrations ranged from 0.63 to 7.19 ug/g with a mean of 2.35 ± 1.58 ug/g for the farmers and 0.57-6.07 ug/g with a mean of 2.14 ± 1.53 ug/g for the small scale gold miners .
There was no significant correlation between the total mercury concentration and the average weekly fish diet .
The total mercury concentrations in urine of the miners were higher than those of the farmers and ranged from 0.32 to 3.62 ug/L with a mean of 1.23 ± 0.86 ug/L .
The urine concentrations of farmers ranged from 0.075 to 2.31 ug/L with a mean of 0.69 ± 0.39 ug/L .
Although the results indicate elevated internal dose of mercury the current levels of exposures do not appear to pose a significant health threat to the people .
