BACKGROUND Phthalate and phenol exposure is prevalent among the general population and of potential concern for pregnant women and children because of their suspected susceptibility to endocrine effects .
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the extent of exposure to several phthalates and phenols in a sample of Spanish pregnant women - according to their individual characteristics ( age , social class , education , and body mass index ) - and children who participated in the INMA - Infancia y Medio Ambiente ( Environment and Childhood ) project .
METHODS One spot urine sample was taken during the third trimester of pregnancy from 120 pregnant women and from 30 4-year old children belonging to 5 Spanish birth cohorts , and analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites and 9 phenols .
RESULTS Three metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate , mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate , mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate , and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate ; two metabolites of dibutyl phthalates , mono-isobutyl phthalate and mono-n-butyl phthalate ; monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) , the main metabolite of diethyl phthalate ; and two phenols , methyl paraben ( M-PB ) and 2,5-dichlorophenol were detected in the urine samples of all women .
The highest urinary concentrations were for MEP and M-PB .
Urinary concentrations of all phthalate metabolites and of 2,4-dichlorophenol , 2,5-dichlorophenol , and bisphenol A were lower in the pregnant women than in the children .
Among women , a positive relationship with social class and education was shown for most of the phthalate metabolites and phenols .
Almost all phthalate metabolites varied by region even after adjusting for social class and education .
CONCLUSIONS Phthalate and phenol exposures are prevalent in a group of pregnant women and young children , two susceptible populations , and these exposures might be positively related to social class .
