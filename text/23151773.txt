BACKGROUND Evidence suggesting that persistent environmental pollutants may be reproductive toxicants underscores the need for prospective studies of couples for whom exposures are measured .
OBJECTIVES We examined the relationship between selected persistent pollutants and couple fecundity as measured by time to pregnancy .
METHODS A cohort of 501 couples who discontinued contraception to become pregnant was prospectively followed for 12 months of trying to conceive or until a human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test confirmed pregnancy .
Couples completed daily journals on lifestyle and provided biospecimens for the quantification of 9 organochlorine pesticides , 1 polybrominated biphenyl , 10 polybrominated diphenyl ethers , 36 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and 7 perfluorochemicals ( PFCs ) in serum .
Using Cox models for discrete time , we estimated fecundability odds ratios ( FORs ) and 95% CIs separately for each partner's concentrations adjusting for age , body mass index , serum cotinine , serum lipids ( except for PFCs ) , and study site ( Michigan or Texas ) ; sensitivity models were further adjusted for left truncation or time off of contraception ( \u2264 2 months ) before enrollment .
RESULTS The adjusted reduction in fecundability associated with standard deviation increases in log-transformed serum concentrations ranged between 18% and 21% for PCB congeners 118 , 167 , 209 , and perfluorooctane sulfonamide in females ; and between 17% and 29% for p,pÂ´-DDE and PCB congeners 138 , 156 , 157 , 167 , 170 , 172 , and 209 in males .
The strongest associations were observed for PCB 167 ( FOR 0.79 ; 95% CI : 0.64 , 0.97 ) in females and PCB 138 ( FOR = 0.71 ; 95% CI : 0.52 , 0.98 ) in males .
CONCLUSIONS In this couple-based prospective cohort study with preconception enrollment and quantification of exposures in both female and male partners , we observed that a subset of persistent environmental chemicals were associated with reduced fecundity .
