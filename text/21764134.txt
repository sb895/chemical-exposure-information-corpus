Concentrations of 14 polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDEs ) and 28 polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCBs ) congers were measured in 137 samples of fish and meat from Nanjing , a city in the Yangtze River Delta , China .
Total concentrations of PBDEs were less in fish ( mean of 180 pg/g ww ; range 8.0-1100 pg/g ww ) , but more in non fish foods ( mean of 180 pg/g ww ; range 15-950 pg/g ww ) than those reported from other countries .
The total dietary intake of PBDEs and PCBs by humans were 9.9 ng PBDE/d and 870 ng PCB/d , respectively .
The daily intake by a 60 kg adult of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents ( TEQ(WHO) ) from PCBs was estimated to be 49 pg ( PCB)TEQ(WHO)/d ( 0.82 pg ( PCB)TEQ(WHO)/kg bw ) , which is less than the tolerable daily intake suggested by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
The daily intake of meat and fish accounted for 57.2% and 42.8% of the total intake of ( PCB)TEQ(WHO ) .
