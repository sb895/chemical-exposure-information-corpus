Arsenic contamination of drinking water is a major public health issue in many countries , increasing risk for a wide array of diseases , including cancer .
There is inter-individual variation in arsenic metabolism efficiency and susceptibility to arsenic toxicity ; however , the basis of this variation is not well understood .
Here , we have performed the first genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) of arsenic-related metabolism and toxicity phenotypes to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which arsenic affects health .
Using data on urinary arsenic metabolite concentrations and approximately 300,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) for 1,313 arsenic-exposed Bangladeshi individuals , we identified genome-wide significant association signals ( P<5Ã—10(-8) ) for percentages of both monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) near the AS3MT gene ( arsenite methyltransferase ; 10q24.32 ) , with five genetic variants showing independent associations .
In a follow-up analysis of 1,085 individuals with arsenic-induced premalignant skin lesions ( the classical sign of arsenic toxicity ) and 1,794 controls , we show that one of these five variants ( rs9527 ) is also associated with skin lesion risk ( P\u200a=\u200a0.0005 ) .
Using a subset of individuals with prospectively measured arsenic ( n\u200a=\u200a769 ) , we show that rs9527 interacts with arsenic to influence incident skin lesion risk ( P\u200a=\u200a0.01 ) .
Expression quantitative trait locus ( eQTL ) analyses of genome-wide expression data from 950 individual's lymphocyte RNA suggest that several of our lead SNPs represent cis-eQTLs for AS3MT ( P\u200a=\u200a10(-12) ) and neighboring gene C10orf32 ( P\u200a=\u200a10(-44) ) , which are involved in C10orf32-AS3MT read-through transcription .
This is the largest and most comprehensive genomic investigation of arsenic metabolism and toxicity to date , the only GWAS of any arsenic-related trait , and the first study to implicate 10q24.32 variants in both arsenic metabolism and arsenical skin lesion risk .
The observed patterns of associations suggest that MMA% and DMA% have distinct genetic determinants and support the hypothesis that DMA is the less toxic of these two methylated arsenic species .
These results have potential translational implications for the prevention and treatment of arsenic-associated toxicities worldwide .
