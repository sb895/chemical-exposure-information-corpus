To study the associations between exposure to vapours and aerosols of bitumen and genotoxic effects , a cross-sectional and cross-shift study was conducted in 320 exposed workers and 118 non-exposed construction workers .
Ambient air measurements were carried out to assess external exposure to vapours and aerosols of bitumen .
Hydroxylated metabolites of naphthalene , phenanthrene and pyrene were measured in urine , whereas ( +)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide ( (+)-anti-BPDE ) , 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8oxodGuo ) and DNA strand breaks were determined in blood .
Significantly higher levels of 8-oxodGuo adducts and DNA strand breaks were found in both pre- and post-shift blood samples of exposed workers compared to those of the referents .
No differences between exposed workers and referents were observed for ( +)-anti-BPDE .
Moreover , no positive associations between DNA damage and magnitude of airborne exposure to vapours and aerosols of bitumen could be observed in our study .
Additionally , no relevant association between the urinary metabolites of PAH and the DNA damage in blood was observed .
Overall , our results indicate increased oxidative DNA damage in workers exposed to vapours and aerosols of bitumen compared to non-exposed referents at the group level .
However , increased DNA strand breaks in bitumen workers were still within the range of those found in non-exposed and healthy persons as reported earlier .
Due to the lack of an association between oxidative DNA damage and exposure levels at the workplaces under study , the observed increase in genotoxic effects in bitumen workers cannot be attributed to vapours and aerosols of bitumen .
