BACKGROUND Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDE ) , which are used as flame retardants , have been found to be higher in residents of California than of other parts of the United States .
OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the role of immigration to California on PBDE levels in Latino children .
METHODS We compared serum PBDE concentrations in a population of first-generation Mexican-American 7-year-old children ( n = 264 ) , who were born and raised in California [ Center for Health Analysis of Mothers and Children of Salinas ( CHAMACOS ) study ] , with 5-year-old Mexican children ( n = 283 ) , who were raised in the states in Mexico where most CHAMACOS mothers had originated ( Proyecto Mariposa ) .
RESULTS On average , PBDE serum concentrations in the California Mexican-American children were three times higher than their mothers ' levels during pregnancy and seven times higher than concentrations in the children living in Mexico .
The PBDE serum concentrations were higher in the Mexican-American children regardless of length of time their mother had resided in California or the duration of the child's breast-feeding .
These data suggest that PBDE serum concentrations in these children resulted primarily from postnatal exposure .
CONCLUSIONS Latino children living in California have much higher PBDE serum levels than their Mexican counterparts .
Given the growing evidence documenting potential health effects of PBDE exposure , the levels in young children noted in this study potentially present a major public health challenge , especially in California .
In addition , as PBDEs are being phased out and replaced by other flame retardants , the health consequences of these chemical replacements should be investigated and weighed against their purported fire safety benefits .
