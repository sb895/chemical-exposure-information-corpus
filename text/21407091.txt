OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the balance and vestibular systems in healthy workers exposed to low concentrations of organic solvent mixtures .
METHODS The study groups comprised 60 workers exposed to mixture of organic solvents and 110 reference workers .
All subjects performed static posturography and electronystagmography ( ENG ) .
RESULTS In posturography , abnormal reaction time was more frequent and statistically longer in solvent-exposed group .
Also , worse results of movement coordination parameters were observed in this group .
The ENG square waves and abnormal optokinetic results were more common in exposed group .
Mean caloric response was shorter in the exposed group .
Negative relationship was found between time of caloric response and cumulative toluene concentration .
CONCLUSIONS Balance abnormalities in solvent-exposed workers indicated subclinical damage , mainly of central part of vestibular system and body-movement coordination .
It would not be reasonable to exclude the vestibular hyporeactivity .
