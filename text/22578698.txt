This study investigated the level of bisphenol A ( BPA ) in surface water used as potable water , drinking water ( tap and bottled mineral water ) and human plasma in the Langat River basin , Malaysia .
BPA was present in 93% of the surface water samples at levels ranging from below limit of quantification ( LOQ ; 1.3 ng/L ) to 215 ng/L while six fold higher levels were detected in samples collected near industrial and municipal sewage treatment plant outlets .
Low levels of BPA were detected in most of the drinking water samples .
BPA in tap water ranged from 3.5 to 59.8 ng/L with the highest levels detected in samples collected from taps connected to PVC pipes and water filter devices .
Bottled mineral water had lower levels of BPA ( 3.3±2.6 ng/L ) although samples stored in poor storage condition had significantly higher levels ( 11.3±5.3 ng/L ) .
Meanwhile , only 17% of the plasma samples had detectable levels of BPA ranging from 0.81 to 3.65 ng/mL .
The study shows that BPA is a ubiquitous contaminant in surface , tap and bottled mineral water .
However , exposure to BPA from drinking water is very low and is less than 0.01% of the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) .
