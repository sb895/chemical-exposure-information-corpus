The Agusan River basin of eastern Mindanao , the Philippines , hosts several centres of artisanal gold mining , the most important of which , Diwalwal , is a significant gold producer in global terms .
An investigation of the environmental impacts of artisanal mining in the Agusan system , with particular reference to mercury contamination , was initiated in 1995 following reports of several incidents of human Hg poisoning in the province of Davao del Norte .
Results show drainage downstream of Diwalwal is characterised by extremely high levels of Hg both in solution ( maximum 2906 micrograms/l ) and in bottom sediments ( > 20 mg/kg ) .
Filtered surface water Hg levels exceed the WHO Drinking Water guideline and the US-EPA Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Life for a downstream distance of more than 14 km , including channel sections utilised for fishing and potable water supply .
The Environment Canada sediment quality Hg Toxic Effect Threshold for the Protection of Aquatic Life is exceeded for a downstream distance of 20 km .
Hair Hg data indicate that ballmill and CIP plant operators processing Hg contaminated tailings at eastern Mindanao's principal gold beneficiation centre , Apokon , may be subject to enhanced occupational Hg exposure .
It appears that the wider population of this area has not been affected .
