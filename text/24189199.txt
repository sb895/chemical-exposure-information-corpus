BACKGROUND Perfluoroalkyl substances ( PFASs ) are widespread and persistent environmental pollutants .
Previous studies , primarily among non-pregnant individuals , suggest positive associations between PFAS levels and certain blood lipids .
If there is a causal link between PFAS concentrations and elevated lipids during pregnancy , this may suggest a mechanism by which PFAS exposure leads to certain adverse pregnancy outcomes , including preeclampsia .
METHODS This cross-sectional analysis included 891 pregnant women enrolled in the Norwegian Mother and Child ( MoBa ) Cohort Study in 2003-2004 .
Non-fasting plasma samples were obtained at mid-pregnancy and analyzed for nineteen PFASs .
Total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and triglycerides were measured in plasma .
Linear regression was used to quantify associations between each PFAS exposure and each lipid outcome .
A multiple PFAS model was also fitted .
RESULTS Seven PFASs were quantifiable in >50% of samples .
Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) concentration was associated with total cholesterol , which increased 4.2mg/dL per inter-quartile shift ( 95% CI=0.8 , 7.7 ) in adjusted models .
Five of the seven PFASs studied were positively associated with HDL cholesterol , and all seven had elevated HDL associated with the highest quartile of exposure .
Perfluoroundecanoic acid showed the strongest association with HDL : HDL increased 3.7 mg/dL per inter-quartile shift ( 95% CI=2.5 , 4.9 ) .
CONCLUSION Plasma concentrations of PFASs were positively associated with HDL cholesterol , and PFOS was positively associated with total cholesterol in this sample of pregnant Norwegian women .
While elevated HDL is not an adverse outcome per se , elevated total cholesterol associated with PFASs during pregnancy could be of concern if causal .
