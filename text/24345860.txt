Coking influences environmental quality and poses high risks to human health as large amounts of heavy metals and metalloids are emitted into the environment from coal during the coking process .
Health risks depend heavily on multi-pathway and element-specific exposures , which have , unfortunately , been rarely studied .
In this study , children's health risks and exposure levels to As , Se , and heavy metals ( Pb , Cd , Cr , Ni , Co , Zn , Cu , Mn , V and Sb ) in the water , soil , dust , air and locally produced food were studied based on field sampling and questionnaire-based surveys around the largest coking area in China .
Human blood samples were collected and analyzed to indicate the exposure levels .
The non-carcinogenic risks to children mainly resulted from Cr , Mn , Pb , As and Sb , the levels of which were 3 to 10 times higher than the acceptable levels ( 1.0×10(-6) ) .
The carcinogenic risks to children were 30 to 200 times higher than the safe level ( 1.0×10(-6)-1.0×10(-4) ) , which could be attributed to Cr , As and Ni pollution .
The estimated risks mainly came from the pathway involving the ingestion of locally produced food , accounting for more than 85% in total for most elements .
For As , the food ingestion and air inhalation exposure pathways both contributed approximately 50% , respectively .
The high risks in this study highlight the attention paid to the health of children who live in the vicinity of coking activities and the importance of site-specific multi-pathway health risk assessments and food safety to protect potentially exposed children .
