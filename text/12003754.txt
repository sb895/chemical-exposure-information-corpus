Residential pesticide use is widespread in the United States .
However , data are limited specific to use among minority populations .
Nor are data available on the extent of pesticide exposure resulting from residential use during pregnancy .
We have gathered questionnaire data on pesticide use in the home during pregnancy from 316 African-American and Dominican women residing in northern Manhattan and the South Bronx .
Additionally , 72 women underwent personal air monitoring for 48 hr during their third trimester of pregnancy to determine exposure levels to 21 pesticides ( 19 insecticides and 2 fungicides ) .
Of the women questioned , 266 of 314 ( 85% ) reported that pest control measures were used in the home during pregnancy ; 111 of 314 ( 35% ) reported that their homes were sprayed by an exterminator , and of those , 45% said the spraying was done more than once per month .
Most ( >or= 90% ) of the pesticide was used for cockroach control .
Use of pest control measures increased significantly with the level of housing disrepair reported .
Of the women monitored , all ( 100% ) had detectable levels of three insecticides : the organophosphates diazinon ( range , 2.0-6,010 ng/m3 ) and chlorpyrifos ( range , 0.7-193 ng/m3 ) and the carbamate propoxur ( range , 3.8-1,380 ng/m3 ) , as well as the fungicide o-phenylphenol ( range , 5.7-743 ng/m3 ) .
We also frequently detected the following four insecticides ( 47-83% of samples ) but at lower concentrations : the pyrethroid trans-permethrin , piperonyl butoxide ( an indicator of exposure to pyrethrins ) , and the organochlorines 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane and chlordane .
Thirty percent of the women had detectable levels of all eight pesticides .
Exposures were generally higher among African Americans than among Dominicans .
We detected other pesticides in <or= 10% of samples .
Results show widespread prenatal pesticide use among minority women in this cohort .
Diazinon exposures for some women may have exceeded health-based levels , and our findings support recent federal action to phase out residential use of this insecticide .
