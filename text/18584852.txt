This study spatially analyzed potential carcinogenic risks associated with ingesting arsenic ( As ) contents in aquacultural smeltfish ( Plecoglossus altirelis ) from the Lanyang Plain of northeastern Taiwan .
Sequential indicator simulation ( SIS ) was adopted to reproduce As exposure distributions in groundwater based on their three-dimensional variability .
A target cancer risk ( TR ) associated with ingesting As in aquacultural smeltfish was employed to evaluate the potential risk to human health .
The probabilistic risk assessment determined by Monte Carlo simulation and SIS is used to propagate properly the uncertainty of parameters .
Safe and hazardous aquacultural regions were mapped to elucidate the safety of groundwater use .
The TRs determined from the risks at the 95th percentiles exceed one millionth , indicating that ingesting smeltfish that are farmed in the highly As-affected regions represents a potential cancer threat to human health .
The 95th percentile of TRs is considered in formulating a strategy for the aquacultural use of groundwater in the preliminary stage .
