Toluene diisocyanate ( TDI ) is a well-known cause of occupational asthma , but we know little about the potential for exposure and health effects among residents who live near facilities that release TDI .
In the mid-1990's , the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry investigated exposures to TDI and health outcomes in one community , which left some unanswered questions .
This cross-sectional study evaluated the potential associations between living near a TDI source and the prevalence of three variables : asthma or asthma-like respiratory symptoms , antibodies specific to TDI , and verifiable levels of TDI in residential air .
Results among North Carolina residents living near such facilities ( five target communities ) were compared with the results from residents living further away ( five comparison communities ) .
Overall , the prevalence of reporting either asthma or asthma-like respiratory symptoms was higher ( odds ratio = 1.60 ; 95% confidence interval = 0.97-2.54 ) among residents in target communities than those in comparison communities .
However , this difference was not statistically significant .
Symptom prevalence varied greatly among the community populations .
The prevalence of respiratory symptoms was higher near facilities with historically higher TDI emissions .
Among the 351 participants who provided blood samples , only one had immunoglobulin G specific antibodies to TDI .
This participant lived in a target area and may have had non-occupational exposure .
TDI was detected at an extremely low level ( 1 ppt ) in one of the 45 air samples from target communities .
One ppt is one-tenth the EPA reference concentration .
Overall , air sample and antibody test results are not consistent with recent or ongoing exposure to TDI .
