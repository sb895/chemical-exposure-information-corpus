Arsenic species were determined in rice and bulgur samples that were collected from 50 participants who also supplied exposure related information through a questionnaire survey .
Speciation analysis was conducted using an HPLC-ICP-MS system .
Ingestion exposure to arsenic and associated health risks were assessed by combining the concentration and questionnaire data both for individual participants and the subject population .
Inorganic arsenic dominated both in rice and bulgur but concentrations were about an order of magnitude higher in rice ( 160Â±38ng/g ) than in bulgur .
Because participants also consumed more rice than bulgur , exposures were significantly higher for rice resulting in carcinogenic risks above acceptable level for 53% and 93% of the participants when the in-effect and the proposed potencies were used , respectively , compared to 0% and 5% for bulgur .
An inorganic arsenic standard for rice would be useful to lower the risks while public awareness about the relation between excessive rice consumption and health risks is built , and bulgur consumption is promoted .
