In May 2006 , a serious environmental contamination with perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) became evident in a rural area of North Rhine-Westphalia ( NRW ) ( Region Sauerland ) , Germany .
In autumn 2006 , we performed a human biomonitoring study in which a 4-8-fold increase in perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA)-plasma concentrations of children , their mothers and men living in Arnsberg ( District Hochsauerlandkreis , NRW ) was observed compared with a reference population .
The exposure was clearly related to the consumption of PFOA-contaminated tap water .
However , there is no clear information on the duration of this contamination .
The current investigation involves the analysis of PFCs in 30 blood samples of young adults ( age 20-31 years ) who had ever lived in the affected area .
The samples were taken between 1977 and 2004 and stored at the German Environmental Specimen Bank for Human Tissues .
Analyses of PFOA , perfluoroctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) , perfluorohexanoate ( PFHxA ) , perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) , perfluoropentanoate ( PFPA ) and perfluorobutanesulfonate ( PFBS ) in blood plasma were performed by solid-phase extraction , HPLC and MS/MS detection .
PFOA values ( median , range ) were 6.1 , 1.7-40.7 microg/l , PFOS values were 18.8 , 8.1-150.7 microg/l and PFHxS values were 1.7 , 0.5-4.6 microg/l .
The concentrations of PFHxA , PFPA and PFBS in plasma were all below limit of detection .
Time-trend analysis showed that between 1977 and 2004 PFOA and PFOS levels remained fairly stable .
PFOS and PFOA levels were in the range of current background levels of the general population .
In contrast , PFHxS plasma levels have steadily increased since 1977 .
There was a close association between PFOS and PFOA-plasma levels .
From this pilot study there are no indications for an increased exposure to PFCs of residents in Arnsberg in the years 1977-2004 prior to the contamination in 2006 .
