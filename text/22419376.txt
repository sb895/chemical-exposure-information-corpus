Our aim for carrying out this study was to estimate the levels of mercury in the hair of pregnant women and its association with fish consumption and amalgam fillings .
From November 2007 to January 2008 , 100 hair samples were collected randomly from three groups of pregnant women : Ahvaz in the south of Iran , Noushahr in the north , and the countryside of Noushahr .
Significant differences were found in these three groups of pregnant women's samples ( p>0.05 ) .
The mean mercury level in women's hair was found to be 0.37 \u03bcg/g ( range , 0.11-3.57 \u03bcg/g ) .
Only in 2 % of collected hair samples did the total mercury ( THg ) level exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency-recommended 1.0 \u03bcg/g .
In addition , there was a positive correlation of THg content in Ahvaz group's samples with respect to fish consumption ( r=0.41 , p=0.02 ) and a negative correlation of THg content in those who consumed vegetables and fruit .
The level of education also played an indicating factor in this group .
Moreover , significant association was found between the residence time and Hg concentration of women's hair samples collected from Noushahr ( p>0.05 ) .
Similarly , the same correlations were found between hair mercury levels and the time since the first filling , number of dental fillings , pregnancy interval , and lactating period .
