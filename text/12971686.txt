Studies have shown blood lead levels of some children in South Africa at levels of health concern .
New studies show even relatively low lead levels to have detrimental effects on cognitive function in young children .
Large numbers of South African inner-city and other children have been shown to have unacceptably high blood lead levels .
Studies indicate that blood lead levels of children living in South Africa's urban areas are higher than those of children in most developed countries , including Great Britain , Europe , and the United States .
Although data and reported studies are very sparse , mean blood lead levels of approximately 15 microg/dl have been reported in children .
Elevated blood lead levels were associated with socioeconomic status and housing conditions .
Key environmental risk factors for elevated blood levels were contaminated soil and dust in the urban environment , and the still large number of automobiles using leaded gasoline .
In view of emerging evidence linking lead at increasingly lower levels to adverse effects in children , the South African government is taking actions to reduce lead exposure among vulnerable groups .
Currently , South Africa has no national lead surveillance program .
The government , therefore , has developed international and regional partnerships to prevent and address the problem of lead exposure .
