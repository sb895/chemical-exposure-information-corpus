BACKGROUND A growing body of evidence has associated maternal exposure to air pollution with adverse effects on fetal growth ; however , the existing literature is inconsistent .
OBJECTIVES We aimed to quantify the association between maternal exposure to particulate air pollution and term birth weight and low birth weight ( LBW ) across 14 centers from 9 countries , and to explore the influence of site characteristics and exposure assessment methods on between-center heterogeneity in this association .
METHODS Using a common analytical protocol , International Collaboration on Air Pollution and Pregnancy Outcomes ( ICAPPO ) centers generated effect estimates for term LBW and continuous birth weight associated with PM(10) and PM(2.5) ( particulate matter \u2264 10 and 2.5 Âµm ) .
We used meta-analysis to combine the estimates of effect across centers ( 3 million births ) and used meta-regression to evaluate the influence of center characteristics and exposure assessment methods on between-center heterogeneity in reported effect estimates .
RESULTS In random-effects meta-analyses , term LBW was positively associated with a 10-\u03bcg/m3 increase in PM10 [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.03 ; 95% CI : 1.01 , 1.05 ] and PM(2.5) ( OR = 1.10 ; 95% CI : 1.03 , 1.18 ) exposure during the entire pregnancy , adjusted for maternal socioeconomic status .
A 10-\u03bcg/m3 increase in PM(10) exposure was also negatively associated with term birth weight as a continuous outcome in the fully adjusted random-effects meta-analyses ( -8.9 g ; 95% CI : -13.2 , -4.6 g ) .
Meta-regressions revealed that centers with higher median PM(2.5) levels and PM(2.5):PM(10) ratios , and centers that used a temporal exposure assessment ( compared with spatiotemporal ) , tended to report stronger associations .
CONCLUSION Maternal exposure to particulate pollution was associated with LBW at term across study populations .
We detected three site characteristics and aspects of exposure assessment methodology that appeared to contribute to the variation in associations reported by centers .
