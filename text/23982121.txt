The US Environmental Protection Agency's ( US EPA ) Detroit Exposure and Aerosol Research Study ( DEARS ) has provided extensive data on human exposures to a wide variety of air pollutants and their impact on human health .
Previous analyses in the DEARS revealed select cardiovascular ( CV ) health outcomes such as increase in heart rate ( HR ) associated with hourly based continuous personal fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) exposures in this adult , non-smoking cohort .
Examination of time activity diary ( TAD ) , follow-up questionnaire ( FQ ) and the continuous PM2.5 personal monitoring data provided the means to more fully examine the impact of discreet human activity patterns on personal PM2.5 exposures and changes in CV outcomes .
A total of 329\u2009343 min-based PM2.5 personal measurements involving 50 participants indicated that \u223c75% of these total events resulted in exposures <35\u2009\u03bcg/m(3) .
Cooking and car-related events accounted for nearly 10% of the hourly activities that were identified with observed peaks in personal PM2.5 exposures .
In-residence cooking often resulted in some of the highest incidents of 1\u2009min exposures ( 33.5-17.6\u2009\u03bcg/m(3) ) , with average peaks for such events in excess of 209\u2009\u03bcg/m(3) .
PM2.5 exposure data from hourly based personal exposure activities ( for example, , cooking , cleaning and household products ) were compared with daily CV data from the DEARS subject population .
A total of 1300 hourly based lag risk estimates associated with changes in brachial artery diameter and flow-mediated dilatation ( BAD and FMD , respectively ) , among others , were defined for this cohort .
Findings indicate that environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) exposures resulted in significant HR changes between 3 and 7\u2009h following the event , and exposure to smells resulted in increases in BAD on the order of 0.2-0.7\u2009mm/\u03bcg/m(3) .
Results demonstrate that personal exposures may be associated with several biological responses , sometimes varying in degree and direction in relation to the extent of the exposure.Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication , 28 August 2013 ; doi:10.1038/jes.2013.46 .
