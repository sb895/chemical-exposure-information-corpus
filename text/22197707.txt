The widespread use of phthalates results in human exposure : phthalates are rapidly metabolized to their respective monoesters and other oxidative products , which are glucuronidated and excreted through the urine and feces .
Several in vivo studies showed that some phthalates , in particular diethyl-hexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) , diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) , di(n-butyl)phthalate ( DnBP ) and n-butylbenzylphthalate ( BBzP ) , are able to interact with the human endocrine system , interfering with the reproduction ability .
In this study , 56 couples were recruited from a centre of assisted reproduction .
Spot urine samples were collected and five urinary metabolites of the above phthalates were determined using an HPLC/MS/MS analytical method with isotopic dilution .
The results were compared with those of 56 couples of parents of one or more children and the statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the two groups in terms of urinary concentrations of phthalates metabolites .
A further step will be the correlation of these results with information on the life styles and working conditions collected through a specifically designed questionnaire .
