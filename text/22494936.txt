Perfluoroalkyl acids ( PFAAs ) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) are persistent organic pollutants representing two classes of environmental contaminants of toxicological concern , especially for infants .
Canadian biomonitoring data on these chemicals are limited .
The objectives of this study were to measure PFAAs and PBDEs in umbilical cord blood from approximately 100 hospital deliveries in Ottawa ( Ontario , Canada ) and examine associations with characteristics of the mother and infant .
Geometric means were 1.469 ng/mL for perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) ( 95% confidence interval of 1.292-1.671 ng/mL ) , 4.443 ng/mL for perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) ( 95% CI of 3.735-5.285 ng/mL ) , 0.359 ng/mL for perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) ( 95% CI of 0.318-0.404 ng/mL ) , and 0.579 ng/mL for perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) ( 95% CI of 0.473-0.709 ng/mL ) .
The final multiple regression models indicated that lower gravida , term gestational age , smoking during pregnancy and vaginal delivery were significantly associated with higher levels of PFOS .
Similarly , a vaginal delivery was significantly associated with higher PFOA , while weak associations were found with lower gravida and birth weight less than 2500 g .
Furthermore , higher PFNA concentrations were significantly associated with older mothers , and vaginal delivery , while weakly associated with term gestational age .
Elevated PFHxS concentrations were significantly associated with smoking during pregnancy and lower gravida .
Similar to reports from other countries , the preponderant PBDE congener measured in the cord blood was PBDE-47 .
Questions remain on why various studies have reported conflicting results on the association between PFAAs and birth weight .
