In order to investigate the neurobehavioral effects in workers occupationally exposed to organic solvents in Korea using WHO neurobehavioral core test battery ( NCTB ) , a cross-sectional study of 113 male car painters and printers and 81 controls was conducted .
Among the seven tests of the NCTB , only four tests--simple reaction time , Santa Ana dexterity , digit symbol , and Benton visual retention tests--were administered to the subjects because of time limitations .
Painters and printers were exposed mainly to toluene , xylenes , and methyl ethyl ketone and often to solvent mixtures .
The range of the solvent exposure level was 0.10-2.29 of hygienic effect .
Poorer performance of Benton visual retention in the exposed group when compared to the control group was found after controlling confounders .
No exposure-dependent effect was found .
Further investigation with a matched control group regarding confounding factors is required for conclusive results .
