The main aim of the study was to examine the possible effects of occupational exposure to styrene on color vision function and the course after reduction of exposure .
Color vision function was examined in 22 styrene-exposed laminators and 11 control subjects at a boat manufacturing plant .
The Lanthony D-15 desaturated panel was used to test acquired dyschromatopsia .
In all , six examinations were performed : Monday morning and Thursday afternoon of the same week , before and immediately after a vacation of 4 weeks ( altogether , phase 1 ) , and approximately 10 months later ( phase 2 ) , after the exposure level of styrene had been reduced .
Styrene uptake was objectified by biological monitoring measuring the metabolites mandelic acid and phenylglyoxcylic acid in urine samples taken on Thursday afternoon .
In both Thursday examinations , styrene-exposed workers had higher color confusion index ( CCI ) values compared with controls , which indicated quantitative color vision loss .
After an exposure-free period of 4 weeks , a significant decrease of CCI values to normal range was found in laminators .
Reexamination 10 months later showed also lower CCI values in exposed workers , indicating a dose-effect relationship .
Abnormal CCI values occurred primarily in subjects with an excretion of approximately 500 to 600 mg mandelic acid plus phenylglyoxcylic acid per gram creatinine or more .
We concluded that styrene-induced color vision dysfunction is reversible after an exposure-free interval of 4 weeks .
The current Biological Tolerance Value of 600 mg mandelic acid plus phenylglyoxcylic acid per gram creatinine , as used in Germany , protects styrene-exposed workers from this subclinical effect .
