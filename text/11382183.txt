N,N-Dimethylformamide ( DMF ) has excellent solvent properties and is used intensively in the production of synthetic leather and resins .
It has caused hepatoxicity in human and animal studies .
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and hepatitis C virus infections are reported to be the major causes of chronic liver diseases ( including liver cirrhosis and liver cancer ) in Taiwan .
This study examined the dose-response relationship of the observed abnormal liver function among the DMF-exposed workers and the interactions among DMF , other chemical exposures , HBV infection , and potential confounders on liver abnormalities .
The average DMF exposure concentration was 11.6 ppm ( median , 5.9 ppm ; range , 0.1 to 86.6 ppm ) ; 65 of 176 workers ( 36.9% ) had high ( > 10 ppm ) DMF exposure , 37 ( 21% ) had middle ( > 5 ppm , < or = 10 ppm ) exposure , and 74 ( 42% ) had low ( < or = 5 ppm ) exposure .
There were 24 of 65 abnormal liver function test results ( LFTs ) ( 36.9% ) ( elevations of either glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase , glutamate pyruvate transaminase , or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ) among the workers with high DMF exposure , 10 of 37 abnormal LFTs ( 27% ) among workers with middle DMF exposure , and 11 of 74 abnormal LFTs ( 22% ) among workers with low DMF exposure .
Compared with the workers having low DMF exposure , the HBV , drinking , body mass index ( BMI ) , sex , duration of employment , epichlorohydrin , and toluene exposure adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) ( and 95% confidence intervals [ CIs] ) for abnormal LFTs were 1.62 ( 0.61 , 4.28 ) for workers with middle DMF exposure and 2.93 ( 1.27 , 6.8 ) for those with high DMF exposure , and there was a significant dose response between DMF exposure and the prevalence of abnormal LFTs ( P = 0.006 ) .
There were significant associations between abnormal LFTs and HBV carriers ( adjusted OR : 3.11 ; 95% CI : 1.29 , 7.5 ; P = 0.01 ) and between abnormal LFTs and increased BMI ( adjusted OR : 2.2 ; 95% CI : 1.02 , 4.72 ; P = 0.041 ) .
Ultrasonography showed significant associations between chronic liver diseases and HBV carrier status , increased BMI , and high cumulative ( > 100 ppm-years ) DMF exposure ( respectively , adjusted OR : 9.58 , 95% CI : 1.79 , 51.4 , P = 0.007 ; adjusted OR : 13.2 , 95% CI : 1.32 , 132 , P = 0.025 ; and adjusted OR : 6.2 , 95% CI : 1.14 , 34.1 , P = 0.032 ) .
Drinking and BMI were significantly associated with fatty liver ( respectively , adjusted OR : 4.9 , 95% CI : 1.39 , 17.3 , P = 0.012 ; and adjusted OR : 7.93 , 95% CI : 1.6 , 39.3 , P = 0.01 ) .
In conclusion , this study demonstrated that ( 1 ) a significant dose-response relationship existed between liver function abnormalities and DMF exposure among workers in Taiwan , ( 2 ) HBV carrier status or increased BMI had synergistic effects with DMF in causing liver abnormalities ( abnormal LFTs and clinical chronic liver diseases ) .
