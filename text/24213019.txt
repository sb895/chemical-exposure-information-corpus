Background : Epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5 and hospital admissions .
The chemical composition of particles varies across locations and time periods .
Identifying the most harmful constituents and sources is an important health and regulatory concern.Objectives : We examined pollutant sources for associations with risk of hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory causes.Methods : We obtained PM2.5 filter samples for four counties in Connecticut and Massachusetts and analyzed them for PM2.5 elements .
Source apportionment was used to estimate daily PM2.5 contributions from sources ( traffic , road dust , oil combustion , and sea salt as well as a regional source representing coal combustion and other sources ) .
Associations between daily PM2.5 constituents and sources and risk of cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations for the Medicare population ( > 333,000 persons \u2265 65 years of age ) were estimated with time-series analyses ( August 2000-February 2004).Results : PM2.5 total mass and PM2.5 road dust contribution were associated with cardiovascular hospitalizations , as were the PM2.5 constituents calcium , black carbon , vanadium , and zinc .
For respiratory hospitalizations , associations were observed with PM2.5 road dust , and sea salt as well as aluminum , calcium , chlorine , black carbon , nickel , silicon , titanium , and vanadium .
Effect estimates were generally robust to adjustment by co-pollutants of other constituents .
An interquartile range increase in same-day PM2.5 road dust ( 1.71 \u03bcg/m3 ) was associated with a 2.11% ( 95% CI : 1.09 , 3.15% ) and 3.47% ( 95% CI : 2.03 , 4.94% ) increase in cardiovascular and respiratory admissions , respectively.Conclusions : Our results suggest some particle sources and constituents are more harmful than others and that in this Connecticut/Massachusetts region the most harmful particles include black carbon , calcium , and road dust PM2.5.Citation : Bell ML , Ebisu K , Leaderer BP , Gent JF , Lee HJ , Koutrakis P , Wang Y , Dominici F , Peng RD. 2014 .
