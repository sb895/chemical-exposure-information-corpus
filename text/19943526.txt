The authors determined concentrations of 24 elements in hair of workers contacting arsenic high concentrations in workplace air , of individuals suffering from malignancies variable in localization , and of general population residing in places with environmentally high level of arsenic .
Individuals with high hair content of arsenic and certain elemental dysbalance ( sharp decrease of elements ratio Si/Hg , Zn/Hg , Se/Hg , P/Hg , Ni/Hg and Nb/Hg , if compared to control group ) were assigned to high risk group for malignancies development .
