The purpose of this study was to determine if significant arsenic exposure was occurring at a Superfund site with elevated surface soil arsenic concentrations .
A second objective was to determine the statistical relationship between the various methods of measuring arsenic exposure in humans .
Random urine , 24-hr urine , hair , and fingernail samples were collected at the end of the workweek from 40 employees at an active pesticide manufacturing facility which had formerly produced arsenical pesticides .
There was no indication of adverse health effects among the employees attributable to arsenic exposure .
Mean urinary , hair , and fingernail concentrations of arsenic were well within normal values and indicated that significant arsenic exposure was not occurring among the employees .
Random and 24-hr urine measurements were significantly correlated .
Hair and fingernail results also were significantly correlated .
Urine results did not correlate well with hair or fingernail results .
Results of this study suggest that although there may be some individual variation , random and 24-hr urine arsenic results are not substantially different .
For the purpose of screening for arsenic exposure , random urine samples may be an adequate and preferable test for those populations in equilibrium with their environment .
