The concentrations of 12 congeners of non-ortho and mono-ortho dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( \u03a3DL-PCB ) were measured in 30 fish samples from Parma markets by GC/MS technique .
The samples were randomly purchased , choosing the species commonly found in supermarkets .
The concentration of DL-PCBs estimated remained under the fixed Italian limit of 4 pg g(-1)ww WHO-TEQ ( World Health Organization-Toxic Equivalent ) in the major part of the samples , so the situation seems to be not at a level sufficient to pose a risk to human health of the Parma population .
The medium daily intake for DL-PCBs for Italian consumers ( Parma ) was also estimated .
This value generally resulted minor than 2 pg g(-1) ww WHO-TEQ kg(-1) body weight , exceeding only in four cases : eel , smooth hound , starry smooth hound and tuna .
