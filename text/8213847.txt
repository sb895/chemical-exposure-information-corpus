Wood trimmers and planing operators from two separate sawmill populations ( N = 303 and 170 ) were studied by serology assessment and a self-administered questionnaire .
IgG antibodies to Rhizopus microsporus ssp. rhizopodiformis , Paecilomyces variotii , and Aspergillus fumigatus were measured by ELISA .
The questionnaire included questions about general respiratory symptoms and symptoms after handling moldy timber .
Personal exposure of wood trimmers to mold spores and wood dust was measured in one part of the sawmills .
R. microsporus was the most prevalent mold assessed by serology .
Antibody levels were higher and symptoms suggestive of mucous membrane irritation , chronic nonspecific lung disease , allergic alveolitis , and organic dust toxic syndrome were more frequently reported by wood trimmers than by planing operators .
The mean level of IgG antibodies to R. microsporus in sawmill workers working in the same work area was the best predictor of symptoms in both populations .
The consistent results indicate that exposure to spores of R. microsporus may cause several respiratory symptoms in wood trimmers .
