A total of 98 paired soil and outdoor dust samples were collected across mainland China for survey of perchlorate .
Perchlorate was detected in all of the soil and outdoor dust samples .
High levels of perchlorate were found in soil , ranging from 0.001 to 216 mg/kg in Northern China and from 0.001 to 25.8 mg/kg in Southern China .
Even higher perchlorate concentrations were detected in dust samples , with concentrations ranging from 0.132 to 5,300 mg/kg in Northern China , and from 0.270 to 3,700 mg/kg in Southern China .
This is the first known report of perchlorate in dust samples .
The high perchlorate levels in soil and dust may raise concern on the potential risk for organisms and human .
The daily perchlorate intakes were evaluated based on our measured perchlorate concentrations via inhalation , ingestion , and dermal contact of soil and dust for both children and adults , respectively .
In general , the exposure from soil does not appear to lead to perchlorate intakes exceeding the US EPA reference for both children and adults .
However , children can be at risk from exposure to perchlorate via dust , and it needs considerable concern for both children and adults at the sites with high dust perchlorate concentrations .
After comparison with other possible exposure pathways , such as from drinking water , we suggested that dust may be an important potential source of perchlorate exposure in China , and further study is needed , especially for indoor dust .
