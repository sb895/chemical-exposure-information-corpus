BACKGROUND Steel production is a major industry worldwide yet there is relatively little information on the pulmonary effects of air quality near steel manufacturing plants .
OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to examine how lung function changes acutely when healthy subjects are situated near a steel plant which is adjacent to a residential area .
METHODS Sixty-one subjects were randomly assigned to spend 5 consecutive , 8-hour days in a residential neighborhood approximately 0.9km from a steel plant , or approximately 4.5km away at a college campus .
Subjects crossed-over between sites after a nine-day washout period .
Lung function was measured daily at both sites along with air pollutants including SO2 , NO2 , O3 , PM2.5 , and ultrafine particles .
Diffusion capacity and pulse oximetry were also examined .
RESULTS Compared with the college site , the forced expiratory volume in 1-second/forced vital capacity , forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC , total lung capacity , functional residual capacity , and residual volume were lower near the steel plant by 0.67% ( 95% CI : 0.28 , 1.06),1.62% ( 95% CI : 0.50 , 2.75 ) , 1.54% ( 95% CI : 0.68 , 2.39 ) , 3.54% ( 95% CI : 1.95 , 5.13 ) and 11.3% ( 95% CI : 4.92 , 17.75 ) , respectively .
Diffusion capacity , forced expiratory volume in 1s , and pulse oximetry were also lower near the plant but these effects were not statistically significant .
Sulfur dioxide , ultrafine particulates , and oxides of nitrogen were greater near the steel plant site compared to the college site .
CONCLUSIONS Spending short periods of time near a steel plant is associated with a decrease in lung function .
