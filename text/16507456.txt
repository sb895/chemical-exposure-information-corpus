Although oxidative stress has been proposed as a mechanism of lead and cadmium toxicity mostly based on in vitro experiments or animal studies , it is uncertain whether this mechanism is relevant in the pathogenesis of lead- or cadmium-related diseases in the general population with low environmental exposure to lead and cadmium .
We examined associations of blood lead and urinary cadmium levels with oxidative stress markers of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase ( GGT ) , vitamin C , carotenoids , and vitamin E among 10,098 adult participants in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey .
After adjusting for race , sex , and age ( plus serum total cholesterol in the case of serum carotenoids and vitamin E ) , blood lead and urinary cadmium levels both showed graded associations , positive with serum GGT and inverse with serum vitamin C , carotenoids , and vitamin E ( p for trend < 0.01 , respectively ) .
These associations were consistently observed among most subgroups : non-Hispanic white , non-Hispanic black , men , women , all age groups , nondrinkers , drinkers , nonsmokers , ex-smokers , current smokers , and body mass index ( < 25 , 25-29.9 , and > or = 30 ) .
The strong association of blood lead and urinary cadmium levels with oxidative stress markers in this population suggests that oxidative stress should be considered in the pathogenesis of lead- and cadmium-related diseases even among people with low environmental exposure to lead and cadmium .
