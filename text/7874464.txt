The purpose of this investigation was to estimate the total hair mercury of diseased people ( not including patients of mercury poisoning such as Minamata disease ) .
Hair samples were collected from 133 diseased volunteers in Tokyo and the surrounding areas from Oct. 1992 to June 1993 .
The total mercury concentrations in the hair of ordinary diseased people ( atopic dermatitis , asthma , dementia , cerebral infarct , osteoporosis , hypertension and diabetes ) were from 2.08 ppm to 36.5 ppm .
Those values were considerably higher than that of healthy people of the same age groups .
However , the uptake routes and the metabolic mechanism of high hair mercury concentrations in diseased people are not clear .
