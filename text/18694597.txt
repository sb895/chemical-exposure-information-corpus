Concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( DLPCBs ) were measured in 26 seafoods commonly consumed by the Korean population .
The total toxic equivalent ( TEQ ) concentrations in seafood samples ranged from 0.01 to 6.76 pg TEQ/g wet wt , which were comparable with those found in other countries .
The predominant congeners found in seafood samples were 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8-PeCDF and 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-TCDF for PCDD/Fs and PCB 118 for DLPCBs .
Dietary intakes of PCDD/Fs and DLPCBs from seafood consumption were estimated for various age groups and gender in Korea .
The dietary intake of PCDD/Fs and DLPCBs from seafood consumption for the general population was estimated to be 1.23 pg TEQ/kg bw/day , values that are in the range of those reported for other countries .
Mackerel , tuna and hairtail contributed to the highest TEQ intakes , which collectively accounted for 66% of the total intake .
Among the eight age groups investigated , 3-6 year old children had the highest TEQ exposure , followed by 50-64 years , 30-39 years and <2 years .
Considering contributions of seafood consumption to the total dietary intake studies , the dietary TEQ intakes to the general population appear to be below the threshold values by international organizations .
The present study may be useful for risk management for dioxins and dioxin-like contaminants in Korean seafood .
