Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) were detected in 13 human adipose tissue samples from Spain , 3 women and 10 men .
Tetra- , penta- and hexabrominated diphenyl ethers were determined at ng/g lipid ( ppb ) level in all the samples .
The average TeBDE level was 1.36 ng/g , the average PeBDE was 0.93 ng/g and the HxBDE 1.83 ng/g .
Human adipose tissue levels of PBDE obtained in the current samples from Spain are comparable with the tissue levels reported in recent Swedish investigations .
