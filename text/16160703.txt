Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study ( HEALS ) , a multidisciplinary and large prospective cohort study in Araihazar , Bangladesh , was established to evaluate the effects of full-dose range arsenic ( As ) exposure on various health outcomes , including premalignant and malignant skin tumors , total mortality , pregnancy outcomes , and children's cognitive development .
In this paper , we provide descriptions of the study methods including study design , study population , data collection , response rates , and exposure and outcome assessments .
We also present characteristics of the study participants including the distribution of exposure and the prevalence of skin lesion at baseline recruitment .
A total of 11,746 married men and women between 18 and 75 years of age participated in the study at baseline ( a response rate of 98% ) and completed a full questionnaire interview that included a food frequency questionnaire , with a response rate of 98% .
Among the 98% of the participants who completed the clinical evaluation , over 90% provided blood samples and spot urine samples .
Higher educational status , male gender , and presence of premalignant skin lesions were associated with an increased likelihood of providing blood and urine samples .
Older participants were less likely to donate a blood sample .
About one-third of the participants consumed water from a well with As concentration in each of three groups : >100 microg/l , 25-100 microg/l , and <25 microg/l .
Average urinary As concentrations were 140 and 136 microg/l for males and females , respectively .
HEALS has several unique features , including a prospective study design , comprehensive assessments of both past and future changes in As exposure at the individual level , a large repository of biological samples , and a full dose range of As exposures in the study population .
HEALS is a valuable resource for examining novel research questions on the health effects of As exposure .
