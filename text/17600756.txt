Cytogenetic biomarkers are essential for assessing environmental exposure that can predict adverse human health effects such as cellular damage .
Chromosomal aberrations are the most important cytogenetic end-points successfully used for the cancer risk assessment of populations occupationally or environmentally exposed to different toxic chemicals .
Previous reports suggest that , increased frequency of chromosomal aberration ( CA ) , in peripheral blood lymphocytes , is a predictor of cancer .
Arsenic is a paradoxical human carcinogen , clastogen and aneugen .
Despite of exposure at similar extent , only 15-20% of individuals show arsenic induced skin lesions including Bowen's disease ( BD ) .
Previously we have reported the significant increase in CA in the individuals with arsenic induced skin lesions when compared to individuals without any skin lesions , drinking arsenic contaminated water at similar extent .
Presently , a matched case-control study was performed to examine whether biomarkers such as chromosomal aberrations can predict the development of arsenic induced Bowen's ( in situ carcinoma ) diseases .
Chromosomal aberrations ( both chromosome and chromatid types ) and mitotic index were analyzed from the lymphocytes of 25 cases of Bowen's patient which was compared to matched control from the individuals with arsenic induced non-cancerous skin lesions such as raindrop pigmentation , keratosis of palm and sole , hypo and hyper pigmentation .
Chromosomal aberrations/cell , chromosome type aberrations and total percentage of aberrant cells were significantly higher in cases compared to control ( p<0.01 ) .
These results suggest that chromosomal aberrations can be used for cancer risk assessment of the population exposed to arsenic through drinking water .
