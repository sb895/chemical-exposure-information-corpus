To examine possible links between neurotoxicant exposure and neuropsychological disorders and child behavior , relative concentrations of lead , mercury , and manganese were examined in prenatal and postnatal enamel regions of deciduous teeth from children with Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASDs ) , high levels of disruptive behavior ( HDB ) , and typically developing ( TD ) children .
Using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry , we found no significant differences in levels of these neurotoxicants for children with ASDs compared with TD children , but there was marginal significance indicating that children with ASDs have lower manganese levels .
No significant differences emerged between children with HDB and TD children .
The current findings challenge the notion that perinatal heavy metal exposure is a major contributor to the development of ASDs and HDB .
