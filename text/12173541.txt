Increased concentrations of arsenic were found in soil and ground water from a military training area in Munster , Lower Saxony , Germany , where chemical weapons were dumped after World War II .
In order to assess the possible impact of this contamination for nursing new-borns and infants , samples from breast milk of 36 women were analysed with respect to arsenic content .
Study participants came from three different regions : the city of Hamburg , the rural area of Soltau , Lower Saxony , and from Munster , the potentially contaminated area .
Breast milk samples were collected immediately before and after nursing on days 2 , 5 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , and 90 post partum .
At least 10 ml were required for measurements of arsenic , and 187 samples were of that volume .
Samples were analysed with a Perkin-Elmer Type 403 hydride-generation atomic absorption spectrometer , equipped with an arsenic EDL-lamp .
Arsenic was not detectable , i.e. below 0.3 microgram/l , in 154 of 187 samples .
The highest concentration of 2.8 micrograms/l was measured in a sample from the rural area of Soltau .
Geometric means of arsenic concentrations were comparable in the three regions .
Concentrations did neither differ in samples obtained before and after nursing nor with respect to age of the infant .
The calculated daily intake of arsenic was in the range of 0.02 to 0.06 microgram per kg body weight , which is far below the lower limit of daily permissible intake for adults ( WHO/JECFA recommendation 1993 ) of 15 micrograms/kg/wk .
In conclusion , we found concentrations of arsenic in breast milk within the reported safety limits .
This was also true for samples from women living in a region which has previously been shown to be contaminated with arsenic from chemical weapons .
