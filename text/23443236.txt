Consumption of inorganic arsenic in drinking water at high levels has been associated with chronic diseases .
Research groups have estimated historic exposure using databases and models of arsenic in drinking water supplies , along with participant residential histories .
Urinary arsenic species are an established biomarker of recent exposure ; we compare arsenic concentrations in historically collected urine samples with predicted estimates of arsenic exposure .
Using a cohort of 462 subjects with at least one urine sample collected from 1984-1992 and an arsenic exposure estimate through drinking water at the time of the urine sample , individual exposure estimates were compared with speciated urine arsenic ( UAs ) concentrations using correlation and multiple regression analyses .
Urine inorganic arsenic ( UIAs ) concentrations ( trivalent arsenic , pentavalent arsenic , monomethylarsonic acid , dimethylarsonic acid ) were best predicted by residential water arsenic concentrations ( R(2)=0.3688 ) , compared with metrics including water consumption ( R(2)=0.2038 ) or water concentrations at employment locations ( R(2)=0.2331 ) .
UIAs concentrations showed similar correlation when stratified by whether the arsenic concentration was predicted or measured .
Residential water arsenic concentrations , independent of water intake or water concentrations at places of employment , best explain the variability in UIAs concentrations , suggesting historical reconstruction of arsenic exposure that accounts for space-time variability and water concentrations may serve as a proxy for exposure .
