Cadmium and other metallic ions can act as metalloestrogens and endocrine disruptors of reproductive tissues and fetal development in mammals , including humans .
The detrimental effects occur with respect to the synthesis of both steroid and polypeptide hormones in the placenta .
Leptin is produced by the trophoblast and may regulate fetal organogenesis and development .
In human term placentas , concentrations of toxic metals and their effects on steroidogenesis were assessed in healthy parturients ( 109 non-smokers and 99 smokers ) in relation to tobacco smoking .
Trace elements ( cadmium , lead , iron , zinc and copper ) were analyzed in placentas using atomic absorption spectroscopy , and steroid hormones ( progesterone and estradiol ) were assayed in placental samples by an enzyme-immunometric method .
Cadmium concentrations were doubled in placentas of smokers as compared with non-smokers , and placental lead and zinc concentrations increased significantly .
Placental concentrations of iron , copper , progesterone and estradiol did not differ .
In addition , human trophoblast cells were co-cultured with 0 , 5 , 10 or 20 microm CdCl(2) for 96 h and leptin mRNA assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction .
Leptin mRNA declined dose-responsively as a result of CdCl(2) exposure .
Collectively , the results confirm that human placental tissue offers a unique opportunity to biomonitor cadmium exposure in both the maternal and the internal fetal environments .
In addition , the results strongly suggest that cadmium may cause a decline in placental leptin synthesis , as we have previously shown for placental progesterone production .
This may constitute further evidence of the endocrine-disrupting effects of cadmium , as a constituent of tobacco smoke , on reproduction in women .
