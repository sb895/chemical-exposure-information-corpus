BACKGROUND After exposure to mercury vapor at three consecutive 10-month intervals , an electrician in an electroplating plant had flare-ups of ulcerative colitis within 24 hr , that subsided in several days , then returned upon re-exposure 10 months later .
METHODS The patient and his workplace were both evaluated for mercury exposure .
In addition to workplace inspection , both personal and area monitoring for environmental mercury was performed , using both multiple mercury diffusion badges and direct ( instantaneous ) readings , during maintenance of mercury-filled electrical blocks .
RESULTS Eight-hour time weighted average ( TWA ) mercury vapor exposure was measured at 0.41 mg/m3 ( ACGIH and NIOSH recommended TWA = 0.025 mg/m3 ; OSHA permissible exposure limit -0.1 mg/m3 ) for 5 years since stopping overexposure to mercury , the patient remained symptom free in clinical remission .
CONCLUSIONS In a patient with chronic ulcerative colitis in remission , occupational exposure to mercury vapor led to episodes of disease reactivation .
