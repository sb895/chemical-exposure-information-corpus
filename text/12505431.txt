The extent of exposure of residents of Changqing ( Guizhou , PR China ) to arsenic through coal-burning was investigated .
Despite the low coal-arsenic content ( 56.3+/-42.5 mg As kg(-1) ) when compared with coals collected at different location and times from the same province , more than 30% of the study subjects have shown symptoms of arsenicosis .
Coal , urine , hair , and water samples were collected in mid-September 2001 and analysed for arsenic .
The average urinary and hair-arsenic concentrations in the exposed subjects were 71.4+/-37.1 microg As g(-1) creatinine ( control 41.6+/-12.1 ) and 7.99+/-8.16 mg kg(-1) , respectively .
A positive correlation between the hair and urinary-arsenic concentration ( R(2)=0.601 ) was found .
There was no significant difference between females and males for both urinary and hair-arsenic concentrations .
Females were found to have a higher dimethylarsinic acid but lower percentages of inorganic arsenic and monomethylarsonic acid in their urine than males .
