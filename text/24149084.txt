BACKGROUND Few studies have investigated traffic-related air pollution as a risk factor for respiratory infections during early childhood .
OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and pneumonia , croup , and otitis media in 10 European birth cohorts--BAMSE ( Sweden ) , GASPII ( Italy ) , GINIplus and LISAplus ( Germany ) , MAAS ( United Kingdom ) , PIAMA ( the Netherlands ) , and four INMA cohorts ( Spain)--and to derive combined effect estimates using meta-analysis .
METHODS Parent report of physician-diagnosed pneumonia , otitis media , and croup during early childhood were assessed in relation to annual average pollutant levels [ nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , nitrogen oxide ( NOx ) , particulate matter\u22642.5 \u03bcm ( PM2.5 ) , PM2.5 absorbance , PM10 , PM2.5-10 ( coarse PM) ] , which were estimated using land use regression models and assigned to children based on their residential address at birth .
Identical protocols were used to develop regression models for each study area as part of the ESCAPE project .
Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted effect estimates for each study , and random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate combined estimates .
RESULTS For pneumonia , combined adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) were elevated and statistically significant for all pollutants except PM2.5 ( e.g. , OR=1.30 ; 95% CI : 1.02 , 1.65 per 10-\u03bcg/m3 increase in NO2 and OR=1.76 ; 95% CI : 1.00 , 3.09 per 10-\u03bcg/m3 PM10 ) .
For otitis media and croup , results were generally null across all analyses except for NO2 and otitis media ( OR=1.09 ; 95% CI : 1.02 , 1.16 per 10-\u03bcg/m3 ) .
CONCLUSION Our meta-analysis of 10 European birth cohorts within the ESCAPE project found consistent evidence for an association between air pollution and pneumonia in early childhood , and some evidence for an association with otitis media .
