This paper presents measured dioxin , dibenzofuran , PCB , DDE and HCB blood and milk levels and estimated body burdens in a mother who nursed twins for thirty-eight months .
A total of thirteen milk samples and three blood samples were collected and analyzed .
Measured PCDD and PCDF levels in milk decreased from 309 and 21 ng/kg ( ppt ) to 173 and 9 ng/kg , respectively , between March 1993 and September 1995 .
Based on the decrease in breast milk dioxin levels , we estimate that the nursing mother reduced her dioxin body burden from 310 to 96 ng dioxin toxic equivalents ( TEQs ) , or approximately 69% .
In two and one half years the level of HCB in the mother's milk decreased from 10.7 to less than 1.8 ng/g ( ppb ) , the level of DDE decreased from 246 to 46 ng/g and the total level of non-coplanar PCBs decreased from 285 to 63 ng/g , on a lipid basis .
We estimate that the twin's consumption of dioxins , dibenzofurans , and coplanar PCBs from breast feeding was approximately 115 ng TEQ per twin .
