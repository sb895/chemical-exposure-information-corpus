We examined the serum lipid adjusted levels of 2,3,7,8-substituted chlorinated dioxins and furans , and four coplanar PCBs for 98 workers .
We found workers who worked only in the trichlorophenol units had mean lipid adjusted 2,3,7,8-TCDD levels of 36.8 ppt significantly higher ( p<0.05 ) than 6.0 ppt in the reference group .
Workers who worked only in the pentachlorophenol units had mean lipid adjusted levels for 123478-HxCDD of 14.8 ppt , 123678-HxCDD of 156.4 ppt,123789-HxCDD of 23.7 ppt , 1234678-HpCDD of 234.6 ppt , and OCDD of 2,778.2 ppt significantly higher ( p<0.05 ) than the reference group levels for the same congeners of 7.5 , 71.8 , 8.0 , 67.5 , and 483.2 ppt , respectively .
While we did find 12378-PeCDD levels higher than the reference group in trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol workers , the differences are small , and could be attributed to normal variation .
All furan levels among the trichlorophenol or pentachlorophenol only workers were not significantly different than the reference group .
Workers with both trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol exposures had mean dioxin levels consistent with complex chlorophenol exposures .
Tradesmen who worked throughout the plant had congener profiles consistent with both trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol exposures .
PCB 169 , 23478-PeCDF , 123478-HxCDF , and 123678-HxCDF levels were also significantly greater ( p<0.05 ) in these tradesmen than in the reference group .
We found distinct patterns of dioxin congeners many years after exposure among workers with different chlorophenol exposures .
We were effectively able to distinguish past trichlorophenol exposures from pentachlorophenol exposures based on differing serum dioxin profiles among workers .
