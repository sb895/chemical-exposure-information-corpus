BACKGROUND In 1996 and 2009 , the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified silica as carcinogenic to humans .
The exposure-response relationship between silica and lung cancer risk , however , is still debated .
Data from the German uranium miner cohort study were used to further investigate this relationship .
METHODS The cohort includes 58677 workers with individual information on occupational exposure to crystalline silica in mg m(-3)-years and the potential confounders radon and arsenic based on a detailed job-exposure matrix .
In the follow-up period 1946-2003 , 2995 miners died from lung cancer .
Internal Poisson regression with stratification by age and calendar year was used to estimate the excess relative risk ( ERR ) per dust-year .
Several models including linear , linear quadratic and spline functions were applied .
Detailed adjustment for cumulative radon and arsenic exposure was performed .
RESULTS A piecewise linear spline function with a knot at 10 mg m(-3)-years provided the best model fit .
After full adjustment for radon and arsenic no increase in risk <10 mg m(-3)-years was observed .
Fixing the parameter estimate of the ERR in this range at 0 provided the best model fit with an ERR of 0.061 ( 95% confidence interval : 0.039 , 0.083 ) >10 mg m(-3)-years .
CONCLUSION The study confirms a positive exposure-response relationship between silica and lung cancer , particularly for high exposures .
