This study was designed to evaluate both levels and distributions of organochlorine pollutants in placenta and other maternal-foetal tissues , from women resident in an Italian highly industrialized urban area with demonstrated PCB pollution .
To this end , 30 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners ( PCBs ) , p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( p,p'-DDT ) , p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , were determined in placenta , both maternal and cord blood serum and adipose tissue of Caucasian pregnant women ( n=70 ) undergoing to programmed caesarean delivery .
Median placental concentrations of PCBs , p,p'-DDE and HCB ( 0.89 ng g(-1) , 0.63 ng g(-1) and 0.19 ng g(-1) on wet tissue weight basis , respectively ) , were lower than previously published data. p,p'-DDT could be detected in most of adipose tissue samples , but very rarely in the other compartments .
Distributions of investigated compounds in biological matrices showed significant relationships , confirming their transplacental transfer .
It is worthy of note that HCB tended to be transferred more easily from maternal to foetal tissues .
Maternal serum levels of these pollutants can allow a reliable estimation of organochlorine compound body burden , and can be useful markers of prenatal exposure , given their relationships with placental and umbilical cord serum levels .
