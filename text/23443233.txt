In order to evaluate the degree of arsenic ( As ) exposure and the factors influencing urinary As excretion and metabolism , 192 workers from a steel and iron smelting plant , with different type of work in production such as roller , steel smelting , iron smelting and metallic charge preparation , were recruited .
Information about characteristics of each subject was obtained by questionnaire and inorganic As ( iAs ) , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) in urine were determined .
The results showed that steel smelters had significantly higher concentrations of DMA and total As ( TAs ) than rollers and metallic charge preparation workers , and iron and steel smelters had a higher value of primary methylation index and lower proportion of the iAs ( iAs% ) than rollers and metallic charge preparation workers .
In steel smelters , urinary As level exceeded the biological exposure index ( BEI ) limit for urinary As of 35\u2009\u03bcg/l by 65.52% , and higher than metallic charge preparation workers ( 35.14% ) .
The individuals consumed seafood in recent 3 days had a higher TAs than the individuals without seafood consumption .
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that different jobs , taken Chinese medicine of bezoar and seafood consumption in recent 3 days were significantly associated with urinary TAs exceeded BEI limit value 35\u2009\u03bcg/l .
Our results suggest that workers in steel and iron smelting plant had a lower level of As exposure , and seafood consumption and taking Chinese medicine of bezoar also could increase the risk of urinary TAs exceeded BEI limit value .
