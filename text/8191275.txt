This paper investigates the hypothesis that mercury from silver dental fillings ( amalgam ) may be related to multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
It compares blood findings between MS subjects who had their amalgams removed to MS subjects with amalgams .
MS subjects with amalgams were found to have significantly lower levels of red blood cells , hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to MS subjects with amalgam removal .
Thyroxine levels were also significantly lower in the MS amalgam group and they had significantly lower levels of total T Lymphocytes and T-8 ( CD8 ) suppressor cells .
The MS amalgam group had significantly higher blood urea nitrogen and lower serum IgG .
Hair mercury was significantly higher in the MS subjects compared to the non-MS control group .
A health questionnaire found that MS subjects with amalgams had significantly more ( 33.7% ) exacerbations during the past 12 months compared to the MS volunteers with amalgam removal .
The paper also examines epidemiological correlations between dental caries and MS ; as well as how mercury could be causing the pathological and physiological changes found in multiple sclerosis .
