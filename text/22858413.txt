A direct water intake study was conducted for one year , involving 423 individuals from three arsenic ( As ) affected villages of West Bengal , India .
Average direct water intake per person and per unit body weight was found to be 3.12±1.17 L/day and 78.07±47.08 mL/kg/day ( ± SD ) , respectively .
Average direct water intakes for adult males , adult females and children ( age <15 years ) were 3.95 , 3.03 and 2.14 L/day , respectively .
Significant sex differentials were observed between ages 16-55 years .
For all participants , a sharp increase in water intake up to 15 years of age was observed followed by a plateau at a higher intake level .
Significant monthly , seasonal , regional , and occupational variability was also observed .
Another study involving 413 subjects determined the amount of indirect water intake .
Average indirect water intake per person was 1.80±0.64 L/day ; for adult males , adult females and children , intake was 2.15 , 1.81 , and 1.10 L/day , respectively .
Average total ( direct + indirect ) water intake was 4.92 L/person/day ; for adult males , adult females and children , total intake was 6.10 , 4.84 , and 3.24 L/person/day , respectively .
The overall contribution of indirect water intake to total water consumption was 36.6% for all participants .
This study additionally elucidated several factors that contribute to variable water intake , which can lead to better risk characterization of subpopulations and water contaminant ingestion .
The study reveals that the water intake rates in the three studied populations in West Bengal are greater than the assumed water intake rates utilized by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in the establishment of drinking water quality guidelines ; therefore , these assumed intake values may be inappropriate for the study population as well as similar ones .
