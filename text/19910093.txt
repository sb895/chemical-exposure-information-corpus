In an extensive environmental study , field samples , including soil , water , rice , vegetable , fish , human hair and urine , were collected at an abandoned tungsten mine in Shantou City , southern China .
Results showed that arsenic ( As ) concentration in agricultural soils ranged from 3.5 to 935 mg kg(-1) with the mean value of 129 mg kg(-1) .
In addition , As concentration reached up to 325 microg L(-1) in the groundwater , and the maximum As concentration in local food were 1.09 , 2.38 and 0.60 mg kg(-1) for brown rice , vegetable and fish samples , respectively , suggesting the local water resource and food have been severely contaminated with As .
Health impact monitoring data revealed that As concentrations in hair and urine samples were up to 2.92 mg kg(-1) and 164 microg L(-1) , respectively , indicating a potential health risk among the local residents .
Effective measurements should be implemented to protect the local community from the As contamination in the environment .
