Two mass-food poisonings called Yusho and Yucheng occurred in Japan and Taiwan in 1968 and 1979 , respectively .
Blood samples from five Yusho patients and three Yucheng patients were collected several times from 1982 to 1998 and from 1980 to 1995 , respectively , and analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDF ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) congeners .
Fat base concentrations of 2,3,4,7,8-penta-CDF in the Yusho patients , which were responsible for about 70% of the dioxin toxicity , are estimated to be decreased from 60 ppb in 1969 to 800 ppt in 1997 with the median half-life of 2.9 years in the first 15 years after onset and 7.7 years in the next stage of 15 years .
Typical Yusho symptoms of acneiform eruption , dermal pigmentation and increased eye discharge were very gradually recovered with lapse of several years .
However , enzyme and/or hormone-mediated signs of high serum triglyceride , high serum thyroxin , immunoglobulin disorder and others are persistently maintained for 30 years .
