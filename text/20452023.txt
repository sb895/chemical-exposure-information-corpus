This study investigated the levels of 4-nonylphenol ( 4-NP ) , bisphenol A ( BPA ) and triclosan ( TCS ) in bottled water and tap water in Guangzhou and release of these chemicals from baby bottles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with negative chemical ionization .
Results show that 4-NP was present in all the bottled water while 17 out of 21 contained BPA and 18 out of 21 contained TCS .
Their concentrations in bottled water ranged from 108 to 298 ng/L , 17.6 to 324 ng/L and 0.6 to 9.7 ng/L , respectively .
Five of the tap water samples from six drinking water plants were found to contain 4-NP and BPA both in June and December , while TCS was detected in the same five plants only in June .
The highest concentrations in tap water for 4-NP , BPA and TCS were 1987 , 317 and 14.5ng/L , respectively .
Daily intakes of 4-NP , BPA and TCS of adults by drinking 2L of tap water were estimated to be 1410 , 148 and 10 ng/day , respectively .
BPA was found to be released within 24h from four brands of baby bottles at room temperature ( 24 degrees C ) , 40 degrees C and 100 degrees C. Increased temperature led to higher release of BPA from the baby bottles .
Estimated daily intakes of 4-NP , BPA and TCS for infants were 705 , 1340 and 5 ng/day , respectively , by drinking 1L of tap water from a baby bottle at 40 degrees C. This study showed that the exposure to the three compounds from drinking water is unlikely to pose a health risk .
