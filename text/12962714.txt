The time-trend and recent concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in Japanese mother's milk were investigated .
The time-trend of 16 PBDEs ( BDE-28 , 37 , 47 , 66 , 71 , 75 , 77 , 85 , 99 , 100 , 119 , 153 , 154 , 138 , 183 , and 190 ) in pooled milk samples from mothers living in Osaka between 1973 and 2000 was analyzed .
Additionally , PBDE concentrations in individual milk samples collected from 13 mothers living in Kanagawa and Okayama in 1999 were measured .
The total concentration of all PBDE congeners ( SigmaPBDEs ) measured in the pooled samples increased during the period between 1973 ( <0.01 ng/g lipid ) and 1988 ( 1.64 ng/g lipid ) , and remained low afterwards while showing remarkable changes in PBDE congener profiles .
The SigmaPBDEs in the 1999 individual milk samples were also low ( 0.56-3.97 ng/g lipid ) , except for a single sample ( 291 ng/g lipid ) .
The source of this exposure could not be identified .
