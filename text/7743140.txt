Polychorodibenzo-p-dioxin and polychlorodibenzofuran ( PCDD/F ) and polychlorobiphenyl ( PCB ) concentrations were analyzed in fat samples of seven people from a village where the population had been exposed to chlorophenols for over twenty years , and in seven matched controls .
There was only a minor difference in both PCDD/F and PCB concentrations which seemed to reflect the general difference in background pollution between the locations .
We found nothing which could be construed as evidence of elevated levels of PCDD/Fs due to the chlorophenol exposure .
Hence any detrimental health effects must be considered as being due to chlorophenols rather than PCDD/F impurities .
