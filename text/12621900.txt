In an interdisciplinary approach the exposure to lead and cadmium of the population living in the vicinity of a Bulgarian non-ferrous metallurgical plant was studied to determine the routes of exposure .
Two exposed villages situated 4 and 6 km SW and W , respectively,--in the plume of the plant's emissions--and a village for comparison situated 14 km SE of the plant were selected for the study .
The blood of children aged 3-13 years from the exposed villages ( n = 111 ) and the village for comparison ( n = 18 ) was analyzed for lead ( PbB ) and cadmium ( CdB ) as well as for free erythrocyte protoporphyrin ( FEP ) and haematological parameters .
A personal questionnaire concerning nutrition habits and life-style was filled in by interviewers of the children's parents .
The cadmium levels in blood were within the variation range stated for Bulgaria .
The exposed children had a mean CdB of 0.38 +/- 0.18 microgram/l ( range 0.10-0.90 microgram/l ) and the comparison group 0.31 +/- 0.35 microgram/l ( 0.06-1.42 micrograms/l ) .
The mean PbB value measured in the exposed children was 240 +/- 96 micrograms/l ( 77-631 micrograms/l ) , while the mean value of PbB for the reference group was 149 +/- 57 micrograms/l ( 63-285 micrograms/l ) .
Individual PbB levels > 150 and > 200 micrograms/l were found in 85% and 62% , respectively , of the exposed children and FEP > 80 micrograms/dl erythrocytes was detected in 21% .
There was a concentration-response and a concentration-effect relationship ( r = 0.51 , D > 0.001 ) between PbB and FEP .
According to the questionnaire only 10.3% of the interviewed families in the two exposed villages buy all food from the market , the others produce a significant part of their food themselves .
The PbB levels of children who consume certain foods of local production ( cabbage , cereals , poultry , and beef ) were significantly higher compared to the PbB values of children whose families purchase these foods from the market .
No significant relationship between lead in children's blood and the use of tin and ceramic utensils , drinking and irrigation water , hygiene habits , family tobacco smoking habits , playgrounds and traffic intensity were revealed .
There was a significantly higher incidence of prematurely born babies in the exposed population .
The proven relationship between lead intake via the food chain and existing significant health risks is the basis for risk communication .
Measures aimed at healthier nutrition and life-style intend to contribute to decreasing the risk of the population living in the smelter region .
