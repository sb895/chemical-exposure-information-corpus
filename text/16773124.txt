Polychlorinated biphenyls used previously in industry are widespread environmental contaminants under scrutiny for their possible reproductive effects in humans .
In this study , 200 breast milk samples from eligible Victorian mothers were used for measuring maternal contamination and their possible effect on the offspring was investigated .
No significant association was found between maternal PCB contamination and low birth weight , small for gestational age and previous miscarriage or stillbirth .
The elevated odd ratios of prematurity , increased with increase in contamination level but were nonsignificant .
Higher PCB contamination was not in favor of any gender in the offspring .
Our results suggest that chronic , low contamination with PCBs does not pose a reproduction threat in humans .
