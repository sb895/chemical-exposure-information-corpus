BACKGROUND We conducted a population-based case-control study in Montreal , Canada , to explore associations between hundreds of occupational circumstances and several cancer sites , including colon .
METHODS We interviewed 497 male patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of colon cancer , 1514 controls with cancers at other sites , and 533 population-based controls .
Detailed job histories and relevant potential confounding variables were obtained , and the job histories were translated by a team of chemists and industrial hygienists into a history of occupational exposures .
RESULTS We found that there was reasonable evidence of associations for men employed in nine industry groups ( adjusted odds ranging from 1.1 to 1.6 per a 10-year increase in duration of employment ) , and in 12 job groups ( OR varying from 1.1 to 1.7 ) .
In addition , we found evidence of increased risks by increasing level of exposures to 21 occupational agents , including polystyrene ( OR for " substantial " exposure ( OR(subst) ) = 10.7 ) , polyurethanes ( OR(subst) = 8.4 ) , coke dust ( OR(subst) = 5.6 ) , mineral oils ( OR(subst) = 3.3 ) , polyacrylates ( OR(subst) = 2.8 ) , cellulose nitrate ( OR(subst) = 2.6 ) , alkyds ( OR(subst) = 2.5 ) , inorganic insulation dust ( OR(subst) = 2.3 ) , plastic dusts ( OR(subst) = 2.3 ) , asbestos ( OR(subst) = 2.1 ) , mineral wool fibers ( OR(subst) = 2.1 ) , glass fibers ( OR(subst) = 2.0 ) , iron oxides ( OR(subst) = 1.9 ) , aliphatic ketones ( OR(subst) = 1.9 ) , benzene ( OR(subst) = 1.9 ) , xylene ( OR(subst) = 1.9 ) , inorganic acid solutions ( OR(subst) = 1.8 ) , waxes , polishes ( OR(subst) = 1.8 ) , mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbons ( OR(subst) = 1.6 ) , toluene ( OR(subst) = 1.6 ) , and diesel engine emissions ( OR(subst) = 1.5 ) .
Not all of these effects are independent because some exposures occurred contemporaneously with others or because they referred to a group of substances .
CONCLUSIONS We have uncovered a number of occupational associations with colon cancer .
For most of these agents , there are no published data to support or refute our observations .
As there are few accepted risk factors for colon cancer , we suggest that new occupational and toxicologic studies be undertaken focusing on the more prevalent substances reported herein .
