This study investigated the extent of heavy metal accumulation in leaf vegetables and associated potential health risks in agricultural areas of the Pearl River Delta ( PRD ) , South China .
Total concentrations of mercury ( Hg ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , lead ( Pb ) , chromium ( Cr ) and arsenic ( As ) were determined in 92 pairs of soil and leaf vegetable ( flowering Chinese cabbage , lettuce , pakchoi , Chinese cabbage , loose-leaf lettuce , and Chinese leaf mustard ) samples collected from seven agricultural areas ( cities ) .
The bioconcentration factors ( BCF ) of heavy metals from soil to vegetables were estimated , and the potential health risks of heavy metal exposure to the PRD residents through consumption of local leaf vegetables were assessed .
Results showed that among the six leaf vegetables , pakchoi had the lowest capacity for heavy metal enrichment , whereas among the five heavy metals , Cd had the highest capacity for transferring from soil into vegetables , with BCF values 30-fold those of Hg and 50-fold those of Cr , Pb and As .
Sewage irrigation and fertilization were likely the main sources of heavy metals accumulated in leaf vegetables grown in agricultural areas of the PRD region .
Different from previous findings , soil pH had no clear effect on metal accumulation in leaf vegetables .
Despite a certain degree of metal enrichment from soil to leaf vegetables , the PRD residents were not exposed to significant health risks associated with consumption of local leaf vegetables .
Nevertheless , more attention should be paid to children due to their sensitivity to metal pollutants .
