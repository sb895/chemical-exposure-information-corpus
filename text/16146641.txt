Exposure to dioxins has raised much public concern recently .
We determined the congeners ' distribution of polychlorinated-dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( dl-PCBs ) in the breast milk samples collected in Tokyo , Japan .
Breast milk was taken from 240 mothers , 30 days after delivery in 1999 and 2000 in Tokyo , Japan .
The actual concentration and TEQ concentration of PCDDs ( 14 congeners ) , PCDFs ( 15 congeners ) , and dl-PCBs ( 12 congeners ) , and each congener's contribution to the total TEQ level were calculated .
Among all the samples , PCDDs accounted for 34.8% , PCDFs accounted for 23.5% , dl-PCBs accounted for 41.7% , which was also similar in the breast milk from the primiparae and secundiparae .
The main contributors to the total TEQ with increasing percentages were 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF , 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD and 3,3',4,4',5-PCB ( #126 ) , and they accounted for more than 65% of the total TEQ .
Detailed congener analysis in breast milk samples is effective to understand dioxin sources .
