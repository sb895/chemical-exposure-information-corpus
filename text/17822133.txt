In vitro and animal studies have reported endocrine-disrupting activity of chemicals used commonly as additives in cosmetics and skin care products .
We investigated whether diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) , dibutyl phthalate ( DBP ) , and butyl paraben ( BP ) were systemically absorbed and influenced endogenous reproductive and thyroid hormone levels in humans after topical application .
In a two-week single-blinded study , 26 healthy young male volunteers were assigned to daily whole-body topical application of 2 mg/cm2 basic cream formulation each without ( week one ) and with ( week two ) the three 2% ( w/w ) compounds .
The concentrations of BP and the main phthalate metabolites monoethyl ( MEP ) and monobutyl phthalate ( MBP ) were measured in serum together with the following reproductive hormones : follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , lutenising hormone ( LH ) , testosterone , estradiol , and inhibin B and thyroid hormones ( thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , free thyroxine ( FT4 ) , total triiodothyroxine ( T3 ) , and total thyroxine ( T4) ) .
MEP , MBP , and BP peaked in serum a few hours after application , reaching mean +/- SEM levels of 1001 +/- 81 microg/L , 51 +/- 6 microg/ L , and 135 +/- 11 microg/L , respectively .
Only MEP was detectable in serum before treatment .
Minor differences in inhibin B , LH , estradiol , T4 , FT4 , and TSH were observed between the two weeks , but these were not related to exposure .
We demonstrated for the first time that DEP , DBP , and BP could be systemically absorbed in man after topical application .
The systemic absorption of these compounds did not seem to have any short-term influence on the levels of reproductive and thyroid hormones in the examined young men .
