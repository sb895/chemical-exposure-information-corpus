We investigated the effect of lead , cadmium and mercury exposure on pregnancy and fertilization rate outcome among 619 Saudi women ( age 19-50 years ) who sought in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) treatment between 2002 and 2003 .
The concentrations of lead , cadmium and mercury were measured in both blood and follicular fluids .
At levels well below the current US occupational exposure limit guidelines ( 40microg/dL ) and even less than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention level of concern for preventing lead poisoning in children ( 10microg/dL ) , blood lead level was negatively associated with fertilization outcome in both adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models .
We found that among various demographic , socioeconomic and environmental factors , fish consumption was positively associated with blood lead levels .
These results support the hypothesis that a raised blood lead level affects infertility and intervention to reduce the lead exposure might be needed for women of reproductive age .
The present results also revealed unexpected finding - the positive relationship between follicular cadmium levels and fertilization outcome , which points to the necessity for further investigation .
Though adverse effect of mercury on pregnancy outcome or fertilization rate was not evident in this study , mercury5.8microg/L ( EPA safety limit ) was found in the blood and follicular fluid of 18.7% and 8.3% of the women , respectively .
Concerns about its possible adverse effects on the physiology of reproduction or fetal development cannot be ruled out .
It should be noted that skin-lightening creams and dental amalgam were important contributors to mercury exposure .
Such finding is alarming and priority for further studies are , urgently , needed .
