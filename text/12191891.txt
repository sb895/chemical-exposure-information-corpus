The aim of the study was to investigate the suitability of butoxyethoxyacetic acid ( BEAA ) as a biomarker of exposure to water-based cleaning agents containing diethylene glycol mono butyl ether ( DEGBE ) .
The study was performed in two printing plants where water-based products containing 10-15% DEGBE were used for rubber and blanket washes .
Thirty nine newspaper pressroom workers ( exposed ) and 19 employees of newspaper despatch departments ( controls ) were investigated .
By questionnaire , the workers were asked about the use of personal protective measures .
BEAA was determined in post-shift urine using GC-MS .
The BEAA concentration in the urine of exposed workers ranged up to 75.1 mg/l ( median 6.3 mg/l ) , whereas in urine samples of the controls the BEAA level was below or around the determination limit of 0.5 mg/l .
A protective effect on DEGBE uptake was observed with the use of protective gloves .
This observation implies that dermal penetration of DEGBE may be important in exposure monitoring .
