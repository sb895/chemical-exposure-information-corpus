BACKGROUND Chronic exposure to arsenic through drinking water has the potential to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes , although the association has not been demonstrated conclusively .
This cross-sectional study assessed the association between arsenic in drinking water and spontaneous abortion , stillbirth , and neonatal death .
METHODS In this cross-sectional study , 533 women were interviewed .
Information on sociodemographic characteristics , drinking water use , and adverse pregnancy outcomes was obtained through a structured pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire .
The respondents reported use of a total of 223 tube wells ; for 208 wells , water samples were measured using an ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry method , whereas 15 were measured by flow-injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry ( FIHG-AAS ) .
RESULTS Excess risks for spontaneous abortion and stillbirth were observed among the participants chronically exposed to higher concentrations of arsenic in drinking water after adjusting for participant's height , history of hypertension and diabetes , and ( for neonatal death only ) age at first pregnancy .
Comparing exposure to arsenic concentration of greater than 50 microg/L with 50 microg/L or less , the odds ratios were 2.5 ( 95% confidence interval=1.5-4.3 ) for spontaneous abortion , 2.5 ( 1.3-4.9 ) for stillbirth , and 1.8 ( 0.9-3.6 ) for neonatal death .
CONCLUSIONS These study findings suggest that chronic arsenic exposure may increase the risk of fetal and infant death .
