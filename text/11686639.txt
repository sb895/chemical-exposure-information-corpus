There is increasing concern about the potential neurotoxic effects of exposure to methylmercury for the 6 million people living in the Amazon , even in regions situated far away from the gold mines ( garimpos ) , considered to be the major source of mercury pollution .
In November 1998 , a spot investigation on mercury contamination was conducted in three fishing villages ( Barreiras , Rainha , and Sao Luiz do Tapajos ) on the Tapajos River , an effluent of the Amazon , situated several hundred kilometers downstream from the gold-mining areas .
A total of 132 fishermen and their families volunteered for the current study .
As was anticipated , the total mercury levels in the head hair collected from the fishing villages were relatively high ( 14.1-20.8 ppm on the average ) and the number of subjects with a high total mercury level over 10 ppm ( the least upper bound of a normal value ) was 103 ( 78.0% ) in total , along with various symptoms , thereby suggesting wide mercury contamination in the Tapajos River basin .
Moreover , in view of the absence of other diseases ( e.g. , alcoholism or malaria ) , a high intake of fish containing a methylmercury level , and high hair mercury levels in addition to the various symptoms such as sensory disturbance ( especially glove-and-stocking type , which is characteristic of Minamata disease ) , tremor , failure in two-point discrimination , and slight balancing failure , several subjects examined were diagnosed with mild Minamata disease .
The findings obtained suggest , thus , that the mercury pollution in the Amazon should be crucially observed for head hair mercury level and health in a much broader region .
