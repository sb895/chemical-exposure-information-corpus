Mercury exposures to smelting workers of artisanal mercury mines in Wuchuan , Guizhou , China were evaluated by urine and hair mercury survey .
The mean urinary mercury ( U-Hg ) , hair total mercury ( T-Hg ) , and hair methyl mercury ( Me-Hg ) for smelting workers was 1060 microg/g creatinine ( microg/g Cr ) , 69.3 and 2.32 microg/g , respectively .
The results were significantly higher than that of control group , which is 1.30 microg/g Cr , 0.78 and 0.65 microg/g , correspondingly .
The average urinary beta2-microglobulin ( beta2-MG ) was 248 microg/g Cr for the exposed group contrasting to 73.5 microg/g Cr for the control group and the data showed a serious adverse effect on renal system for the smelting workers .
The workers were exposed to mercury vapor through inhalation , and the exposure route of Me-Hg may be through intake of polluted diet .
The results indicate that age , alcohol drinking , and smoking are not crucial factors controlling the urine and hair mercury levels for the exposed and the control group .
Clinical symptoms including finger and eyelid tremor , gingivitis , and typical dark-line on gums were observed in six workers .
This study indicated that the smelting workers in Wuchuan were seriously exposed to mercury vapor .
