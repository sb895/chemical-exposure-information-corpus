The change in coexistence pattern of elements ( antagonism-synergism ) in conditions of excessive level of toxic element is observed in many biological samples .
The aim of this study was to establish the cadmium and zinc content in hard tissues of retained wisdom teeth of smokers and non-smokers and to find out if active exposure to cigarette smoke has an influence on coexistence of both metals in these tissues .
Material consisted of 127 retained wisdom teeth ( 65 from smokers and 62 from non-smokers ) .
Cadmium and zinc contents were determined by means of atomic absorption spectrometry .
We found out that retained wisdom tooth from smokers exhibited higher cadmium and zinc contents compared to non-smokers ' teeth .
Moreover , coexistence pattern of cadmium and zinc in teeth depends on exposure to heavy metals and exhibits strong synergism in smokers .
