OBJECTIVES Exposure to mercury , a risk factor for neuro-developmental toxicity , was evaluated in the Czech Republic by performing mercury determination using human hair as an indicator .
METHODS Hair samples from Czechs ( n=311 ; 2-66 years old ) were analyzed for mercury content .
Total mercury was analysed by mercury analyzer AMA 254 .
RESULTS The highest total mercury content found in sampled hair was 3.55 microg/g and the lowest content was 0.015 microg/g .
No correlation was found between the mercury levels in the sampled hair and the subject's age , gender , and the amount of amalgam fillings .
A total of 38 hair samples were analyzed for methylmercury content .
CONCLUSION The results show a positive correlation between the total mercury content in human hair and the consumption of marine and freshwater fish .
Hair are a very good indicator of fish consumption .
