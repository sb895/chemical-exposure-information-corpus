Benzene is a solvent strictly related to some industrial activities and to automotive emissions .
After the reduction in lead content of fuel gasoline , and the consequent decrease in octane number , an increase in benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline occurred .
Therefore , an increase in the concentration of these chemicals in the air as primary pollutants and as precursors of photochemical smog could occur in the future .
The objectives of this study were to describe the benzene air pollution at three sites in northwestern Italy throughout 1991 and 1994 ; to examine the relationship between benzene air pollution in indoor , outdoor , and personal air as measured by a group of nonsmoking university students ; and to determine the influence of environmental tobacco smoke on the level of benzene exposure in indoor air environments .
The results indicate a direct relationship between population density and levels of contamination ; an indoor/outdoor ratio of benzene air pollution higher than 1 during day and night ; a similar level of personal and indoor air contamination ; and a direct relationship between levels of personal exposure to benzene and intensity of exposure to tobacco smoke .
Human exposure to airborne benzene has been found to depend principally on indoor air contamination not only in the home but also in many other confined environments .
