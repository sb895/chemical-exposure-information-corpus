BACKGROUND Few prospective studies have evaluated the influence of arsenic methylation capacity on cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk.Objective : We evaluated the association of arsenic exposure from drinking water and arsenic methylation capacity with CVD risk .
METHOD We conducted a case-cohort study of 369 incident fatal and nonfatal cases of CVD , including 211 cases of heart disease and 148 cases of stroke , and a subcohort of 1,109 subjects randomly selected from the 11,224 participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study ( HEALS ) .
RESULTS The adjusted hazard ratios ( aHRs ) for all CVD , heart disease , and stroke in association with a 1-SD increase in baseline well-water arsenic ( 112 Âµg/L ) were 1.15 ( 95% CI : 1.01 , 1.30 ) , 1.20 ( 95% CI : 1.04 , 1.38 ) , and 1.08 ( 95% CI : 0.90 , 1.30 ) , respectively. aHRs for the second and third tertiles of percentage urinary monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA% ) relative to the lowest tertile , respectively , were 1.27 ( 95% CI : 0.85 , 1.90 ) and 1.55 ( 95% CI : 1.08 , 2.23 ) for all CVD , and 1.65 ( 95% CI : 1.05 , 2.60 ) and 1.61 ( 95% CI : 1.04 , 2.49 ) for heart disease specifically .
The highest versus lowest ratio of urinary dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) to MMA was associated with a significantly decreased risk of CVD ( aHR = 0.54 ; 95% CI : 0.34 , 0.85 ) and heart disease ( aHR = 0.54 ; 95% CI : 0.33 , 0.88 ) .
There was no significant association between arsenic metabolite indices and stroke risk .
The effects of incomplete arsenic methylation capacity--indicated by higher urinary MMA% or lower urinary DMA%--with higher levels of well-water arsenic on heart disease risk were additive .
There was some evidence of a synergy of incomplete methylation capacity with older age and cigarette smoking .
CONCLUSIONS Arsenic exposure from drinking water and the incomplete methylation capacity of arsenic were adversely associated with heart disease risk .
