BACKGROUND This is a community comparison study that examines persons living in a subdivision exposed to petroleum products and mercury .
METHODS We compared their health status and questionnaire responses to those living in another community with no known exposures of this type .
RESULTS Pristane house dust among the exposed homes was higher than in the comparison communities .
The exposed subdivision has higher ambient air mercury levels compared to the control community .
The prevalence of rheumatic diseases ( OR = 10.78 ; CI = 4.14 , 28.12 ) and lupus ( OR = 19.33 ; CI = 1.96 , 190.72 ) was greater in the exposed population compared to the unexposed .
A higher prevalence of neurological symptoms , respiratory symptoms and several cardiovascular problems including stroke ( OR = 15.41 ; CI = 0.78 , 304.68 ) and angina ( OR = 5.72 ; CI = 1.68 , 19.43 ) was seen .
CONCLUSION There were statistically significant differences in B cells , Natural Killer Cells , gamma glutamyl transferase , globulin and serum calcium levels between control and exposed subjects .
