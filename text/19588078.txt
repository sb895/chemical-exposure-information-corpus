In the present study , the association of arsenic , cadmium , lead , and nickel between scalp hair samples and mortality from myocardial infarction ( MI ) patients at first , second , and third heart attack was studied .
The biological samples of 130 MI patients ( 77 male and 53 female ) age ranged ( 45-60 years ) , were collected and 61 healthy persons of same age group ( 33 male and 28 female ) was selected as control subjects .
The toxic elements ( TEs ) in biological samples were assessed by the electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry prior to microwave-assisted acid digestion .
The validity of methodology was checked by the certified human hair reference material ( BCR 397 ) .
It was observed during the study that 78% of 32 patients of the third MI , age >50 years were expired .
In these subjects , the level of As , Cd , Ni , and Pb were increased by 10.6% , 19.5% , 15.7% , and 9.8% in the scalp hair as compared to those who tolerated third MI attack ( p = 0.12 ) .
The high level of toxic metals may play a role in the development of heart disease in the subjects of this study .
