Urinary arsenic ( inorganic arsenic and methylated metabolites ) , uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin I and III isomers were determined in 84 smelter workers exposed to arsenic trioxide and in 22 non-exposed controls .
Both ' high ' and ' low ' exposure groups were defined , based on individual's work area ( arsenic recovery plant and maintenance ) and mean urinary excretion of arsenic was compared to the control group ( 257 and 129 micrograms/g creatinine against 9.9 micrograms/g creatinine ) .
Total coproporphyrin ( I+III ) increased in each exposure group as compared to control ( 63.3 and 59 micrograms/g creatinine against 27.2 micrograms/g creatinine ) , as a consequence of a 2-fold increase in each coproporphyrin isomer .
The mean concentration of uroporphyrin in each exposure group was very similar to that of the non-exposed controls ( 9.5 and 8.8 micrograms/g creatinine against 10.7 micrograms/g creatinine ) .
These results suggest that long-term occupational exposure of humans to arsenic is associated with coproporphyrinuria and raise the question of the use of this parameter in addition to urinary arsenic for biological monitoring .
