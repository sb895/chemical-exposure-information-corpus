PURPOSE A scientific review panel for the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently identified the need for more data on the health risk of mercury exposure from dental amalgam among susceptible populations .
We evaluated impacts of low-level mercury exposure on renal function and neurobehavioral and neuropsychological performance among children .
METHODS Dental histories for 403 children aged 7-11 years in five schools from Xuhui , Shanghai were checked by dentists .
Of them , 198 with confirmed amalgam fillings were recruited ( exposure group ) .
Reference children ( N=205 ) were those who never had dental amalgam treatment .
In May 2004 , each child provided a urine sample for measurements of total mercury , N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity , microalbumin , and creatinine ( Cr ) .
The Child Behavior Checklist , Eysenck Personality Questionnaire , and an intelligence screening test were administered .
RESULTS The geometric mean urinary mercury concentration was 1.6 microg/g Cr for children with and 1.4 microg/g Cr for children without amalgam fillings .
No differences were found between children with and without fillings for either renal function biomarker , or on neurobehavioral , neuropsychological , or intelligence tests .
CONCLUSIONS Although urinary mercury concentration was slightly elevated among children with amalgam fillings , we found no evidence of adverse effects on the outcomes evaluated .
These results agree with those from recent trials in developed countries .
