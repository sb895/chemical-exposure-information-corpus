BACKGROUND In utero exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls , a ubiquitous environmental contaminant , has been linked to adverse effects on neurologic and intellectual function in infants and young children .
We assessed whether these effects persist through school age and examined their importance in the acquisition of reading and arithmetic skills .
METHODS We tested 212 children , recruited as newborns to overrepresent infants born to women who had eaten Lake Michigan fish contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls .
A battery of IQ and achievement tests was administered when the children were 11 years of age .
Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls in maternal serum and milk at delivery were slightly higher than in the general population .
A composite measure of prenatal exposure was derived from concentrations in umbilical-cord serum and maternal serum and milk .
RESULTS Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls was associated with lower full-scale and verbal IQ scores after control for potential confounding variables such as socioeconomic status ( P = 0.02 ) .
The strongest effects related to memory and attention .
The most highly exposed children were three times as likely to have low average IQ scores ( P <0.001 ) and twice as likely to be at least two years behind in reading comprehension ( P = 0.03 ) .
Although larger quantities of polychlorinated biphenyls are transferred by breast-feeding than in utero , there were deficits only in associated with transplacental exposure , suggesting that the developing fetal brain is particularly sensitive to these compounds .
CONCLUSIONS In utero exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls in concentrations slightly higher than those in the general population can have a long-term impact on intellectual function .
