Median concentration of total PBDEs in maternal serum , paternal serum , umbilical cord serum , and breast milk samples were 12 , 12 , 17 , and 6.1 ng/g lipid weight ( lw ) in Vallecas and 9.7 , 12 , 15 , and 5.5 ng/g lw in Getafe .
The median value found in placentas was 1.9 ng/g lw ( in Vallecas ) .
BDE 47 was the predominant congener in serum samples ( maternal , paternal , and umbilical cord ) , while BDE 209 was predominant in placenta and breast milk samples .
BDEs 196 and 197 were detected in most of the placenta and breast milk samples .
The results show that PBDEs , like other POPs , can cross the placenta barrier , although the speed of the process seems to differ for each PBDE congeners .
The total PBDE concentrations found in this study are consistent with research reported elsewhere .
They are in the same range as those recently reported by other European and Asian studies and lower than those conducted in the U.S.A. No significant differences were found ( p > 0.05 ) between regions , sexes , and ages , while statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) were found between maternal serum , umbilical cord serum , and breast milk samples .
The presence of PBDEs in cord blood and placenta samples indicates that there is prenatal exposure of PBDEs , which could continue after birth via breast milk .
