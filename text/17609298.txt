Although regional differences in semen parameters have been described , little is known about the etiologic factors underlying these variations in male fertility status .
We previously reported people from a rural area ( Peer ) in Flanders to have lower sperm parameters and free testosterone than men from the city of Antwerp .
In the present study , our objectives were to investigate to what extent these differences were associated with lifestyle or environmental factors .
People in Peer were slightly older and had a higher body mass index , factors known to affect testosterone concentrations but not sperm parameters .
People consuming locally produced vegetables ( n = 37 of 94 ) but not fruit had significantly lower serum free testosterone and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) ( both P = .04 ) and nonsignificantly lower follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) ( P = .05 ) .
Per unit increase of monthly intake of locally produced vegetables , free testosterone declined by 0.7% ( P = .01 ) and sperm concentration by 2.3% ( P = .04 ) over the whole range of the explanatory variable , whereas LH declined by 3.6% ( P = .02 ) , FSH declined by 3.5% ( P = .08 ) , and sperm morphology by 7% ( P = .002 ) in the range of 0-10 consumptions per month .
No relationship was found with lifelong exposure to cadmium .
These results support a hypothesis of impaired gonadotropic signaling causing the regional difference in reproductive parameters .
The surprising strong impact of self-grown vegetable consumption did not seem to be related to soil contamination by cadmium .
We could not exclude pesticide exposure by inappropriate application or other factors such as nutritional deficiency , physical activity , or stress as contributors to the observed regional differences .
