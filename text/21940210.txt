This manuscript presents highlights of recent studies and perspectives from the French human biomonitoring ( HBM ) programme .
Until recently , HBM studies focused on specific populations or pollutants to gain a better understanding of exposure to environmental chemicals , to help regulators reduce environmental exposure and to monitor existing policies on specific concerns .
Highlights of recent multicentre biomonitoring studies with specific population or pollutant focus are given .
These French HBM studies have been implemented to know : ( 1 ) the influence of living near an incinerator on serum dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) levels , ( 2 ) the influence of consuming river fish contaminated by PCBs on serum PCBs of fishermen , and ( 3 ) the evolution of blood lead levels in children from 1 to 6 years old since 1995 .
Special emphasis is placed on the use of an integrated ( HBM coupled with nutrition and health studies ) , multipollutant approach .
This approach has been initiated in France with a recent national population-based biomonitoring survey , the Etude Nationale Nutrition Santé ( ENNS ; French Nutrition and Health Survey ) .
This survey will provide the first reference distribution for 42 biomarkers in the French population .
The current national HBM strategy will build upon the ENNS and include a national survey of people aged between 6 and 74 years complemented for the neonatal period and childhood by the Etude Longitudinale Française depuis l'Enfance ( ELFE ; French longitudinal study of children ) .
France also contributes to the harmonization of HBM activities in Europe through participation in European HBM projects .
