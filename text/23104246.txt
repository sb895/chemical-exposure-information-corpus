Inorganic arsenic , a human carcinogen , can be found in the environment and food .
In the first Hong Kong Total Diet Study , the dietary exposure of the Hong Kong people , including various age-gender subgroups , to inorganic arsenic was estimated for assessing the associated health risk .
Food samples , which represented the Hong Kong people's diet , were collected and prepared " as consumed " for analysis .
Concentrations of inorganic arsenic , as sum of arsenite ( As(III) ) and arsenate ( As(V) ) were determined in 600 composite samples by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .
The dietary exposures were estimated by combining the analytical results with the local food consumption data of the adult population .
The mean and 95th percentile of inorganic arsenic exposures of the Hong Kong people were 0.22 and 0.38\u03bcg/kg body weight ( bw)/day , respectively .
Among the 12 age-gender subgroups , the respective exposures ranged from 0.19 to 0.26\u03bcg/kg bw/day and from 0.33 to 0.46\u03bcg/kg bw/day .
The main food category that contributed inorganic arsenic was " cereals and their products " ( 53.5% of the total exposure ) , particularly rice .
Having considered the carcinogenic risk of inorganic arsenic to humans , it is suggested that efforts should be made to reduce the inorganic arsenic exposure of the Hong Kong population .
