In this prospective cohort study , based on 1,505 mother-infant pairs in rural Bangladesh , we evaluated the associations between early-life exposure to arsenic , cadmium , and lead , assessed via concentrations in maternal and child urine , and children's weights and heights up to age 5 years , during the period 2001-2009 .
Concurrent and prenatal exposures were evaluated using linear regression analysis , while longitudinal exposure was assessed using mixed-effects linear regression .
An inverse association was found between children's weight and height , age-adjusted z scores , and growth velocity at age 5 years and concurrent exposure to cadmium and arsenic .
In the longitudinal analysis , multivariable-adjusted attributable differences in children's weight at age 5 years were -0.33 kg ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : -0.60 , -0.06 ) for high ( \u226595th percentile ) arsenic exposure and -0.57 kg ( 95% CI : -0.88 , -0.26 ) for high cadmium exposure , in comparison with children with the lowest exposure ( \u22645th percentile ) .
Multivariable-adjusted attributable differences in height were -0.50 cm ( 95% CI : -1.20 , 0.21 ) for high arsenic exposure and -1.6 cm ( 95% CI : -2.4 , -0.77 ) for high cadmium exposure .
The associations were apparent primarily among girls .
The negative effects on children's growth at age 5 years attributable to arsenic and cadmium were of similar magnitude to the difference between girls and boys in terms of weight ( -0.67 kg , 95% CI : -0.82 , -0.53 ) and height ( -1.3 cm , 95% CI : -1.7 , -0.89 ) .
