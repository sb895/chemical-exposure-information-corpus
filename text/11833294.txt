Frequently , patients in environmental health out-patient units relate various complaints to their amalgam fillings .
However , an association between the toxic exposure and the reported complaints appears plausible only in few cases .
We investigated toxicological , allergological and psychological parameters in patients with amalgam-associated complaints and compared them to controls with similar numbers of amalgam fillings .
Forty patients with health disturbances related to amalgam were compared to a control group without amalgam-associated complaints ( n = 40 ) , carefully matched for age , sex , and dental status .
Mercury concentrations were analyzed in blood , saliva , and 24-h-urine .
Atopic predisposition , determination of IgE , patch testing with amalgam and amalgam-associated metals and a psychometric assessment were performed in all participants .
Mercury concentrations in blood or urine were similar in patients and controls .
Atopic predisposition was markedly enhanced in patients ( 11/40 ) as compared to controls ( 5/40 ) .
Only one patient with a lichen ruber of the oral mucosa showed a contact sensitization to amalgam .
Patients reported more psychic strain and higher depression scores than controls .
Somatization disorders were found in 10 patients ( 25% ) and in one control .
Eighteen patients ( 45% ) neither showed an atopic predisposition nor an influence of psychosocial factors .
Toxic exposure to mercury does not appear to play a role in " amalgam disease " .
Since many of these patients are atopic without an " amalgam allergy " , but with more psychic strain and notably more depression , the treatment should be focused on allergologic and psychological factors .
