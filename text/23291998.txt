OBJECTIVE To assess potential arsenic ( As ) contamination of work surfaces to improve upon the control strategy at an anthropology department in a large natural history museum .
METHODS Work practices were observed and control strategy reviewed to inform an occupational hygiene assessment strategy utilizing surface wipe sampling .
A total of 35 sampling targets were identified , focusing on surfaces that receive high touch traffic , including workstations , artifact transport carts , and elevator buttons .
Arsenic sampling and analysis were performed using reference method Occupational Safety and Health Administration ID-125G .
RESULTS Four of the sampling areas returned detectable levels of As , ranging from 0.052 to 0.350 \u03bcg/100 cm .
CONCLUSION Workplace observations and wipe sampling data enabled the development of recommendations to help to further reduce potential occupational exposure to As .
Continuous reduction of surface contamination is prudent for known human carcinogens .
