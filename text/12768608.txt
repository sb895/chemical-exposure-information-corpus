OBJECTIVE Organic dust exposure and work-related symptoms and effects among household waste recycling workers in Materials Recovery Facilities ( MRFs ) are a concern .
MRFs are a central operation where source-segregated , dry , recyclable materials ( paper , plastics , cans , etc. ) are sorted , mechanically or manually , to market specifications for processing into secondary materials .
METHODS One hundred and fifty-nine MRF workers ( 91% ) from nine MRFs participated .
Measurements of airborne total dust , endotoxin , ( 1-->3)-beta-D-glucan , and a questionnaire survey were carried out .
Blood data was restricted to MRFs 3 , 6 , and 9 ( 45 workers ) .
Blood sampling investigated differential cell counts , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , and immunoglobulin ( Ig)E .
RESULTS Workers exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and ( 1-->3)-beta-D-glucan had an increased risk for respiratory symptoms as compared to those with lower exposure .
Stomach problems was associated to higher ( 1-->3)-beta-D-glucan exposure .
MRF 3 had a higher ( 1-->3)-beta-d-glucan exposure compared to 6 and 9 , and respiratory symptoms , unusual tiredness , and vomiting were reported more often in MRF 3 .
Monocyte numbers and ESR were significantly decreased in MRF 3 compared to MRF 6 and 9 , but all measured values were within normal ranges .
CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that MRF workers exposed to higher levels of endotoxin and ( 1-->3)-beta-D-glucan at their work sites exhibit various work-related symptoms , and that the longer a worker is in the MRF environment , the more likely he is to become affected by various respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms .
