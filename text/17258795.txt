OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to investigate the chronic mercury intoxication in pregnant women and newborns living in Istanbul , Turkey .
METHODS The research was carried out as a prospective with 143 pregnant women and their newborns .
Venous blood from the mother , cord blood from the neonate , and meconium were collected for mercury analysis .
Frequency of fish and vegetable-eating and the number of teeth filled were investigated .
Analyses were made in cold vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer ( AAS , microg/L ) .
RESULTS Mercury levels were 0.38+/-0.5 microg/L ( 0-2.34 ) in venous blood of pregnant women , 0.50+/-0.64 microg/L ( 0-2.36 ) in umbilical cord blood and 9.45+/-13.8 microg/g ( 0-66.5 ) in meconium .
Maternal blood mercury level was lower than the known toxic limit for humans ( EPA , 5 microg/L ) .
Mercury levels of the maternal venous blood were significantly correlated with umbilical cord blood .
The primary risk factors affecting mercury levels were eating fishmeals more than twice a week and having filled teeth more than five .
The fact that the mother had a regular vegetable diet everyday reduced the mercury levels .
Increased levels of mercury in the mother and umbilical cord blood could lead to retarded newborns ' weight and height .
CONCLUSION Pregnant women living in Istanbul may be not under the risk of chronic mercury intoxication .
Fish consumption more than twice per week and tooth-filling of mother more than five may increase mercury level .
On the contrary , regular diet rich in vegetable decreases the mercury level .
