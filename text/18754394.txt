Temporal biomonitoring studies can assess changes in population exposures to contaminants , but collection of biological specimens with adequate representation and sufficient temporal resolution can be resource-intensive .
Newborn Screening Programs ( NSPs ) collect blood as dried spots on filter paper from nearly all infants born in the United States ( U.S. ) .
In this study , we investigated the use of NSP blood spots for temporal biomonitoring by analyzing perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) , perfluorooctane sulfonamide ( PFOSA ) , perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS ) , perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , and perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) in 110 New York State ( NYS ) NSP blood spot composite specimens collected between 1997 and 2007 , representing a total of 2640 infants .
All analytes were detected in > or =90% of the specimens .
Concentrations of PFOS , PFOSA , PFHxS , and PFOA exhibited significant exponential declines after the year 2000 , coinciding with the phase-out in PFOS production in the U.S. Calculated disappearance half-lives for PFOS , PFHxS , and PFOA ( 4.4 , 8.2 , and 4.1 years , respectively ) were similar to biological half-lives reported for retired fluorochemical workers .
Our results suggest sharp decreases in perinatal exposure of NYS infants to PFOS , PFOSA , PFHxS , and PFOA and demonstrate , for the first time , the utility of NSP blood spots for assessment of temporal trends in exposure .
