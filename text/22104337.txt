With the objective to evaluate exposure of the population in Flanders ( Belgium ) to perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) , we measured perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) in settled dust in homes and offices , in a selection of food items from local origin , in drinking-water and in human serum .
We complemented the data with results from a literature survey .
Based on this dataset we calculated intake by children and adults from food , drinking-water , settled dust and soil , and air .
Dietary exposure dominated overall intake .
For adults , average dietary intake equalled 24.2 ( P95 40.9 ) ng PFOS kg(-1) d(-1) and 6.1 ( P95 9.6 ) ng PFOA kg(-1)d(-1) , whereas for children the dietary intake was about 3 times higher .
Predicted intake is high when compared to assessments in other countries , and to serum levels from Flanders , but comparable to the intakes published by The European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) in 2008 .
Intake of PFOS and PFOA remained below the Tolerable Daily Intake .
