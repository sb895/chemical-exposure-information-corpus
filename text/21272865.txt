Excessive urinary calcium excretion is the major risk of urinary stone formation .
Very few population studies have been performed to determine the relationship between environmental cadmium exposure and urinary stone disease .
This population-based study examined an association between urinary cadmium excretion , a good biomarker of long-term cadmium exposure , and prevalence of urinary stones in persons aged 15 years and older , who lived in the 12 cadmium-contaminated villages in the Mae Sot District , Tak Province , northwestern Thailand .
A total of 6748 persons were interviewed and screened for urinary cadmium and urinary stone disease in 2009 .
To test a correlation between urinary excretion of cadmium and calcium , we measured urinary calcium content in 1492 persons , who lived in 3 villages randomly selected from the 12 contaminated villages .
The rate of urinary stones significantly increased from 4.3% among persons in the lowest quartile of urinary cadmium to 11.3% in the highest quartile .
An increase in stone prevalence with increasing urinary cadmium levels was similarly observed in both genders .
Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a positive association between urinary cadmium levels and stone prevalence , after adjusting for other co-variables .
The urinary calcium excretion significantly increased with increasing urinary cadmium levels in both genders , after adjusting for other co-variables .
Elevated calciuria induced by cadmium might increase the risk of urinary stone formation in this environmentally exposed population .
