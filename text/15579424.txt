DDT ( dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ) , a pesticide once used widely in agriculture and now limited to public health use , remains a controversial chemical because of a combination of benefits and risks .
DDT or its breakdown products are ubiquitous in the environment and in humans .
Compounds in the DDT family have endocrine actions and have been associated with reproductive toxicity .
A previous study reported associations between prenatal exposure to p,p -DDE [ 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene ] and increased height and weight in adolescent boys .
We examined a group with higher exposures to see whether similar associations would occur .
Our study group was 304 males born in Philadelphia in the early 1960s who had participated in a previous study .
Anthropometric and pubertal measures from one to six visits during their adolescent years were available , as were stored maternal serum samples from pregnancy .
We measured p,p -DDE , p,p -DDT [ 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane ] , and o,p -DDT [ 1,1,1-trichloro-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane ] in the maternal serum .
Outcomes examined in the boys were height , ratio of sitting height to height , body mass index , triceps skinfold thickness , ratio of subscapular to the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses , skeletal age , serum testosterone , and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate .
No associations between prenatal exposure to any of the DDT compounds and any outcome measure were seen .
