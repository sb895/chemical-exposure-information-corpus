Our objective was to evaluate the temporal evolution of mercury exposure in two riverside communities , Barreiras and São Luiz do Tapajós , downstream of gold mining areas in the Tapajós basin , Brazilian Amazon .
The quantification of mercury in hair sample was made by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the period between 1994 and 2010 .
In São Luiz do Tapajós the mercury exposure varied , in log units , from the peak of 1.21±0.03μg/g in 1996 to 1.16±0.07μg/g in 2007 .
Mercury exposure in Barreiras varied , in log units , from 1.25±0.04μg/g in 1994 to 1±0.03μg/g in 2010 , peaking in 1995 at 1.25±0.06μg/g .
Total mercury concentration found in both communities had no statistical differences across the years ( p>0.05 ) and they were higher than non-mercury exposed communities in Brazil and in South America .
We concluded that the mercury exposure in the Tapajós basin is more than regulatory levels or higher than the general population .
