Existence of arsenic-rich ( exceeds 2,000 mg/kg ) iron pyrite in Bengal delta sediments is responsible for arsenic release in aquifer .
Ingestion of contaminated drinking water is not the only elevated source of arsenic to the diet .
Irrigation of agricultural fields with arsenic-contaminated groundwater has led to arsenic build-up in soil , with subsequent elevation of arsenic in crops grown on these soils .
About 50.7 and 11.2 kg of arsenic are withdrawn per year from 23 and 18 shallow tubewells , used for agricultural irrigation in the studied two districts Murshidabad and Nadia , respectively and deposited on lands throughout the year .
Considerable higher amounts of arsenic are accumulated in paddy plants .
Mean arsenic concentration in food categories is 107 microg/kg .
Arsenic concentrations are high in cooked food and skin of the vegetables .
Arsenic concentration in cooked rice increases with water arsenic concentration .
About 70.2% of arsenic is recovered by using the analytical speciation extraction method .
Inorganic arsenic and DMA contribute 89.5% and 10.5% of the total content of arsenic in food , respectively .
About 0.081% and 1.57% of arsenic are accumulated in rice grain from arsenic-deposited lands and contaminated soils .
The daily dietary intake of inorganic arsenic ( mug/kg body wt./day ) by an adult from rice grain itself ( 2.32 ) is higher than the WHO recommended PTDI value of inorganic arsenic ( 2.1 ) and inorganic arsenic contributes 96.8% of the total dietary intakes of arsenic .
Population exposed to arsenic toxicity has been identified .
