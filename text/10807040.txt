The aim of this study was : ( a ) to estimate the concentration of total mercury in the renal cortex , liver , cerebellum and hair of 46 persons who died suddenly in the Gda\u0144sk region , northern Poland , between the ages of 17 and 90 ; and ( b ) to assess whether a correlation occurs between mercury content in the investigated biological media .
The mean concentrations of mercury in the human hair , renal cortex , liver and cerebellum were : 378 +/- 315.4 ng/g ; 68.6 +/- 92.3 ng/g ; 29.9 +/- 22 ng/g and 5.3 +/- 6.9 ng/g respectively .
Positive correlations were found between mercury levels in : cerebellum and liver ( r = 0.873 ) , cerebellum and hair ( r = 0.853 ) , cerebellum and renal cortex ( r = 0.578 ) , hair and liver ( r = 0.771 ) , hair and renal cortex ( r = 0.478 ) liver and renal cortex ( r = 0.66 ) .
The geometric mean levels of mercury in the renal cortex , liver , cerebellum and hair in the residents of the Gda\u0144sk region are 15-19 times lower than in the population of Tokyo and its environs [ Suzuki T , Hongo T , Yoshinaga J et al .
