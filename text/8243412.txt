A previous study of 16 pesticide applicators showed that N-acetylglucosaminidase ( NAG ) excretion during exposure to the soil nematocide , 1,3-dichloropropene ( DCP ) , was correlated with DCP dose and the excretion of its major metabolite , N-acetyl-S-(cis-3-chloroprop-2-enyl)-cysteine ( 3CNAC ) .
Using the same urine samples , two other proteins were measured : low concentrations of albumin ( "microalbuminuria, " ALB ) and retinol-binding protein ( RBP ) .
For each worker there were five consecutive urine collection intervals ( 6-8 hr each ) : overnight prior to exposure , morning work shift , afternoon work shift , evening after work , and overnight .
Paired comparisons of each interval to baseline ( first interval ) for each protein excretion ( creatinine corrected ) did not reveal significant increases .
However , amounts of renal proteins per interval , in contrast to creatinine-corrected concentrations , were more strongly correlated with each other and with 3CNAC concentrations within samples .
Clear dichotomous differences in urinary protein excretion were seen for high versus low exposure ( < or > 1.5 mg 3CNAC excretion/day ) for NAG and RBP , but not for ALB .
Based on earlier findings of a slight elevation of NAG and the minimal changes reported herein for RBP , the possible effects of short-term workplace exposure to DCP on renal protein excretion appear to be mild .
