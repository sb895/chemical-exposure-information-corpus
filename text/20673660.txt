Riverine populations of the Brazilian Amazon depend on fish for their principal source of protein , which changes in availability with seasonal fluctuations in the aquatic ecosystem .
We report seasonal ( high and low waters ) and interannual changes in total mercury and methylmercury concentrations in hair of subsistence fish-eaters from a traditional riverine village on the banks of the Rio Tapaj√≥s in the Brazilian Amazonia .
Retrospective exposure assessment was conducted from hair concentrations in segments representative of 2 years .
A total of 32 mothers and their 51 children were studied .
They reported high fish consumption ( 4-14 times a week ) .
Ranges of total mercury and methylmercury concentrations in hair were 1.0-51.0 and 0.5-41.4microgg(-1) , with means of 12.4 and 10.2microgg(-1) , respectively .
The relative mean value for methylmercury was 80% .
There was a significant correlation between mothers and children for both total-Hg ( r=0.4826 ; P=0.003 ) and methyl-Hg ( r=0.5214 ; P=0.004 ) .
Mercury concentrations along hair strands of individuals showed significant variation coinciding with seasonal high and low waters .
The changes in the aquatic environment impacted fish species availability , which is reflected in the total and MeHg concentrations in hair .
