Bisphenol-A ( BPA ) and chlorinated derivatives ( Cl(x)BPA ) were investigated in adipose tissue of women in Southeast Spain .
BPA was above limit of detection ( LOD ) in 11 out of 20 samples ( 55% ) .
Among Cl(x)BPA , Cl(2)BPA was the most frequent ( 80% ) and abundant , constituting 94.6% of total chlorinated BPA in adipose tissue .
Mean +/- S.D. of BPA , monochloro-BPA ( ClBPA ) , dichloro-BPA ( Cl(2)BPA ) , and trichloro-BPA ( Cl(3)BPA ) were 5.83 +/- 3.48 , 3.05 +/- 0.28 , 9.21 +/- 9.26 , and 0.74 +/- 0.15 ng/g of adipose tissue , respectively .
No tetrachloro-BPA ( Cl(4)BPA ) was found above LOD .
There are no published data on BPA in human adipose tissue or on Cl(x)BPA in adipose tissue or blood , limiting comparisons .
BPA levels were similar ( w/w ) to findings in blood ( w/v ) in other populations and below levels reported in placenta tissue ( w/w ) .
Because of the estrogen mimicking effects of BPA and its Cl(x)BPA , further research is needed to explore their combined effects on human health and trends in human exposure .
