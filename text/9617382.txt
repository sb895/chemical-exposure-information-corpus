BACKGROUND We conducted a population-based case-control study to describe the relationship between occupational exposure to estrogenic chemicals and the occurrence of breast cancer in Cape Cod , Massachusetts .
METHODS Incident cases of breast cancer ( n = 261 ) diagnosed from 1983 through 1986 and controls ( n = 753 ) were interviewed to gather information on breast cancer risk factors and all full-time jobs held since age 18 .
Blinded exposure assessments were employed using the data from the NIOSH National Occupational Exposure Survey , chemical production and usage information , and the expert judgement of a certified industrial hygienist .
RESULTS Overall , 29.5% of cases and 32.5% of controls had probable occupational exposure to one or more xenoestrogens .
Probable exposure to nonylphenol ( 21.5% of cases , 21.4% of controls ) , butyl benzyl phthalate ( 10.0% of cases , 13.2% of controls ) , BHA ( 7.3% of cases , 9.6% of controls ) , bisphenol A ( 9.6% of cases , 11.6% of controls ) , and 4-tert-butylphenol ( 2.7% of cases and 5.3% of controls ) were relatively commons , while probable exposure to the other xenestrogens was rare .
Only PCBs and 4-octylphenol were associated with moderate increase in the odds of breast cancer ( PCBs : 5 exposed cases and 6 exposed controls , adjust odds ratio : 3.2 , 95% CI = 0.8-12.2 , and 4-octylphenol : 6 exposed cases and 5 exposed controls , adjusted odds ratio : 2.9 , 95% CI = 10.8 ) .
