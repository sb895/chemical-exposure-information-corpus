Yusho disease , a polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran ( PCDF ) mixed poisoning caused by contaminated rice oil , occurred in Japan in 1968 .
The evidence on reproductive outcome is limited .
We therefore evaluated the regional impact of the exposure to the PCB and PCDF mixture on stillbirth rate and secondary sex ratio among the residents in two severely affected areas .
We selected the regionally-affected towns of Tamanoura ( n=4390 in 1970 ) and Naru ( n=6569 ) in Nagasaki Prefecture , Japan , for study .
We obtained data on stillbirths ( spontaneous/artificial ) and live-born births ( total/male/female ) from 1958 to 1994 .
For a decade and a half after the exposure , an increase in the rate of spontaneous stillbirths coincided with a decrease in the male sex ratio .
Compared with the years 1958-1967 , the ratios for spontaneous stillbirth rates were 2.16 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.58 to 2.97 ) for 1968-1977 and 1.80 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.25 to 2.60 ) for 1978-1987 .
The sex ratio ( male proportion ) was 0.483 ( 95% confidence interval : 0.457 to 0.508 ) in the first 10years after exposure .
Exposure to a mixture of PCBs and PCDFs affected stillbirth and sex ratio for a decade and a half after the exposure .
