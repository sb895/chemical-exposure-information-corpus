The aim of this research was to assess dermal and respiratory exposure of workers to imidacloprid during manual operations with ornamental plants previously treated in greenhouses or tunnels .
A total of 10 female workers , 5 in greenhouses and 5 in tunnels , were monitored for 3 or 5 consecutive days .
Actual skin contamination , excluding hands , was evaluated using nine filter paper pads placed directly on the skin .
To evaluate the efficacy of protective clothing in reducing occupational exposure we also placed four pads on top of the outer clothing .
Hand contamination was evaluated by washing with 95% ethanol .
Respiratory exposure was evaluated by personal air sampling .
Respiratory dose was calculated on the basis of a lung ventilation of 15 l/min .
Absorbed doses were calculated assuming a skin penetration of 10% and a respiratory retention of 100% .
Dislodgeable foliar residues ( DFRs ) were determined during the days of re-entry in order to determine the dermal transfer factor .
From the dependence of dermal exposure of hands from DFRs , a mean transfer factor was estimated to be 36.4 cm(2)/h .
Imidacloprid was determined by liquid chromatography with selective mass detection and electrospray interface in all matrices analysed .
Respiratory dose was 4.1+/-4.0 ( 0.1-14.3)% and 3.0+/-2.0 ( 0.6-6.9)% ( mean+/-SD ( range) ) of the total real dose during work in tunnels and greenhouses , respectively .
The estimated absorbed doses , 0.29+/-0.45 microg/kg ( 0.06-2.25 microg/kg ) body weight and 0.32+/-0.18 microg/kg ( 0.07-0.66 microg/kg ) body weight ( mean+/-SD ( range) ) in tunnels and in greenhouses , respectively , were less than the acceptable operator exposure level of 0.15 mg/kg body weight and than the acceptable daily intake of 0.05 mg/kg body weight .
The hands and exposed skin of all workers were found to be contaminated , indicating that greater precautions , such as daily changing of gloves and clothing , are necessary to reduce skin exposure .
