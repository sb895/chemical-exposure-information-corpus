Identifying and characterizing sources of exposure to phthalates and bisphenol A ( BPA ) have proved challenging due to the presence of multiple co-exposures resulting from a wide variety of home environments and lifestyles .
We hypothesized that the consistent lifestyle of an Old Order Mennonite ( OOM ) community would provide an ideal setting in which to characterize sources of exposure to BPA and phthalates .
We obtained urine samples from ten mid-term pregnant OOM women ( ages-21-39 ) to determine concentrations of 9 phthalate metabolites and BPA and collected a self-reported survey of participants ' household environment , product use , and lifestyle within a 48-h period prior to urine collection .
We compared their metabolite concentrations to pregnant women included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES 2007-2008 ) .
Although OOM participants reported some use of plastic and fragranced household products , concentrations of metabolites were lower and significantly less for BPA ( p=0.002 ) and phthalate metabolites MEHP ( p=0.0215 ) , MiBP ( p=0.0020 ) and MEP ( p=0.021 ) , when compared to NHANES pregnant women .
Levels of other phthalate metabolites were also lower in this population .
Our data suggest three practices that may contribute to these lower levels : ( 1 ) consuming mostly homegrown produce ( ingestion ) , ( 2 ) no cosmetics and limited use of personal care products , and ( 3 ) transportation primarily by sources other than automobiles .
