Lead , cadmium , mercury , and arsenic are common environmental pollutants in industrialized countries , but their combined impact on children's health is little known .
We studied their effects on two main targets , the renal and dopaminergic systems , in > 800 children during a cross-sectional European survey .
Control and exposed children were recruited from those living around historical nonferrous smelters in France , the Czech Republic , and Poland .
Children provided blood and urine samples for the determination of the metals and sensitive renal or neurologic biomarkers .
Serum concentrations of creatinine , cystatin C , and beta2-microglobulin were negatively correlated with blood lead levels ( PbB ) , suggesting an early renal hyperfiltration that averaged 7% in the upper quartile of PbB levels ( > 55 microg/L ; mean , 78.4 microg/L ) .
The urinary excretion of retinol-binding protein , Clara cell protein , and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase was associated mainly with cadmium levels in blood or urine and with urinary mercury .
All four metals influenced the dopaminergic markers serum prolactin and urinary homovanillic acid , with complex interactions brought to light .
Heavy metals polluting the environment can cause subtle effects on children's renal and dopaminergic systems without clear evidence of a threshold , which reinforces the need to control and regulate potential sources of contamination by heavy metals .
Key words : arsenic , biomarkers , cadmium , dopaminergic , heavy metals , interactions , lead , mercury , renal .
