One of the leading positions on the world's list of harmful substances is taken by cadmium , which is a heavy metal .
Cadmium ( Cd ) gets into the human body through either respiratory tract ( cigarette smoke ) or alimentary canal .
The aim of the study was to 1 ) determine whether the concentrations of cadmium in blood and urine of children from Katowice Murcki--one of the cleanest districts of the town - as well as its contents in the hair of the children exceeds acceptable values and 2 ) to analyse the effect of chosen environmental factors ( exposition to smoke , parents ' education ) on the amount of cadmium in these materials .
The study comprised 48 children at the age from 9-11 years from Katowice Murcki , attending the same primary school .
The findings were statistically analysed using Shapiro-Wilk and Wilcoxon test .
Concentration of cadmium in the blood was 0.479 microg/l , in urine 0.840 microg/g creatinine and the average concentration in the hair constituted 0.23 microg/g drymass .
Concentration of cadmium in the blood of 13 children ( 30.95% ) exceeded acceptable 0.5 microg/l value , while in 10 children ( 23.25% ) value in the urine was exceeded .
It was lug/g creatinine .
It has been shown that children who lived nearby motorway presented higher content of cadmium in the hair .
Environmental factors such as : location of the road and intensity of traffic influence the content of cadmium in the human body .
