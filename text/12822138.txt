BACKGROUND This pilot study was conducted to investigate biochemical effects of exposure to diesel engine exhaust at two mines .
For this purpose , heme biosynthesis , and PP association with DNA ( PP/DNA ) in lymphocytes of miners exposed to diesel exhaust were determined .
METHODS The pilot study was carried out at a black coal mine in Czech Republic , and at an oil-shale mine in Estonia .
The subjects were ten drivers from each mine , who were exposed to diesel exhaust ( underground workers ) .
Control groups consisted of ten maintenance workers from each mine ( surface workers ) .
The content of 1-nitropyrene ( NP ) in respirable dust was measured using GC-MS .
The levels of PP , PP/DNA , heme , and activity of ferrochelatase ( FC ) were determined by spectrophotometry .
RESULTS The exposure to diesel exhaust evaluated as the level of NP associated to particulate matter in air .
NP level was significantly higher in oil-shale mine compared with coal mine .
The values of PP and PP/DNA in lymphocytes appeared to be significantly increased only in miners in the oil-shale mine .
There was no difference in the levels of PP and PP/DNA and FC activity between surface workers and miners at the coal mine .
The level of heme in lymphocytes of coal mine miners was significantly higher than in miners of the oil-shale mine .
The activity of FC was significantly lower in underground workers compared to surface workers at this mine .
High level of NP was accompanied by an increase of alterations in cells porphyrin metabolism in lymphocytes of miners .
CONCLUSIONS Alterations of porphyrin and heme metabolism in peripheral lymphocytes may serve as biomarker in assessment of exposure to diesel exhaust effects .
