It has frequently been claimed that cycling in heavy traffic is unhealthy , more so than driving a car .
To test this hypothesis , teams of two cyclists and two car drivers in two cars were equipped with personal air samplers while driving for 4 h on 2 different days in the morning traffic of Copenhagen .
The air sample charcoal tubes were analysed for their benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene and xylene ( BTEX ) content and the air filters for particles ( total dust ) .
The concentrations of particles and BTEX in the cabin of the cars were 2-4 times greater than in the cyclists ' breathing zone , the greatest difference being for BTEX .
Therefore , even after taking the increased respiration rate of cyclists into consideration , car drivers seem to be more exposed to airborne pollution than cyclists .
