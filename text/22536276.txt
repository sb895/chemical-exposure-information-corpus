Heavy metals , particularly cadmium , lead , and arsenic , constitute a significant potential threat to human health .
This study was conducted to determine the levels of cadmium , lead , and arsenic in nail samples from farmers at Muda Agricultural Development Authority ( MADA ) , Kedah , Malaysia , and evaluate factors that can contribute to their accumulations .
A total of 116 farmers participated in this study .
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) was used to analyze concentration of heavy metals in the nail samples and questionnaires were given to participants to get demographic , health status , and their agricultural activities data .
In this paper , the level of heavy metals was within the normal range and varies according to demographic factors .
We found that there were significant correlations between working period with level of lead and arsenic ( r=0.315 and r=0.242 , resp. , P<0.01 ) and age with lead level ( r=0.175 , P<0.05 ) .
Our findings suggested that agricultural activities could contribute to the accumulation of heavy metals in farmers .
Hence , the control of environmental levels of and human exposure to these metals to prevent adverse health effects is still an important public health issue .
