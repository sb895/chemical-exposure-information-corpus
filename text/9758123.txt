BACKGROUND The aetiology of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) remains poorly understood .
Dental amalgams containing mercury have recently been suggested as a possible risk factor for MS. METHODS In a case-control study conducted between 1991 and 1994 , we interviewed a total of 143 MS patients and 128 controls , to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics and the number of dental amalgams and the time since installation based on dentists ' records .
RESULTS Neither the number nor the duration of exposure to amalgams supported an increased risk of MS. After adjustment for age , sex , smoking , and education those who had more than 15 fillings had an odds ratio ( OR ) of 2.57 ( 95% CI : 0.78-8.54 ) compared to those who had none ; for individuals whose first amalgam was inserted more than 15 years prior to the study , we found an OR of 1.34 ( 95% CI : 0.38-4.72 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Although a suggestive elevated risk was found for those individuals with a large number of dental amalgams , and for a long period of time , the difference between cases and controls was not statistically significant .
