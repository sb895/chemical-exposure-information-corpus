The objective of this study was to assess individual variation in inorganic arsenic methylation capability and the association between selenium levels in urine and blood , and inorganic arsenic methylation capability among residents of the Lanyang Basin who drank groundwater and were exposed to high concentrations of inorganic arsenic .
According to the arsenic concentration of their drinking water , they were equally and randomly classified into four groups of 252 persons .
It turned out that the higher the concentration of arsenic in well water was and thus the cumulative arsenic exposure , the higher the total inorganic arsenic metabolites in urine ( total As(i) ) and the overall inorganic and organic arsenic in urine ( overall As(i+o) ) were .
The percentage of inorganic arsenic significantly decreased and the DMA percentage significantly increased as the concentration of urinary selenium and serum alpha-tocopherol increased .
It appeared that urinary selenium levels increased the metabolism by methylation of arsenic , a finding that requires further investigation .
