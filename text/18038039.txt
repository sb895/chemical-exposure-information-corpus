Recent evidence suggests that fluoride ( F ) and arsenic ( As ) may adversely affect intelligence quotient ( IQ ) scores .
We explore the association between exposure to F and As in drinking water and intelligence in children .
Three rural communities in Mexico with contrasting levels of F and As in drinking water were studied : Moctezuma ( F 0.8+/-1.4 mg/L ; As 5.8+/-1.3 microg/L ) ; Salitral ( F 5.3+/-0.9 mg/L ; As 169+/-0.9 microg/L ) and 5 de Febrero ( F 9.4+/-0.9 mg/L ; As 194+/-1.3 microg/L ) .
The final study sample consisted of 132 children from 6 to 10 years old .
After controlling for confounders , an inverse association was observed between F in urine and Performance , Verbal , and Full IQ scores ( beta values = -13 , -15.6 , -16.9 , respectively ) .
Similar results were observed for F in drinking water ( beta values = -6.7 , -11.2 , -10.2 , respectively ) and As in drinking water ( beta values= -4.30 , -6.40 , -6.15 , respectively ) .
The p-values for all cases were < 0.001 .
A significant association was observed between As in urine and Full IQ scores ( beta = -5.72 , p = 0.003 ) .
These data suggest that children exposed to either F or As have increased risks of reduced IQ scores .
