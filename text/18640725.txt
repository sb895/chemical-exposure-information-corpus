Phthalates are developmental and reproductive toxicants for the fetus in pregnant rodents , and the ability of phthalates to penetrate the placenta have been reported .
The aims of this study were to evaluate the association between maternal urine excretion , the exposure of fetus to phthalates in amniotic fluid , and the health of newborns .
Amniotic fluid and urine samples from pregnant women were collected to measure five phthalate monoesters using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS-MS ) and the newborns ' birth weight , gestational age , and anogenital distance ( AGD ) were collected .
The median levels of three phthalate monoesters in urine and amniotic fluid were 78.4 and 85.2 ng/mL monobutyl phthalate ( MBP ) ; 24.9 and 22.8 ng/mL mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( MEHP ) ; 19.8 and Not Detected monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) .
We found a significant positive correlation only between creatinine adjusted urinary MBP and amniotic fluid MBP ( R(2)=0.156 , p<0.05 ) in all infants and , only in female infants , a significantly negative correlation between amniotic fluid MBP , AGD ( R=-0.31 , p<0.06 ) , and the anogenital index adjusted by birth weight ( AGI-W ) ( R=-0.32 , p<0.05 ) .
Although the influence of prenatal di-n-butyl phthalate ( DBP ) exposure on the endocrinology and physiology of the fetus is still a puzzle , our data clearly show that in utero exposure to phthalates in general has anti-androgenic effects on the fetus .
