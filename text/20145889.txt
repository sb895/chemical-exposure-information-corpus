Mercury is a persistent heavy metal that has been associated with damage to the central nervous system , including hearing and speech impairment , visual constriction and loss of muscle control .
In aquatic environments mercury may be methylated to its most toxic form , methyl-mercury .
In 1990 concerns were raised over mercury contamination in the vicinity of a mercury processing plant in KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa .
Mercury waste was reported to have been discharged into the Mngceweni River , situated in close proximity to the plant .
The Mngceweni River joins the uMgeni River , which in turn flows into the Inanda Dam , along the banks of which several villages are located .
This study evaluated the mercury levels in river and dam sediments , fish from the Inanda Dam and hair samples collected from residents of three villages along the banks of the Inanda Dam .
The study results showed that 50% of the fish samples and 17% of hair samples collected from villagers had mercury concentrations that exceeded guideline levels of the World Health Organization .
Mercury concentrations in 62% of the river sediment samples collected in close proximity to the former mercury processing plant exceeded the level at which remedial action is required according to legislation in the Netherlands .
These preliminary findings give reasons for concern and should be used as a baseline for further investigations .
