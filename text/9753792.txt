The groundwater in seven districts of West Bengal , India , covering an area of 37,000 km2 with a population of 34 million , has been contaminated with arsenic .
In 830 villages/wards more than 1.5 million people , out of the total population , drink the arsenic-contaminated water .
Safe water from a source having < 0.002 mg 1(-1) arsenic has been supplied for 2 years to five affected families comprising 17 members ( eight of them with arsenical skin-lesions ) of different age groups for impact assessment study in terms of loss of arsenic through urine , hair and nail .
The study indicates random observable fluctuations of arsenic concentration in urine among members on different scheduled sampling days with a declining trend , particularly during the first 6 months .
Furthermore , the investigation showed that despite having safe water for drinking and cooking , the study group could not avoid an intake of arsenic , time and again , through edible herbs grown in contaminated water , food materials contaminated through washing , and the occasional drinking of contaminated water .
After minimizing the level of contamination , a noteworthy declining trend after 8 months was observed in urine , hair and nails in all the cases , but not to that level observed in a normal population , due to prevailing elevated background level of arsenic in the area .
The eight members , who had already developed skin lesions , are far from recovering completely , indicating a long-lasting damage .
Statistical interpretation of the data are considered .
