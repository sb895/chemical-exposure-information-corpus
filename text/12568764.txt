Trail , British Columbia has been the site of an active lead-zinc smelter for approximately 95 years .
Since 1989 , the community has been monitoring blood lead levels in children , studying exposure pathways and conducting comprehensive education and case management programs .
From 1989 through 1996 , mean blood lead levels of pre-school children declined at an average rate of 0.6 microg/dl per year .
From 1996 to 1999 , mean blood lead levels fell at an average rate of 1.8 microg/dl per year , from 11.5 in 1996 to 5.9 in 1999 .
The recent rapid decline appears to be mainly attributable to the start-up of a new lead smelter using modern flash-smelting technology in May of 1997 .
In 1998 , the annual arithmetic mean air lead level in Trail was 0.28 microg/m(3) , compared with 1.1 microg/m(3) in 1996 .
Reductions of approximately 50% were observed in lead loadings and concentrations in outdoor dustfall , street dust and indoor dustfall after smelter emissions were reduced .
Slight reductions ( statistically insignificant ) have been observed in carpet dust and soil lead concentrations .
During the summer of 2001 , the smelting and refining operations at Trail were shut down completely for 3 months .
During this period , average air lead levels in Trail dropped to 0.03 microg/m(3) .
The average blood lead level in Trail pre-school children at the end of the shutdown was 4.7 microg/dl .
These results challenge prevailing theories about the relative importance of various environmental lead sources .
For example , the US EPA Integrated Biokinetic Uptake Model for Lead ( IEUBK ) , with its emphasis on soil concentrations , would not have predicted the dramatic decline in children's blood lead levels seen in Trail following the reductions in air lead levels .
The Trail experience suggests that increased attention should be paid to the importance of active sources of highly bioavailable and mobile lead bearing dusts .
