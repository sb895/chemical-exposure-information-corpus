New York City Firefighters ( FDNY-FFs ) were exposed to particulate matter and combustion/pyrolysis products during and after the World Trade Center ( WTC ) collapse .
Ten months after the collapse , induced sputum ( IS ) samples were obtained from 39 highly exposed FDNY-FFs ( caught in the dust cloud during the collapse on 11 September 2001 ) and compared to controls to determine whether a unique pattern of inflammation and particulate matter deposition , compatible with WTC dust , was present .
Control subjects were 12 Tel-Aviv , Israel , firefighters ( TA-FFs ) and 8 Israeli healthcare workers who were not exposed to WTC dust .
All controls volunteered for this study , had never smoked , and did not have respiratory illness .
IS was processed by conventional methods .
Retrieved cells were differentially counted , and metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , particle size distribution ( PSD ) , and mineral composition were measured .
Differential cell counts of FDNY-FF IS differed from those of health care worker controls ( p < 0.05 ) but not from those of TA-FFs .
Percentages of neutrophils and eosinophils increased with greater intensity of WTC exposure ( < 10 workdays or greater than or equal to 10 workdays ; neutrophils p = 0.046 ; eosinophils p = 0.038 ) .
MMP-9 levels positively correlated to neutrophil counts ( p = 0.002 ; r = 0.449 ) .
Particles were larger and more irregularly shaped in FDNY-FFs ( 1-50 microm ; zinc , mercury , gold , tin , silver ) than in TA-FFs ( 1-10 microm ; silica , clays ) .
PSD was similar to that of WTC dust samples .
In conclusion , IS from highly exposed FDNY-FFs demonstrated inflammation , PSD , and particle composition that was different from nonexposed controls and consistent with WTC dust exposure .
