Quantifying dermal exposure to pesticides in farming systems in developing countries is of special interest for the estimation of potential health risks , especially when there is a lack of occupational hygiene regulations .
In this paper we present the results of a dermal exposure assessment for the potato farming system in the highlands of Colombia , where farmers apply pesticides with hand pressure sprayers without any personal protective equipment .
The fractioning of the pesticide , in terms of potential and actual dermal exposure , was determined via the whole-body dosimetry methodology , using the tracer uranine as pesticide surrogate , and luminescence spectrometry as analytical method .
We assessed the three activities involved in pesticide management : preparation , application , and cleaning ; analyzed three types of nozzles : one with a standard discharge and two modified by farmers to increase the discharge ; and derived the protection factor given by work clothing .
Our results suggest that to reduce the health risk , three aspects have to be considered : ( i ) avoiding the modification of nozzles , which affects the droplet size spectrum and increases the level of dermal exposure ; ( ii ) using adequate work clothing made of thick fabrics , especially on the upper body parts ; and ( iii ) cleaning properly the tank sprayer before the application activity .
