Total mercury and methylmercury concentrations were measured in sediments and marine organisms from the Taranto Gulf to understand their distribution and partitioning .
Sediment concentrations ranged from 0.036 to 7.730 mg/kg ( mean : 2.777 mg/kg d.w. ) and from 1 to 40 \u03bcg/kg ( mean : 11 \u03bcg/kg d.w. ) for total mercury ( THg ) and methylmercury ( Me-Hg ) , respectively .
In mollusks THg ranged from n.d. to 1870 \u03bcg/kg d.w. while in fish from 324 to 1740 \u03bcg/kg d.w .
Me-Hg concentrations in fish ranged from 190 to 1040 \u03bcg/kg d.w. and from n.d. to 1321 \u03bcg/kg d.w. in mollusks .
THg exceeded the maximum level fixed by the European Commission ( 0.5 mg/kg w.w. ) only in gastropod Hexaplex t .
The calculated weekly intake was in many cases over the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake established by EFSA for all edible species .
These results seem to indicate that dietary consumption of this seafood implicates an appreciable risk for human health .
