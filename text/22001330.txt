In Cologne , Germany , increased concentrations of perfluorinated compounds ( PFC ) have been observed in two private wells used for drinking water purposes .
Both wells are located in the vicinity of a fire training area .
Use of well water as a source of drinking water was prohibited by the Public Health Department of the City of Cologne .
A human biomonitoring ( HBM ) survey was performed among all persons , who consumed water from these private wells ( N=10 ) .
PFC concentrations in water of the private wells and in blood samples were analysed by tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization ( LC-ESI-MS/MS ) .
Repeated water analyses ( seven measurements between December 2009 and November 2010 ) indicated a decrease of PFOS from 8.35 to 1.60 \u03bcg/l , ( PFHxS : 2.36-0.15 \u03bcg/l ; PFOA : 0.16-0.03 \u03bcg/l ) in one private well .
Although situated close together , PFC-concentrations in the other private well were significantly lower .
PFOS-concentrations in blood samples of private well water consumers ranged from 4.8 to 295 \u03bcg/l ( PFHxS : 12.1-205 \u03bcg/l ; PFOA : 4.0-18 \u03bcg/l ) .
Although no data on the formulation of the firefighting foams applied on the fire training area is available , firefighting foams are supposed to be the most likely source of contamination .
These findings give reason to track systematically the application of PFC-containing firefighting foams in order to identify contaminations of surface , ground and drinking waters .
