Work safety and hygiene is a set of basic measures to protect workers from the negative effects of manufacturing processes .
So far , numerous procedures for assessment of occupational health risk have been described .
We measured the concentrations of some elements in teeth and body fluids of employees working in three different industries with an established production profile : Zak\u0142ady Naprawcze Taboru Kolejowego ( repairs of rail vehicles ) , Philips Lighting Poland ( production of lighting systems ) and Metalplast ( build ing furbishing factory ) .
Different technologies were in place at each of these plants .
Basing on laboratory analyses , the risk of exposure to chemical substances was evaluated .
The study material included 100 extracted teeth , as well as body fluid samples ( saliva , urine and blood ) collected during routine health checks .
Whenever possible , concentrations of the following elements were measured : calcium , magnesium , fluorine , phosphorus in the form of phosphates , potassium , sodium , iron , zinc , copper , cadmium , and lead .
Metal elements were measured spectrophotometrically ( ASA ) , fluorine with an ion-selective electrode , and phosphates with a colorimetric method .
We found that concentrations of the elements in teeth and body fluids differed depending on the industry .
For teeth , statistically significant differences applied to magnesium , phosphates , zinc , sodium , and potassium .
In body fluids , statistically significant differences were found for calcium ( blood and urine ) , magnesium ( blood , urine and saliva ) , zinc ( blood , urine and saliva ) , iron , lead and copper ( urine ) .
In conclusion , our findings may be helpful for monitoring safety at work in industrial plants .
