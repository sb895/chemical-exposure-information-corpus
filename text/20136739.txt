Bisphenol A ( BPA ) is an endocrine disrupting chemical that is found in human urine throughout industrial societies around the globe .
Consumer exposure pathways to BPA include packaged food , household dust , air , and dental fillings .
To date , information on the relative contribution of the different pathways to total consumer exposure is lacking , but is key for managing substance-associated risks .
We investigated the relative contributions of the pathways known to be most relevant for nine different consumer groups .
Our results suggest that the most important pathways for infants and children are the use of polycarbonate ( PC ) baby bottles and for adults and teenagers the consumption of canned food .
Dental surgery can also considerably contribute over a short time directly after the surgery .
For infants fed with PC baby bottles with mean dose rates of 0.8 microg/kg(bw)/d the highest exposure dose rate was calculated .
This dose rate is far below the tolerable daily intake of 50 microg/kg(bw)/d .
However , it is of the same order of magnitude as recently reported concentrations that caused low-dose health effects in rodents .
We find a pattern of falling exposure levels with rising age that is supported by urinary concentrations of BPA available for selected consumer groups .
Similarly , the exposure levels we predict are confirmed by the levels reported in these studies .
