The influence of dental amalgam fillings and fish eating frequency on the urinary mercury ( Hg ) level was evaluated in 1642 children ( ages : 3-18 ) living in Tokyo .
Geometric mean of the urinary Hg level was 1.9 microgram Hg/l and 1.9 micrograms Hg/g creatinine ( Cr ) for boys and 2.1 micrograms Hg/l and 2.0 micrograms Hg/g Cr for girls .
Multiple regression analysis was conducted using : ( 1 ) urinary Cr concentration ( only in the case of urinary Hg expressed as microgram Hg/l ) ; ( 2 ) age ; ( 3 ) gender ; ( 4 ) number of dental amalgam fillings ; and ( 5 ) fish eating frequency as independent variables .
As a result , all the variables examined were significant and the explanatory powers ( square of multiple correlation coefficient ) of these variables were 17 or 7% for urinary Hg expressed as microgram Hg/l or microgram Hg/g Cr , respectively .
Number of dental amalgam fillings or fish eating frequency explained only up to 1.5% of the total variance of urinary Hg .
Contribution of Cr concentration , age and gender to urinary Hg level is also discussed .
