During the first randomized intervention trial ( RESPIRE : Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects ) in air pollution epidemiology , we pioneered application of passive carbon monoxide ( CO ) diffusion tubes to measure long-term personal exposures to woodsmoke .
Here we report on the protocols and validations of the method , trends in personal exposure for mothers and their young children , and the efficacy of the introduced improved chimney stove in reducing personal exposures and kitchen concentrations .
Passive diffusion tubes originally developed for industrial hygiene applications were deployed on a quarterly basis to measure 48-hour integrated personal carbon monoxide exposures among 515 children 0-18 months of age and 532 mothers aged 15-55 years and area samples in a subsample of 77 kitchens , in households randomized into control and intervention groups .
Instrument comparisons among types of passive diffusion tubes and against a continuous electrochemical CO monitor indicated that tubes responded nonlinearly to CO , and regression calibration was used to reduce this bias .
Before stove introduction , the baseline arithmetic ( geometric ) mean 48-h child ( n=270 ) , mother ( n=529 ) and kitchen ( n=65 ) levels were , respectively , 3.4 ( 2.8 ) , 3.4 ( 2.8 ) and 10.2 ( 8.4 ) p.p.m .
The between-group analysis of the 3355 post-baseline measurements found CO levels to be significantly lower among the intervention group during the trial period : kitchen levels : -90% ; mothers : -61% ; and children : -52% in geometric means .
No significant deterioration in stove effect was observed over the 18 months of surveillance .
The reliability of these findings is strengthened by the large sample size made feasible by these unobtrusive and inexpensive tubes , measurement error reduction through instrument calibration , and a randomized , longitudinal study design .
These results from the first randomized trial of improved household energy technology in a developing country and demonstrate that a simple chimney stove can substantially reduce chronic exposures to harmful indoor air pollutants among women and infants .
