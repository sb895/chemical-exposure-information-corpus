In recent years , and based on the importance of fish as a part of a healthy diet , there has been a notable promotion of fish consumption .
However , the balance between health benefits and risks , due to the intake of chemical contaminants , is not well characterized .
In the present study , edible samples of 14 marine species were analyzed for the concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids , as well as a number of metals and organic pollutants .
Daily intakes were specifically determined for a standard adult of 70kg , and compared with the tolerable/admissible intakes of the pollutants , if available .
Salmon , mackerel , and red mullet were the species showing the highest content of omega-3 fatty acids .
The daily intakes of cadmium , lead , and mercury through fish consumption were 1.1 , 2.0 , and 9.9microg , respectively .
Dioxins and furans plus dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) intake was 38.0pg WHO-TEQ/day , whereas those of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , polychlorinated diphenyl ethers ( PCDEs ) , polychlorinated naphthalenes ( PCNs ) and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) were 20.8 , 39.4 , 1.53 , and 1.50ng/day , respectively .
In turn , the total intake of 16 analyzed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) was 268ng/day .
The monthly fish consumption limits for human health endpoints based on the intake of these chemical contaminants were calculated for a 70 years exposure .
In general terms , most marine species here analyzed should not mean adverse health effects for the consumers .
However , the type of fish , the frequency of consumption , and the meal size are essential issues for the balance of the health benefits and risks of regular fish consumption .
