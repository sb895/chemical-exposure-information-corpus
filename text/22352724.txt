This study assesses the arsenic ( As ) accumulation in different varieties of rice grain , that people in rural Bengal mostly prefer for daily consumption , to estimate the potential risk of dietary As exposure through rice intake .
The rice samples have been classified according to their average length ( L ) and L to breadth ( B ) ratio into four categories , such as short-bold ( SB ) , medium-slender ( MS ) , long-slender ( LS ) , and extra-long slender ( ELS ) .
The brown colored rice samples fall into the SB , MS , or LS categories ; while all Indian Basmati ( white colored ) are classified as ELS .
The study indicates that the average accumulation of As in rice grain increases with a decrease of grain size ( ELS : 0.04 ; LS : 0.10 ; MS : 0.16 ; and SB : 0.33 mg kg(-1) ) , however people living in the rural villages mostly prefer brown colored SB type of rice because of its lower cost .
For the participants consuming SB type of brown rice , the total daily intake of inorganic As ( TDI-iAs ) in 29% of the cases exceeds the previous WHO recommended provisional tolerable daily intake value ( 2.1 \u03bcg day(-1) kg(-1) BW ) , and in more than 90% of cases , the As content in the drinking water equivalent to the inorganic As intake from rice consumption ( C(W,eqv) ) exceeds the WHO drinking water guideline of 10 \u03bcg L(-1) .
This study further demonstrates that participants in age groups 18-30 and 51-65 yrs are the most vulnerable to the potential health threat of dietary As exposure compared to participants of age group 31-50 yrs , because of higher amounts of brown rice consumption patterns and lower BMI .
