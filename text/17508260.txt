To estimate exposure to cadmium ( Cd ) and lead ( Pb ) through cigarette smoking , the concentrations of both metals in the blood or/and urine of smokers ( 20 cigarettes or more per day for 10 years or longer ) and their non-smoking counterparts inhabiting an environmentally unpolluted area ( Bialystok , Poland ) were evaluated , as well as Cd and Pb contents in the cigarette brands ( produced in Poland ) smoked by the participants , including intact cigarettes , pre-smoking ( tobacco , paper and filter ) and post-smoking ( butt , ash and smoke ) cigarette components .
Blood and urinary Cd concentrations in the smokers have been already reported by us to be 2-4 times higher than in the non-smokers ( Galazyn-Sidorczuk et al .
Polish Journal of Environmental Studies , 13 ( Suppl.1):91-95 , 2004 ) .
All the other measurements are the subject of the present paper .
Pb concentration in the blood of the cigarette smokers ( 52.12 +/- 15.51 microg l(-1) ) was higher by 29% than in the non-smokers ( 40.42 +/- 11.19 microg l(-1) ) .
The mean Cd and Pb contents in the cigarettes were 0.6801 +/- 0.1765 and 0.6853 +/- 0.0746 microg per cigarette , respectively .
Under cigarette burning , performed using a machine for self-acting burning , on average 33% of Cd and 11% of Pb present in the whole cigarette was released into the smoke .
For Cd , unlike Pb , there was a high positive correlation between the metal content in cigarettes and tobacco and its release into the smoke .
Moreover , the subjects smoking cigarettes containing the highest Cd amount had higher blood Cd concentration than smokers of other cigarette brands .
The results give clear evidence that in the case of inhabitants of areas unpolluted with Cd and Pb habitual cigarette smoking , due to tobacco contamination , creates a serious source of chronic exposure to these metals , especially to Cd .
