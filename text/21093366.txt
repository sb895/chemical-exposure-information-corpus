Lead , cadmium and mercury were measured in placental tissue , umbilical cord and maternal blood samples of 1578 women who delivered at the Al-Kharj King Khalid Hospital between 2005 and 2006 .
The aim of this study was to evaluate the status of heavy metal exposure in mothers and their newborns and to identify predictors of maternal exposure .
Lead was detected in all cord and maternal blood and in 96% of placental tissues .
Only in 0.89% and 0.83% of cord and maternal blood samples were the levels of lead above the CDC threshold limit of 10 \u03bcg/dl .
Maternal blood lead was also higher ( 2.3% ) than the German Reference value in women of 7 \u03bcg/dl .
Approximately 9.3% of women had a placental lead above the 95th percentile in the range of 0.83-78 \u03bcg/g dry wt. , a level of possible developmental toxicity .
Cadmium was detected in 94.8% and 97.9% of cord and maternal blood samples respectively , though only five newborns had a cadmium level above the OSHA threshold limit of 5 \u03bcg/l .
Comparing our results to the newly revised German Reference value for nonsmokers , 48.6% of mothers had blood cadmium levels >1.0 \u03bcg/l .
We found as well that 25% of women had placental cadmium in the >75th percentile , in the range of 0.048-4.36 \u03bcg/g dry wt. , which is likely to affect fetal growth and development .
Of the maternal and cord blood samples , 11.2% and 13% , respectively , had mercury levels >5.8 \u03bcg/l , which is the EPA reference dose .
Nearly 49% of women had mercury levels >2.0 \u03bcg/l , the German Reference value for those who consume fish \u22643 times a month .
Around 50% of the mothers had placental mercury in the range of 0.031-13.0 \u03bcg/g dry wt .
Regression analyses indicated that the levels of metals in the blood and placenta were influenced by several factors .
This study provides informative baseline biomonitoring data and reveals a substantial exposure to heavy metals in non-occupationally exposed Saudi mothers and their newborns that might jeopardize the health of both .
Additional research is also urgently needed to explore factors such as environment , diet , lifestyle and/or cultural habits contributing to maternal and fetal exposures .
Preventive measures to eliminate or minimize the unnecessary risk of fetus exposure to heavy metals or other pollutants during pregnancy should be initiated once these factors are identified .
