Arsenic ( As ) exposure has been associated with alterations in the immune system , studies in experimental models and adults have shown that these effects involve macrophage function ; however , limited information is available on what type of effects could be induced in children .
The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of As exposure , through the association of inorganic As ( iAs ) and its metabolites [ monomethylated arsenic ( MMA ) and dimethylated arsenic ( DMA) ] with basal levels of nitric oxide ( NO(-) ) and superoxide anion ( O(2)(-) ) , in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and monocytes , and NO(-) and O(2)(-) produced by activated monocytes .
Hence , a cross-sectional study was conducted in 87 children ( 6-10 years old ) who had been environmentally exposed to As through drinking water .
Levels of urinary As species ( iAs , MMA and DMA ) were determined by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry , total As ( tAs ) represents the sum of iAs and its species ; tAs urine levels ranged from 12.3 to 1411 microg/g creatinine .
Using multiple linear regression models , iAs presented a positive and statistical association with basal NO(-) in PBMC ( beta=0.0048 , p=0.049 ) and monocytes ( beta=0.0044 , p=0.044 ) , while basal O(2)(-) had a significant positive association with DMA ( beta=0.0025 , p=0.046 ) .
In activated monocytes , O(2)(-) showed a statistical and positive association with iAs ( beta=0.0108 , p=0.023 ) , MMA ( beta=0.0066 , p=0.022 ) , DMA ( beta=0.0018 , p=0.015 ) , and tAs ( beta=0.0013 , p=0.015 ) .
We conclude that As exposure in the studied children was positively associated with basal levels of NO(-) and O(2)(-) in PBMC and monocytes , suggesting that As induces oxidative stress in circulating blood cells .
Additionally , this study showed a positive association of O(2)(-) production with iAs and its metabolites in stimulated monocytes , supporting previous data that suggests that these cells , and particularly the O(2)(-) activation pathway , are relevant targets for As toxicity .
