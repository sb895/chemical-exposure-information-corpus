In this study , we recruited 49 subjects from one village close to an electronic waste ( e-waste ) site ( exposed group ) and another located 50 km away from the e-waste site ( control group ) .
We found that serum levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( median PBDEs , 382 ng/g lipid weight ; range , 77-8452 ng/g lipid weight ) and thyroid-stimulating hormone ( median TSH , 1.79 microIU/mL ; range , 0.38-9.03 microIU/mL ) and frequencies of micro-nucleated binucleated cells ( MNed BNC ; median , 5% per hundred ; range , 0-96% per hundred ) were significantly higher in the exposed group than in the control group ( 158 ng/g , range of 18-436 ng/g , and p < 0.05 ; 1.15 microIU/mL , range of 0.48-2.09 , and p < 0.01 ; and 0% per hundred , range of 0-5% per hundred , and p < 0.01 , respectively ) .
A history of working with e-waste was significantly associated with increased MNed BNC frequencies ( odds ratio ( OR ) , 38.85 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = 1-1358.71 , p = 0.044 ) , independent of years of local residence , a perceived risk factor .
However , there was no association between PBDEs exposure and oxidative DNA damage .
Therefore , the exposure to PBDEs at the e-waste site may have an effect on the levels of TSH and genetoxic damage among these workers , but this needs to be validated in large studies .
