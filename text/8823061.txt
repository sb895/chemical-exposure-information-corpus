The associations between toenail levels of five trace elements and breast cancer risk were studied among a cohort of 62,641 US women who provided toenail clippings and were free from diagnosed breast cancer in 1982 .
Among 433 cases of breast cancer identified during 4 years of follow-up and their matched controls , the odds ratios comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles and adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors were as follows : for arsenic , 1.12 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 0.66-1.91 ) ; for copper , 0.91 ( 95% CI 0.59-1.42 ) ; for chromium , 0.96 ( 95% CI 0.61-1.52 ) ; for iron , 0.89 ( 95% CI 0.56-1.40 ) ; and for zinc , 1.09 ( 95% CI 0.70-1.70 ) .
Among postmenopausal women , a marginally significant positive association was observed between toenail chromium levels and breast cancer risk ( odds ratio = 1.71 , 95% CI 0.87-3.35 ) ( p for trend = 0.07 ) .
However , the association between chromium and breast cancer risk was inverse among premenopausal women .
Although data on the validity of toenail levels of certain of these elements are limited , these results do not provide evidence for an important effect of arsenic , copper , chromium , iron , or zinc on breast cancer risk .
