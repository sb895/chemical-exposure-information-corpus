Breast milk might be a source of potentially toxic metals such as cadmium ( Cd ) .
The purpose of the present study is to provide data pertaining to the influence of maternal lifestyles on Cd concentrations in breast milk in the Austrian setting .
Breast milk was obtained from 124 Austrian women .
Each participant provided 10 ml of milk .
A second group of eight mothers were recruited to investigate changes in their milk cadmium levels at 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 and 9 weeks post partum .
The study participants filled a questionnaire concerning nutrition , supplementation , and smoking habits .
The samples were analyzed using GF-Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer ( AAS ) .
The mean Cd content in breast milk was among the lowest in Europe ( 0.086 +/- 0.085 microg/l , 95% CI : 0.07-0.10 ; n = 124 ) .
Increased Cd levels in breast milk were found to be significantly associated with frequent cereal consumption and smoking .
Smokers had a two-fold higher concentration than did non-smokers ( 0.15 versus 0.07 microg/l ; P = 0.000 ) .
In contrast , low Cd levels in breast milk were associated with the intake of supplements containing trace elements or vitamins and trace elements ( P < 0.05 ) .
This protective effect of supplements on Cd levels was only observed in non-smokers .
The Cd levels registered in the present investigation were far below critical levels .
We conclude that the current maternal Cd levels in Austria signify no risk for the breastfed infant of a healthy mother .
Further research will have to focus on the specific effects of supplementation and smoking on Cd concentrations .
