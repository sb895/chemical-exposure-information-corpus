We modified our prior age-dependent half-life model to characterize the range of child ( ages 0-7 ) body burdens associated with dietary and environmental exposure to polychlorodibenzodioxins and furans ( PCDD/Fs ) .
Several exposure scenarios were evaluated .
Infants were assumed to be either breast-fed or formula-fed from birth to 6 months of age .
They then received intakes of PCDD/Fs through age 7 from foods based on weighted means estimates [ JECFA , 2001 .

The updated body fat mass data nearly halved the predicted peak body burden for breast-feeding and lowered the time-weighted average ( TWA ) body burdens from ages 0-7 by 30-40% for breast-fed and formula-fed infants .
Combined use of the updated breast milk PCDD/F concentration and body fat mass data increased the contribution of breast-feeding but reduced TWA body burdens from diet and soil .
We conclude that further refinements are needed , but reliance on these better data sets for body fat mass and breast milk PCDD/F concentration significantly improves the model's ability to accurately predict body burdens during early childhood .
