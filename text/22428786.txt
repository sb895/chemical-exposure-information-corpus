Phthalates are a group of chemicals present in numerous consumer products .
They have anti-androgenic properties in experimental studies and are suspected to be involved in human male reproductive health problems .
A few studies have shown associations between phthalate exposure and changes in pubertal timing among girls , although controversies exist .
We determined the concentration of 12 phthalate metabolites in first morning urine samples from 725 healthy Danish girls ( aged 5.6-19.1 years ) in relation to age , pubertal development ( breast and pubic hair stage ) and reproductive hormone levels ( luteinizing hormone , oestradiol and testosterone ) .
Furthermore , urinary phthalates were determined in 25 girls with precocious puberty ( PP ) .
In general , the youngest girls with less advanced pubertal development had the highest first morning urinary concentration of the monobutyl phthalate isoforms ( \u2211MBP((i+n)) ) , monobenzyl phthalate ( MBzP ) , metabolites of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( \u2211DEHPm ) and of di-iso-nonyl phthalate ( \u2211DINPm ) .
After stratification of the urinary phthalate excretion into quartiles , we found that the age at pubarche was increasing with increasing phthalate metabolite quartiles ( except for MEP ) .
This trend was statistically significant when all phthalate metabolites ( except MEP ) were summarized and expressed as quartiles .
No association between phthalates and breast development was observed .
In addition , there were no differences in urinary phthalate metabolite levels between girls with PP and controls .
We demonstrated that delayed pubarche , but not thelarche , was associated with high phthalate excretion in urine samples from 725 healthy school girls , which may suggest anti-androgenic actions of phthalates in our study group of girls .
