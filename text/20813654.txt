BACKGROUND The long-term effects of arsenic exposure from drinking water at levels < 300 microg/L and the risk of diabetes mellitus remains a controversial topic .
METHOD We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using baseline data from 11,319 participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study in Araihazar , Bangladesh , to evaluate the associations of well water arsenic and total urinary arsenic concentration and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and glucosuria .
We also assessed the concentrations of well water arsenic , total urinary arsenic , and urinary arsenic metabolites in relation to blood glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) levels in subsets of the study population .
RESULTS More than 90% of the cohort members were exposed to drinking water with arsenic concentration < 300 microg/L .
We found no association between arsenic exposure and the prevalence of diabetes .
The adjusted odds ratios for diabetes were 1.00 ( referent ) , 1.35 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.90-2.02 ] , 1.24 ( 0.82-1.87 ) , 0.96 ( 0.62-1.49 ) , and 1.11 ( 0.73-1.69 ) in relation to quintiles of time-weighted water arsenic concentrations of 0.1-8 , 8-41 , 41-91 , 92-176 , and > or = 177 microg/L , respectively , and 1.00 ( referent ) , 1.29 ( 0.87-1.91 ) , 1.05 ( 0.69-1.59 ) , 0.94 ( 0.61-1.44 ) , and 0.93 ( 0.59-1.45 ) in relation to quintiles of urinary arsenic concentrations of 1-36 , 37-66 , 67-114 , 115-204 , and > or = 205 microg/L , respectively .
We observed no association between arsenic exposure and prevalence of glucosuria and no evidence of an association between well water arsenic , total urinary arsenic , or the composition of urinary arsenic metabolites and HbA1c level .
CONCLUSIONS Our findings do not support an association of arsenic exposure from drinking water and a significantly increased risk of diabetes mellitus in the range of levels observed .
Further prospective studies would be valuable in confirming the findings .
