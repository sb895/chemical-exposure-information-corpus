Hair mercury levels were determined in 143 individuals from households of members in angling societies in an area of Sweden with many lakes that have freshwater fish with relatively high mercury levels .
Thus , the individuals had a potentially high intake of methyl mercury .
The mean mercury concentration of pike and perch was approximately 0.7 microg/g .
One-third of the subjects consumed these freshwater fish at least once a week .
As could be expected , there was a clear increase in hair Hg with reported freshwater fish consumption ( P < 0.001 ) .
The median mercury level in hair was 0.9 microg Hg/g for the whole group , and for those who reported consumption of freshwater fish at least once a week it was 1.8 microg/g .
The highest hair mercury level was 18.5 microg/g , in a man who consumed pike and perch several times per week .
Men had higher hair Hg than women , also when stratified for fish consumption .
This was verified in 32 couples , of which the man and woman consumed the same fish and reported the same consumption .
The median hair mercury level in these 32 couples was 1.3 microg/g for men and 0.8 microg/g for women ( P = 0.002 ) .
About half of the subjects had hair mercury exceeding 1 microg/g , corresponding to the reference dose ( RfD ) of 0.1 microg of mercury per kilogram body weight set by the US Environmental Protection Agency .
Although the RfD applies to all populations , the most at-risk group at these levels is pregnant women .
There were only 2 women ( of 12 ) of fertile age with hair mercury above 1 microg/g .
In Sweden pregnant women are advised not to eat perch and pike at all during pregnancy .
Since fish is rich in many important nutrients , it is unsatisfactory that fish consumption must be restricted , and thus there is a need to reduce mercury levels in fish .
