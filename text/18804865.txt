PCB levels in fish ( collected from local rivers ) , atmosphere and human milk samples have been studied to determine the exposure levels of PCBs for local residents and e-waste workers in Guiyu , a major electronic waste scrapping center in China .
The source appointment and correlation analyses showed that homologue composition of PCBs in 7 species of fish were consistent and similar to commercial PCBs Aroclor 1248 .
PCB levels in air surrounding the open burning site were significantly higher than those in residential area .
Inhalation exposure contributed 27% and 93% to the total body loadings ( the sum of dietary and inhalation exposure ) of the local residents , and e-waste workers engaged in open burning respectively .
Total PCB concentrations in human milk ranged from N.D. to 57.6 ng/g lipid , with an average of 9.50 ng/g lipid .
The present results indicated that commercial PCBs derived from e-waste recycling are major sources of PCBs accumulating in different environmental media , leading to the accumulation of high chlorinated biphenyls in human beings .
