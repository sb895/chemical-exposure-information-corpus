Methylmercury exposure in Amazonian communities through fish consumption has been widely documented in Brazil .
There is still a lack of data in other Amazonian countries , which is why we conducted this study in the Bolivian Amazon basin .
Simple random sampling was used from a small village located in the lower Beni River , where there is intense gold mining and high fish consumption .
All participants were interviewed and hair samples were taken to measure total mercury concentrations .
The hair mercury geometric mean in the general population was 3.02 microg/g ( CI : 2.69-3.37 ; range : 0.42-15.65 ) .
Age and gender were not directly associated with mercury levels .
Fish consumption showed a positive relation and so did occupation , especially small-scale gold mining .
Hair mercury levels were lower than those found in Brazilian studies , but still higher than in non-exposed populations .
It is necessary to assess mercury exposure in the Amazonian regions where data is still lacking , using a standardized indicator .
