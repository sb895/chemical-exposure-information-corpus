The aim of this study was to evaluate new working conditions in the construction industry in Estonia .
Three construction sites were investigated : a dwelling house at the stage of renovation , a warehouse at the stage of excavation and preparation work , and a hotel , where we examined the working conditions of the finishers .
Microclimate : air temperature , relative humidity and air velocity were determined at every workplace .
Full-shift personal exposure measurements of dust and gas exposure were performed among 97 construction workers in breathing zone air .
The concentration of lead in the air was analysed by AAS .
Vapours of benzene , styrene and toluene concentrations were determined by gas chromatography .
The noise level was measured with the help of the sound-level meter at every workplace .
All microclimatic indices were sometimes below or above exposure standards for indoor work .
High levels of airborne dust and increased concentrations of lead were observed during repair work .
Low concentrations of organic solvents in the air were determined when using paints and some synthetic substances .
The noise level exceeded the permitted limit when an excavator and powerful electric appliances were used .
A questionnaire determined the prevalence of subjectively experienced musculoskeletal strain in 30% of workers .
The working conditions in the construction industry in Estonia are approaching European level .
However , it is necessary to improve working conditions permanently by the use of new harmless materials , personal protective equipment , and through influencing worker health by permanent education and medical watch .
We consider that questionnaires are very important in the control of the work environment , in subjective health assessments , and as a source of useful proposals to improve working conditions .
