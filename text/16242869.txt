Organophosphates , used in agriculture , are readily absorbed through the skin .
We investigated the relationship between dermal and inhalative methyl parathion exposure and the plasma levels .
Twenty-three healthy wine growers sprayed the insecticide for 50 min .
Fluorescent brilliant sulfoflavin was added to the spraying fluids and filter papers were fixed on the subjects .
The filter papers were used to evaluate the amount of brilliant sulfoflavine on the unprotected skin fluorometrically .
Inhalative exposure was measured with personal air sampler .
Plasma concentrations of methyl parathion and its metabolite methyl paraoxon were determined with gas chromatography .
Cholinesterase activity in serum and erythrocytes was measured before and after exposure .
Some wine growers wore protective clothes , none protective gloves .
Dermal exposure ranged up to 12,044 microg , inhalative to 22 microg .
Maximum plasma concentration of methyl parathion was 12.1 microg/l .
Methyl paraoxon was not detectable .
Cholinesterase activity did not decrease .
Dermal exposure correlated with the methyl parathion plasma level ( Spearman's rho=0.72 , p<0.001 ) .
In conclusion , dermal exposure exceeded inhalative exposure considerably .
Measuring dermal deposition with the brilliant sulfoflavin technique may provide a good estimate of the internal load with methyl parathion .
Preventive measures should be improved as toxic effects of repeated exposure to low doses of methyl parathion cannot be excluded .
