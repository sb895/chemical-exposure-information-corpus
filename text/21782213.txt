Dental amalgam is 50% metallic mercury ( Hg ) by weight and Hg vapour continuously evolves from in-place dental amalgam , causing increased Hg content with increasing amalgam load in urine , faeces , exhaled breath , saliva , blood , and various organs and tissues including the kidney , pituitary gland , liver , and brain .
The Hg content also increases with maternal amalgam load in amniotic fluid , placenta , cord blood , meconium , various foetal tissues including liver , kidney and brain , in colostrum and breast milk .
Based on 2001 to 2004 population statistics , 181.1 million Americans carry a grand total of 1.46 billion restored teeth .
Children as young as 26 months were recorded as having restored teeth .
Past dental practice and recently available data indicate that the majority of these restorations are composed of dental amalgam .
Employing recent US population-based statistics on body weight and the frequency of dentally restored tooth surfaces , and recent research on the incremental increase in urinary Hg concentration per amalgam-filled tooth surface , estimates of Hg exposure from amalgam fillings were determined for 5 age groups of the US population .
Three specific exposure scenarios were considered , each scenario incrementally reducing the number of tooth surfaces assumed to be restored with amalgam .
Based on the least conservative of the scenarios evaluated , it was estimated that some 67.2 million Americans would exceed the Hg dose associated with the reference exposure level ( REL ) of 0.3 \u03bcg/m(3) established by the US Environmental Protection Agency ; and 122.3 million Americans would exceed the dose associated with the REL of 0.03 \u03bcg/m(3) established by the California Environmental Protection Agency .
Exposure estimates are consistent with previous estimates presented by Health Canada in 1995 , and amount to 0.2 to 0.4 \u03bcg/day per amalgam-filled tooth surface , or 0.5 to 1 \u03bcg/day/amalgam-filled tooth , depending on age and other factors .
