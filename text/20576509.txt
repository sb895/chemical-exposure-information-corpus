Studies of neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring exposed to MeHg from maternal consumption of fish have primarily measured cognitive abilities .
Reported associations have been subtle and in both adverse and beneficial directions .
Changes in functional outcomes such as school achievement and behavior in exposed children and adolescents have not been examined .
We undertook an assessment of school success of children in the Seychelles Child Development Study ( SCDS ) main cohort to determine if there were any associations with either prenatal or recent postnatal MeHg exposure .
The primary endpoints were Seychelles nationally standardized end-of-year examinations given when the cohort children were 9 and 17 years of age .
A subgroup ( n=215 ) from the main cohort was also examined at 9 years of age using a regional achievement test called SACMEQ .
Prenatal MeHg exposure was 6.8 ppm in maternal hair ; recent postnatal exposure was 6.09 ppm at 9 years and 8.0 ppm at 17 years , measured in child hair .
Multiple linear regression analyses showed no pattern of associations between prenatal or postnatal exposure , and either the 9- or 17-year end-of-year examination scores .
For the subgroup of 215 subjects who participated in the SACMEQ test , there were significant adverse associations between examination scores and postnatal exposure , but only for males .
The average postnatal exposure level in child hair for this subgroup was significantly higher than for the overall cohort .
These results are consistent with our earlier studies and support the interpretation that prenatal MeHg exposure at dosages achieved by mothers consuming a diet high in fish are not associated with adverse educational measures of scholastic achievement .
The adverse association of educational measures with postnatal exposure in males is intriguing , but will need to be confirmed by further studies examining factors that influence scholastic achievement .
