The environmental mercury contamination at the Tucuruí water reservoir was studied by measuring the amount of mercury in human hair samples collected from fishermen and their families .
Samples were also collected from the Parakanã Indian reservation in the vicinity to give information about the background levels in the area .
The mercury concentrations in hair samples ranged from 0.9 to 240 mg/kg .
The mean value in the main reservoir was 65 mg/kg .
Seven values exceeded 100 mg/kg and 31 values exceeded 50 mg/kg .
The hair Hg concentrations amongst the fishermen in Tucuruí reservoir are high enough to cause health effects .
The fetal exposure is especially alarming .
Changes in gold mining practises and in the human diet are recommended .
