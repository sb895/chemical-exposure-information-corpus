A detailed study was carried out in a cluster of villages known as Sagarpara Gram Panchayet ( GP ) , covering an area of 20 km2 and population of 24,419 to determine the status of groundwater arsenic contamination and related health effects .
The arsenic analysis of all hand tubewells ( n = 565 ) in working condition showed , 86.2% and 58.8% of them had arsenic above 10 , and 50 microgl(-1) , respectively .
The groundwater samples from all 21 villages in Sagarpara GP contained arsenic above 50 microgl(-1) .
In our preliminary clinical survey across the 21 villages , 3,302 villagers were examined and 679 among them ( 20.6% ) were registered with arsenical skin lesions .
A total of 850 biological samples ( hair , nail and urine ) were analysed from the affected villages and , on average , 85% of them contained arsenic above the normal level .
Thus , many people of Sagarpara might be sub-clinically affected .
Our data was compared with the international one to estimate population in Sagarpara GP at risk from arsenical skin lesions and cancer .
Proper watershed management and economical utilization of available surface water resources along with the villagers ' participation is urgently required to combat the present arsenic crisis .
