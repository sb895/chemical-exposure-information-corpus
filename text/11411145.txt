The aim of the study was to develop a sampling method aimed at individual sampling of mercury vapor and subsequent individual exposure assessment of the worker .
Hopcalite available from Inowroc\u0142awskie Zak\u0142ady Chemiczne ( in Poland ) was found useful for mercury vapor sampling in active and passive individual samplers .
However the sampling rate determined for passive sampler in steady-state laboratory chamber cannot be used under fluctuating conditions of mercury vapor concentration and air movement typical for field measurement .
In order to check comparativeness of passive and active sampling methods , samples were taken in the same time and individual samplers fixed to worker's clothes were used .
Mercury vapor concentration was measured at two chloralkali industries in Poland and the results were presented .
Excessive exposure in both industries was confirmed by finding elevated mercury concentration in urine samples from the workers .
