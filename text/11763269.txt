The human placenta as a body component is exposed to several harmful substances , depending upon the environmental conditions encountered .
In the case of toxic metals , placental tissue can be regarded as a dual biomarker to assess maternal and fetal health .
The average range of concentrations for toxic trace elements in placenta based on wet weight are found to be : cadmium 1-6 ng/g ; total mercury 2-13 ng/g ; methyl mercury 1-14 microg/g ; and lead 5-60 ng/g .
The placenta appears to be at least a partial barrier for Cadmium .
Cadmium transport includes a broad variety of mechanisms .
Once in circulation , it mainly interferes with Ca and Zn transportation .
On the other hand , placenta appears to be a weaker harrier for Pb than for Cd .
In the case of Hg , predominantly the organic form is absorbed and readily crosses the placenta .
In fetal blood , the organic mercury content is equal or even greater than in maternal blood , raising questions on normal fetal development .
Placenta as a biomarker could be taken as an alternative to repeated maternal blood sampling for assessing lead exposure in utero .
Placenta samples are usually obtained at the time of parturition , a one-time event .
Hence , each pregnancy has to be looked upon as an RTM ( real time monitoring ) process since the affected species is exposed to the placental source of pollutants only during the course of that particular pregnancy .
