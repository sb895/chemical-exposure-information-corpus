In order to assess the mercury exposure of pregnant and lactating women in Slovenia , levels of total mercury ( THg ) and methylmercury ( MeHg ) were determined in hair , cord blood and breast milk .
In addition , the frequency of fish consumption was estimated , because fish is generally the main pathway for human exposure to MeHg .
Hair samples were collected from 574 women participating in this study , while cord blood and breast milk samples were collected from 446 and 284 women , respectively .
As expected , the levels of THg in hair ( median ( Med)=297 ng/g , 10th percentile ( P10)=73 ng/g , 90th percentile ( P90)=781 ng/g ) , cord blood ( Med=1.5 ng/g , P10=0.5 ng/g , P90=4.2 ng/g ) and breast milk ( Med=0.2 ng/g , P10=0.06 ng/g , P90=0.6 ng/g ) were low , due to low consumption of fish ( X=25 g/day ) .
A significant linear correlation was found between levels of lnTHg in hair and lnTHg in cord blood ( r=0.87 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.84-0.89 ) , between levels of lnTHg in hair and lnMeHg in cord blood ( r=0.94 , 95% CI : 0.90-0.96 ) and between lnTHg levels in cord blood and lnTHg levels in breast milk ( r=0.36 , 95% CI : 0.25-0.47 ) .
Spearman's rank correlations between the frequency of fish consumption and THg in hair ( rs=0.35 , 95% CI : 0.28-0.42 ) , and between the frequency of fish consumption and THg in cord blood ( rs=0.43 , 95% CI : 0.36-0.51 ) or MeHg in cord blood ( rs=0.31 , 95% CI : 0.06-0.52 ) were weak .
This could be due to the approximate information on fish consumption obtained from the questionnaires , the high variability of MeHg concentrations in fish and a relatively high proportion of inorganic mercury in the biomarkers which originates from sources other than fish .
In conclusion , THg levels in cord blood , THg levels in hair and MeHg levels in cord blood are suitable biomarkers of low-level Hg exposure through fish consumption .
Compared to cord blood , hair samples are easy to collect , store and analyse .
