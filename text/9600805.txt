Health risks from amalgam fillings are a subject of controversy .
In Germany it is not advised to use amalgam fillings during breast feeding .
Objectives of this study were to examine the concentration of mercury in human breast milk and the confounders which may modify the mercury levels .
Women who gave birth between August 1995 and May 1996 in a district hospital were asked to participate in the study .
The examination included a standardized anamnesis and an inspection of the teeth by an dentist .
Blood and urine samples of 147 women and breast milk samples of 118 women were collected in the first week after birth .
After 2 months of breast feeding a second breast milk sample was collected from 85 of women .
Mercury was measured by cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry .
The concentration of mercury in the breast milk collected immediately after birth showed a significant association with the number of amalgam fillings as well as with the frequency of meals .
Urine mercury concentrations correlated with the number of amalgam fillings and amalgam surfaces .
In the breast milk after 2 months of lactation , the concentrations were lower ( mean : <0.25 microg/L ; range <0.25-11.7 microg/L ) compared with the first sample ( mean : 0.90 microg/L ; range <0.25-20. 3 microg/L ) and were positively associated with the fish consumption but no longer with the number of the amalgam fillings .
Accordingly , the additional exposure to mercury of breast-fed babies from maternal amalgam fillings is of minor importance compared to maternal fish consumption .
