Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed to detect cytogenetical alterations in 58 shoe workers ( 57 male and 1 female ) who had been exposed to particular mutagenic or carcinogenic agents and in 20 subjects selected from the general population as a control group .
Frequencies of damaged cells , including gaps , breaks , and rearrangements ( acentric fragment , deletion , translocations ) were scored for both groups .
The incidence of chromosomal aberrations ( particularly chromatid gaps and breaks ) in the study group was significantly higher than in the control group .
No effects of smoking were observed and breaks alone were found to be influenced by alcohol consumption .
No significant correlation was detected between the working period in the group exposed to benzene and frequency of chromosomal aberrations .
Benzene content was determined to be between 0 and 28.5% in eight kinds of glues studied by fractional distillation .
Hexane content ranged between 0 and 68.35% using the same method .
This study indicated that the content of benzene and hexane in the glues are above normal limits .
