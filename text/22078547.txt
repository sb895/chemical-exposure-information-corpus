Organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are synthetic chemicals that are highly resistant to biodegradation and have proven adverse health effects .
The objectives of this study were to determine concentrations of three selected organochlorine pesticides ( p,p'-DDT , p,p'-DDE , HCB ) and three specific PCB congeners ( PCB 138 , 153 , 180 ) in adipose tissue and serum samples from an urban adult population ( n=112 ) in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra , Bolivia , and to investigate their relationships within and between the two matrices and with selected socio-demographic characteristics .
The percentages of samples positive for these compounds ranged from 40% for PCB 180 to 100% for p,p'-DDE in adipose tissue , and from 21% for HCB to 93% for p,p'-DDE in serum .
Median number of residues per sample was five for adipose tissue and three for serum .
Geometric mean concentrations indicate a considerable historical and recent exposure to organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in this population .
Adipose tissue:serum ratios ranged from 149.3 to 590.3 ( wet basis ) and from 0.9 to 3.5 ( lipid basis ) .
We found positive and statistically significant correlations between adipose tissue and serum concentrations only in p,p'-DDE and HCB .
This novel study in Bolivia underlines the need for human biomonitoring to assess exposure to environmental pollutants in South America .
