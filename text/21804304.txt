Perfluorocarbons from common household products such as food containers , stain- resistant protection for clothing , furniture and carpets , paints , and fire-fighting foams are found in soil , water , plants , animal and human serum worldwide .
Previous research has shown a significant association between these chemicals and thyroid disease in women .
The present data from the C8 Health Project assessed thyroid function in a cross-sectional analysis of 52,296 adults with a year or more of exposure to perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) from drinking water .
Outcomes were : thyroxine , T3 uptake , and thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) .
Analyses were stratified by gender and age group ( < 20 - < 50 years and > 50 ) .
Both PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) were associated with significant elevations in serum thyroxine and a significant reduction in T3 uptake in all participants .
There were also significant gender/PFOS interactions for T3( )uptake and thyroxine , as well as gender/PFOA interactions for T3 uptake .
Results provide evidence for disruption of thyroid function related to these common chemicals and possible mechanisms are discussed .
