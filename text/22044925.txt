Organochlorine pesticides are ubiquitously present in the environment and suspected of carcinogenic , neurological and immunological effects .
Our objective was to identify determinants of adipose tissue levels of organochlorine pesticides experienced by a general Danish population .
Adipose tissue was collected upon enrolment of 245 randomly selected persons from a prospective cohort of 57,053 persons enrolled between 1993 and 1997 .
We examined geography , gender , age , lactation , body mass index ( BMI ) and intake of nine dietary groups and tap water drinks , as potential determinants of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) , dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene , hexachlorocyclohexane , dieldrin , hexachlorobenzene , cis-nonachlor , trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane .
Living in Copenhagen city and age at enrolment showed positive associations with all compounds .
BMI was positively associated with all compounds except cis-nonachlor .
Fatty-fish consumption showed positive associations with cis-nonachlor , trans-nonachlor , DDT and dieldrin and fruit and vegetables were inversely associated with dieldrin .
Determinant estimates of trans-nonachlor were similar to estimates of total chlordanes while cis-nonachlor and oxychlordane seemed to differ .
This is one of the first studies of organochlorine pesticides predictors in adipose tissue and contributes to the ongoing debate about exposure sources of these compounds .
Single determinants varied among the individual compounds , even within related chlordane residues , suggesting that organochlorine pesticides should not be treated as a homogenous group .
