Seafood , especially fish , is considered as a major dietary source of arsenic ( As ) .
Seafood consumption is recommended for nutritional properties but contaminant exposure should be considered .
The objectives were to assess As intake of frequent French seafood consumers and exposure via biomarkers .
Consumptions of 996 high consumers ( 18 and over ) of 4 coastal areas were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire .
Seafood samples were collected according to a total diet study ( TDS ) sampling method and analyzed for total As , arsenite ( AsIII ) , arsenate ( AsV ) , arsenobeta√Øne ( AsB ) , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) .
The average As dietary exposure is 94.7+/-67.5 microg/kg bw/week in females and 77.3+/-54.6 microg/kg bw/week in males ( p<0.001 ) and the inorganic As dietary exposure is respectively 3.34+/-2.06 microg/kg bw/week and 3.04+/-1.86 microg/kg bw/week ( p<0.05 ) .
Urine samples were collected from 382 of the subjects .
The average urinary As concentration is 94.8+/-250 microg/g creatinine for females and 59.7+/-81.8 microg/g for males ( p<0.001 ) .
Samples having an As concentration above 75 microg/g creatinine ( n=101 ) were analyzed for inorganic As ( As(III) , As(V) , MMA(V) and DMA(V) ) which was 24.6+/-27.9 microg/g creatinine for males and 27.1+/-20.6 microg/g for females .
Analyses do not show any correlation between dietary exposure and urinary As .
These results show that biological results should be interpreted cautiously .
Diet recording seems to be the best way to assess dietary As exposure .
Seafood is a high source of As exposure but even among high consumers it is not the main source of toxic As .
From a public health point of view these results should be interpreted carefully in the absence of international consensus on the health-based guidance value .
