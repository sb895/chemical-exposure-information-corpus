A pilot study on water consumption was carried out in the Qu√©bec City region in April and May 1996 with 125 people using a 24-h recall plus a 2-day diary .
Consumption of drinking water via liquid and food was assessed as well as the type of water consumed ( tap , bottle or filtered water ) and place of consumption ( home or away from home ) .
Most of the people ( 56% ) were drinking some bottled water or filtered tap water and 25% of water intake was away from home .
Food consumption was found to be a non-significant source of drinking-water intake .
The average water consumption was nearly similar in exclusively tap-water consumers and bottled- or filtered-water consumers ( 1.5 vs. 1.7 l/day , P = 0.29 ) but two-thirds of the consumption in this last group is natural water , while it is mixed water in the bottled/filtered-water group .
No significant difference in amounts consumed were found according to age , but older people drank hot beverages and soup more often .
The present pilot-study was weakened by a low participation rate ( 14% ) .
Incentive might be necessary to improve participation rate and data collection methods must also be simplified .
A 24-h recall plus a 1-day diary seem sufficient and data on consumption could be limited to liquids , soups and cereals .
