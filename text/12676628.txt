We studied exposure to methyl mercury ( MeHg ) in Swedish pregnant women ( total mercury [ T-Hg ] in hair ) and their fetuses ( MeHg in cord blood ) in relation to fish intake .
The women were recruited at antenatal care clinics in late pregnancy to participate in an exposure study of environmental pollutants .
Fish consumption was evaluated using food frequency questionnaires including detailed questions on fish consumption .
In addition , we determined inorganic mercury ( I-Hg ) and selenium ( Se ) in cord blood .
On average , the women consumed fish ( all types ) 6.7 times/month ( range 0-25 times/month ) during the year they became pregnant .
They reported less consumption of freshwater fish--species that might contain high concentrations of MeHg--during than before pregnancy .
T-Hg in maternal hair ( median 0.35 mg/kg ; range 0.07-1.5 mg/kg ) was significantly associated ( R2 = 0.53 ; p < 0.001 ) with MeHg in cord blood ( median 1.3 microg/L ; range 0.10-5.7 microg/L ) .
Both hair T-Hg and cord blood MeHg increased with increasing consumption of seafood ( r = 0.41 ; p < 0.001 and r = 0.46 ; p < 0.001 , respectively ) .
Segmental hair analysis revealed that T-Hg closer to the scalp was lower and more closely correlated with MeHg in cord blood than T-Hg levels in segments corresponding to earlier in pregnancy .
We found a weak association between Se ( median 86 microg/L ; range 43-233 microg/L ) and MeHg in cord blood ( r = 0.26 ; p = 0.003 ) , but no association with fish consumption .
I-Hg in cord blood ( median 0.15 microg/L ; range 0.03-0.53 microg/L ) increased significantly with increasing number of maternal dental amalgam fillings .
