Punjab state in India is an agrarian society , where agriculture is the lifeline of farming community .
To keep pace with increasing demands of food for growing population the indiscriminate use of pesticides has led to the contamination of environment and food commodities in this region .
Analysis of human breast milk samples ( n=53 ) for pesticide residues revealed the presence of \u03b2- , \u03b3-HCH , p,p ' DDD , p,p ' DDE , p,p ' DDT and endrin with mean concentration of 97.9 , 101.7 , 239.8 , 1574.1 , 100.3 and 90.7 ng g(-1) lipid wt. , respectively .
In addition , occurrence of \u03b2-endosulfan , endosulfan sulphate , cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos in this study have also been reported for the first time in human breast milk in Punjab , India .
With increase in parity , HCH and DDT residue burden in donor's milk decreased .
Although levels of HCH and DDT residues in breast milk samples have decreased significantly , yet estimated daily intake values for DDT are higher than the FAO/WHO permissible tolerable daily intake values for few infants .
