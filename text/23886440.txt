Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) have recently received attention due to their widespread contamination of the environment .
PFOS and PFOA are stable in the environment and resistant to metabolism , hydrolysis , photolysis and biodegradation .
PFOS and PFOA have been found in human blood and tissue samples from both occupationally exposed workers and the general worldwide population .
This study aimed to determine the background levels of PFOS and PFOA in the Taiwanese population , investigate related factors , and compare exposure in Taiwan to that in other countries .
The concentration of PFOS in the 59 serum samples collected from the general population in Taiwan ranged from 3.45 to 25.65ngmL(-1) ( median : 8.52 ) , and the concentration of PFOA ranged from 1.55 to 7.69ngmL(-1) ( median : 3.22 ) .
There was a significant positive correlation ( r=0.51 ; p<0.0001 ) between PFOS and PFOA concentrations .
Males had higher concentrations of PFOA and PFOS than females .
PFOS levels in serum increased with age .
This study is the first investigation to reveal the PFOS and PFOA levels of serum samples in the general population of Taiwan .
The levels of PFOS and PFOA in Taiwanese serum samples were comparable with those from other countries ( PFOS : 5.0-35ngmL(-1) , PFOA : 1.5-10ngmL(-1) ) .
