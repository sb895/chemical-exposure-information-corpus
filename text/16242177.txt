This work presents quality control results on the mercury concentrations in different environmental ( river sediments , forest soils , river suspended matter and fish ) and human samples from the lower Madeira River , Amazon sampled between 2001 and 2003 , about 15-20 years after the nearly cessation of gold mining activities in the region , which reached its peak in the late 1980s .
The study aimed to compare mercury concentrations in these environmental samples with those reported by other authors during the gold rush of the Madeira River Basin .
Today , in the Madeira River the releases of mercury register a sudden reduction due the gold price fall in the international trade .
However , about 100 t of Hg were released to the atmosphere and to aquatic systems in the region during the gold rush .
The present survey shows that notwithstanding the reduction of Hg emissions to the Madeira River Basin from gold mining proper , concentrations in fish and humans are similar to those measured during the gold rush .
Reduction in Hg concentrations is restricted to areas close to old point sources and only for abiotic compartments ( air and sediments ) .
Remobilization of Hg from bottom sediments plus re-emission from soils due to land use changes are probably responsible for keeping high Hg concentrations in biological samples .
