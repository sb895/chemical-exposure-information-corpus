High levels of cadmium ( Cd ) in paddy soil and rice , and a concurrent increase in urinary Cd of inhabitants in the Mae Sot District , Tak Province , Thailand first emerged in 2003 .
Risk factors such as occupation , sources of staple food and drinking water as well as biomarkers of adverse renal effects of the increased body burden of Cd were investigated in 795 residents , 30 years or older , whose urinary Cd levels were between 0.02 and 106mug/g creatinine .
Farmers who consumed their own rice and residents who sourced drinking water from wells and/or the river demonstrated increased urinary Cd .
Age-adjusted mean urinary cadmium for male and female subjects who consumed well water was 5.7mug/g vs. 6.1mug/g creatinine while the corresponding value for male and female subjects who did not consume well water was 3.7mug/g vs. 4.8mug/g creatinine , respectively .
Increased urinary levels of beta(2)-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase were observed with the increase in urinary Cd , indicating tubular dysfunction and renal damage associated with increase in Cd body burden .
Consumption of well water and rice grown in the contaminated area increase the body burden of Cd .
Cessation of exposure is essential to prevent and possibly recover from Cd toxicity , especially among the residents whose kidney damage and malfunction may be reversible .
