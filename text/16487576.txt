Arsenic from chromated copper arsenate ( CCA)-treated wood , widely used in playgrounds and other outdoor equipment , can persist as surface residues on wood .
This raises concerns about possible health risks associated with children playing on CCA-treated playgrounds .
In a Pilot Study , 11 children ( 13-71 months ) in homes with and without CCA-treated playgrounds were evaluated with post-exposure hand rinses and urine for total arsenic .
Samples of wood , soil , and mulch , as well as synthetic wipes , were sampled for total arsenic .
In non-CCA-treated playgrounds vs. CCA-treated playgrounds , respectively , wood arsenic was <2.0 mg/kg vs. mean arsenic 2370 mg/kg ( range 1440-3270 mg/kg ) ; soil arsenic was <3.0 mg/kg vs. mean arsenic of 19 mg/kg ( range 4.0-42 mg/kg ) ; mulch arsenic at one non-CCA-treated playground was 0.4 mg/kg vs. two CCA-treated playgrounds of 0.6 and 69 mg/kg .
The arsenic removed using a synthetic wipe at non-CCA-treated playgrounds was <0.5 microg , while mean arsenic from CCA-treated wood was 117 microg ( range 1.0-313 ) .
The arsenic mass from hand rinses for children who played at non-CCA-treated playgrounds was <0.2 microg , while mean arsenic mass was 0.6 microg ( range <0.2-1.9 ) at CCA-treated playgrounds .
Mean urinary total arsenic levels were 13.6 pg/ml ( range 7.2-23.1 pg/ml ) for all children evaluated , but there was no association between access to CCA-playgrounds and urinary arsenic levels .
Arsenic speciation was not performed .
This preliminary Pilot Study of CCA-treated wood playgrounds observed dislodgeable arsenic on 11 children's hands after brief periods of play exposure .
Future efforts should increase the number of children and the play exposure periods , and incorporate speciation in order to discriminate between various sources of arsenic .
