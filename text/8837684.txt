Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEPs ) were examined in 49 workers employed in a printing press , who were occupationally exposed to low concentrations of toluene for an average of 20.3 years , and in 59 subjects in a control group .
In the group of exposed workers , a significant decrease was found in all wave amplitudes examined , a significant prolongation of P1 wave latency , and an increased interval of interpeak latencies ( P3-P5 ) , indicating that the extramedullary and high medullary part of the auditory pathway are biologically most frequently affected by chronic exposure to low concentrations of toluene .
The level of exposure to toluene in both groups was evaluated by defining the concentration of toluene in peripheral blood and the concentration of hippuric acid and ortho-cresol in urine .
