The use of most polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) has been restricted in China ; however , their use remains a concern because of their adverse effects on human health , especially on fetuses and infants .
To date , there is no data regarding the exposure levels of pregnant women to PCBs and OCPs in Shanghai .
In order to evaluate PCB and OCP exposure levels and the contribution of dietary habits to these levels , we determined the concentrations of 8 PCBs and 14 OCPs in the umbilical cord blood serum of healthy pregnant women in Shanghai .
Dietary habits of the pregnant women were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire .
Results showed that p , p'-DDE , HCB and \u03b2-HCH were the major pollutants present in the serum samples ; PCBs were detected in a few samples at low concentrations .
Age , weight and body mass index before delivery were positively associated with serum levels of p , p'-DDE and \u03b2-HCH .
Women and their husbands who had higher education levels , higher income levels , tended to have higher levels of p , p'-DDE and \u03b2-HCH .
Spearman correlation analysis results suggested that consumption of foods such as milk , eggs , meat , fish , and shrimp may contribute to higher serum levels of p , p'-DDE and \u03b2-HCH .
Furthermore , multiple linear regression analyses indicated that the age and educational levels of the pregnant women and their intake of fried/flamed food and shellfish were positively associated with \u03b2-HCH levels , and that the age and educational levels of the pregnant women and their intake of parity , beef , pork , mutton , and shrimp were positively associated with p , p'-DDE levels .
This is the first study to investigate the exposure levels of pregnant women to PCBs and OCPs in Shanghai , and it should provide useful information for future related research .
