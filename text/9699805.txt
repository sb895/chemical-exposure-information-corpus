The urinary excretion levels of sodium ( Na ) and potassium ( K ) in cadmium ( Cd)-exposed subjects as related with urinary beta2-microglobulin ( beta2-MG ) and Cd concentrations were investigated .
The target population comprised of 3164 inhabitants of Japan who were more than 50 years of age and who lived in cadmium-polluted areas and 294 inhabitants who lived in non-polluted areas of Japan .
A significant increase in urinary excretion of K was shown in Cd-exposed subjects although there was no significant difference in urinary excretion of Na between the Cd-exposed and non-exposed subjects .
Urinary K concentrations in both sexes were significantly correlated with age , urinary beta2-MG and Cd concentrations by multiple regression analysis .
Urinary Na concentration was significantly correlated with age , beta2-MG and Cd in men , but in women it was significantly associated with only the urinary beta2-MG concentration .
The present study demonstrated that increased K excretion was a more sensitive effect of cadmium exposure than increased Na excretion .
