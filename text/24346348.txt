The aim of the present work was to investigate the exposure to lead from various sources by investigation of mineral composition of human scalp hair .
The research was carried out on hair sampled from 267 young adults living in Wroc\u0142aw ( southwest Poland ) .
The effect of the place of residence , diet , and lifestyle on lead content in hair was examined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry ( ICP-OES ) .
Lead was determined at the wavelength 220.353 nm .
These outcomes were reached by linking the results of lead level in hair with the results of questionnaire survey .
The mean lead level in hair of the whole examined population was 2.01 ± 2.10 mg kg(-1) .
Lead can enter the human body mainly by inhalation and gastrointestinal absorption .
It was found that consuming cheese , fish , and lettuce caused increased level of lead in hair .
On the other hand , drinking of milk , tea , coffee , or lemon resulted in decreased content of lead in hair .
Additional source of exposure to lead could be cigarette smoking , distance to the traffic road , painting the walls , amalgam filling .
Based on the results , it can be concluded that exposure to lead can occur mainly from eating habits and environmental exposure .
