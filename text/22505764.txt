There are concerns that prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals increases children's risk of obesity .
African-American and Hispanic children born in the Bronx or Northern Manhattan , New York ( 1998-2006 ) , whose mothers underwent personal air monitoring for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) exposure during pregnancy , were followed up to ages 5 ( n = 422 ) and 7 ( n = 341 ) years .
At age 5 years , 21% of the children were obese , as were 25% of those followed to age 7 years .
After adjustment for child's sex , age at measurement , ethnicity , and birth weight and maternal receipt of public assistance and prepregnancy obesity , higher prenatal PAH exposures were significantly associated with higher childhood body size .
In adjusted analyses , compared with children of mothers in the lowest tertile of PAH exposure , children of mothers in the highest exposure tertile had a 0.39-unit higher body mass index z score ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.08 , 0.70 ) and a relative risk of 1.79 ( 95% CI : 1.09 , 2.96 ) for obesity at age 5 years , and they had a 0.30-unit higher body mass index z score ( 95% CI : 0.01 , 0.59 ) , a 1.93-unit higher percentage of body fat ( 95% CI : 0.33 , 3.54 ) , and a relative risk of 2.26 ( 95% CI : 1.28 , 4.00 ) for obesity at age 7 years .
The data indicate that prenatal exposure to PAHs is associated with obesity in childhood .
