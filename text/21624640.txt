The antagonistic effects between selenium ( Se ) and arsenic ( As ) suggest that low Se status plays an important role in arsenism development .
The objective of present study was to assess Se contents in biological samples of As exposed females have skin lesions and cancer with related to non-exposed skin cancer patients .
The biological samples ( blood and scalp hair ) of As exposed group comprises , female skin cancer ( ESC ) patients admitted in cancer hospitals have skin lesions ( ESL ) and exposed referents have not both diseases ( ER ) , belongs to As exposed area of Pakistan .
For comparative purposes , age matched female skin cancerous patient ( RP ) and non-cancerous females ( NER ) belong to non-exposed areas were also selected .
The As and Se in acid digests of biological samples were pre-concentrated by complexing with chelating agent ( ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ) , and resulted complexes were extracted into non-ionic extractant ( Triton X-114 ) , prior to analysis by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry .
The enhancement factor of about 25 was obtained by pre-concentrating 10 mL of sample solutions .
The accuracy of the optimized procedure was evaluated by using certified reference material ( BCR 397 ) with certified values for Se and As and standard addition method at three concentration levels in real samples .
No significant differences was observed ( p>0.05 ) when comparing the values obtained by the proposed method , added and certified values of both elements .
The biological samples of ESC patients had 2-3 folds higher As and lower Se levels as compared to RP ( p<0.001 ) .
Understudied exposed referents have high level of As and lower Se contents as compared to referents subjects of non-exposed area ( p<0.01 ) .
The higher concentration of As and lower levels of Se in biological samples of cancerous patients are consisted with reported studies .
