Triclosan is a chlorinated phenol ether that has been in widespread use as a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for four decades .
When compared to the limited international data available on human body burden of triclosan , results from a pooled blood study suggested that triclosan concentrations in Australia were a factor two higher than observed in Sweden .
This study determined triclosan levels in individual human milk samples ( n=151 ) collected between 2002 and 2005 from primiparous Australian mothers .
It provided the first report of population triclosan levels and individual variation in Australia and gave a measure of infant exposure via breast feeding .
The distribution of triclosan concentration was positively skewed , with 7.2% of the samples below the LOQ , 66% with a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 ng g(-1)fresh weight and the remaining samples above 1 ng g(-1) reaching a maximum concentration of 19 ng g(-1)fresh weight .
The mean and median triclosan concentrations were 1.3Â±2.7 ng g(-1)f.w. and 0.26 ng g(-1)f.w. , respectively .
The results of this study showed high variability in triclosan concentrations between individuals and no correlations with maternal age ( p=0.094 ) , maternal weight ( p=0.971 ) or infant age at the time of sample collection ( p=0.621 ) .
A large number of samples contained low or non-quantifiable concentrations of triclosan and so , in Australia , ubiquitous background exposure due to environmental sources is low .
This means that body burden can be influenced by an individual's use of triclosan containing product .
Given that triclosan containing product use is continuing , it is important that monitoring in both humans and the environment is continued and that triclosan containing products are adequately labeled so that an individual can choose to avoid exposure .
