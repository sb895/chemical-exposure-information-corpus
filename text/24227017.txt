We investigated associations between short-term exposure to air pollution and central augmentation index and augmentation pressure , correlates of arterial stiffness , in a cohort of elderly men in the Boston , Massachusetts , metropolitan area .
This longitudinal analysis included 370 participants from the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study with up to 2 visits between 2007 and 2011 ( n = 445 ) .
Augmentation index ( as % ) and augmentation pressure ( in mmHg ) were measured at each visit by using radial artery applanation tonometry for pulse wave analysis and modeled in a mixed effects regression model as continuous functions of moving averages of air pollution exposures ( over 4 hours and 1 , 3 , 7 , and 14 days ) .
The results suggest that short-term changes in air pollution were associated with augmentation index and augmentation pressure at several moving averages .
Interquartile range ( IQR ) increases in 3-day average exposure to particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm ( 3.6-\u03bcg/m(3) IQR increase ) and sulfate ( 1.4-\u03bcg/m(3) IQR increase ) and 1-day average exposure to particle number counts ( 8,741-counts/cm(3) IQR increase ) were associated with augmentation index values that were 0.8% ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.2 , 1.4 ) , 0.6% ( 95% CI : 0.1 , 1.2 ) , and 1.7% ( 95% CI : 0.4 , 2.9 ) higher , respectively .
Overall , the findings were similar for augmentation pressure .
The findings support the hypothesis that exposure to air pollution may affect vascular function .
