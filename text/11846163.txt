Dental amalgam fillings are known to release significant amounts of mercury ( Hg ) in saliva which could represent a continuous source of oxidative damage to mouth tissues .
The present investigation was aimed at verifying this hypothesis by determining a possible correlation between salivary Hg levels and salivary total antioxidant activity ( TAA ) , which is used as an index of oxidative stress .
Samples of saliva from 34 healthy donors were analyzed for Hg content , by vapor atomic absorption spectrometry , and for TAA , by determining the ferric reducing ability ( 'FRAP ' method ) .
A significant correlation between Hg and the number of amalgam restorations or total amalgam surface was evident in both the male and female subjects .
A significant negative correlation between TAA and Hg levels or number of amalgam restorations or amalgam surface was evident in females , indicating that small increases in salivary Hg were sufficient to produce a decrease in salivary TAA .
On the other hand , no significant correlation was found in the males .
The present study provides , for the first time , evidence of a pro-oxidant role of the amalgam Hg chronically released in saliva .
