Contemporaneous associations between circulating maternal organochlorines ( OCs ) and measures of fetal heart rate and motor activity were evaluated .
A panel of 47 OCs , including pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , was analyzed from serum of 50 pregnant women at 36 weeks gestation .
Data were empirically reduced into four factors and six individual compounds .
All participants had detectable concentrations of at least one-quarter of the assayed OCs and , in general , higher socioeconomic level was associated with higher OC concentrations .
Fetal heart rate measures were not consistently associated with maternal OCs .
In contrast , one or more indicators of greater fetal motor activity were significantly associated with higher levels of the DDT and low chlorinated OC factors and five of the six individual compounds ( heptachlor epoxide , trans nonachlor , oxychlordane , and PCBs 18 and 52 ) .
This preliminary demonstration of associations between fetal motor activity and maternal concentrations of persistent and pervasive environmental contaminants suggests that fetal assessment may be useful in ascertaining the potential early effects of these compounds on development.Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication , 17 April 2013 ; doi:10.1038/jes.2013.19 .
