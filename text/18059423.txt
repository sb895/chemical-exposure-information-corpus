Allergens in house dust are risk factors for asthma causation and exacerbation , and asthma interventions often focus on exposure reduction using methods that may not be sustainable over time in low-income communities .
A randomized controlled trial with up to six home visits was used to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions focused on reducing dust loading and allergen concentrations in 47 low-income inner-city households in Minneapolis , MN .
The interventions , which included education and relatively inexpensive cleaning procedures , were developed using a community-based participatory consultation process with focus groups held in English , Somali , and Spanish to incorporate community feedback from participants into protocols and study design decisions .
Change in levels of cat , cockroach , dust mite , and culturable fungi as well as overall dust loading were evaluated by measuring the difference in concentrations before and after the cleaning intervention , and mixed models were used to assess the effect of education and cleaning on baseline allergen levels during the final three home visits .
The cleaning intervention significantly lowered dust loading in all households and culturable fungi levels in single family homes , reduced cat allergen concentrations in homes with cats , but had no significant effect on cockroach allergen levels .
The cleaning intervention also modestly decreased the frequency of observed allergen concentrations above suggested health benchmarks for cat , cockroach , and fungi .
The cleaning and education interventions had similar effects on baseline allergen levels measured during subsequent home visits ; both interventions significantly reduced baseline levels of cat and fungal allergens observed in pre-cleaning samples , but had no significant effect on cockroach allergen levels .
Overall , the cleaning intervention modestly reduced potential exposure to risk factors associated with asthma mortality and morbidity in a way that can be implemented by most homeowners or renters , independent of education , income , or the ability to speak English .
