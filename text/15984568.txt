Cigarette consumption during pregnancy produces deleterious effects in both , mother and fetus , some of them due to the presence of toxic elements in cigarette smoke , such as cadmium .
Placenta constitutes a dual-purpose specimen for evaluating the pollutant burden exerted on the mother as well as on the fetus .
The main objective of this study was to establish a correlation between placental concentration and distribution of some metal elements and birth weight of neonates delivered by mothers , who were either moderate smokers or nonsmokers .
Forty nonsmoking and moderate smoking pregnant women paired per age , parity , weight , height and body mass index were selected .
Smoking was assessed by self-reported cigarette consumption during pregnancy and urine cotinine concentration before delivery .
Placental metal concentrations were evaluated by atomic absorption spectrometry ( copper and cadmium ) and neutron activation analysis ( zinc and iron ) .
Newborns from smokers had lower birth weights compared to infants from nonsmokers .
Birth weights were correlated with placental cadmium concentrations in both , smokers and nonsmokers .
Placental zinc and cadmium of smokers were mainly located at the maternal side and their levels were higher than those found in nonsmoker's placentas .
In addition , all metal nutrient/pollutant ratios were decreased in the smoker group .
In this first study performed in our region , we found that moderate smoking mothers deliver neonates with decreased birth weight and highly correlated to placental cadmium concentration .
Decreased metal nutrient/pollutant ratios , a condition here found in smokers , may indicate a placental dysfunction , contributing to impair birth weight .
