Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( DEHP ) is a general-purpose plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) and has become a ubiquitous environmental contaminant .
It is suspected to be an endocrine disrupting/modulating substance in humans .
Children are of special concern due to their developmental state .
In our study we estimated the daily DEHP intake of 239 children aged 2-14 years by extrapolating from their urinary levels of the DEHP metabolites mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)phthalate ( 5OH-MEHP ) , mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)phthalate ( 5oxo-MEHP ) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( MEHP ) .
We applied two calculation models based upon the volume and the creatinine-related urinary metabolite concentrations .
Applying the volume- or the creatinine-based calculation model we determined a median daily DEHP intake of 7.8 or 4.3 microg/kgbody weight ( bw)/day and a 95th percentile of 25.2 or 15.2 microg/kgbw/day .
Three children ( 1% ) exceeded the value of the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) of the European Food Safety Authority of 50 microg/kgbw/day , while 7.5% or 3% ( depending on the calculation model ) exceeded the reference dose ( RfD ) of 20 microg/kgbw/day of the US Environmental Protection Agency .
In general , DEHP exposure was decreasing with increasing age and boys had higher exposures than girls .
Our findings suggest that the majority of the children in the general population is exposed to quantities of DEHP below the TDI and the RfD .
However , many children scoop out the preventive limit values to a considerable degree and in individual cases we observed substantial transgressions .
Younger children seem to be more severely burdened , which may be due to a higher food consumption related to their bw , mouthing behaviour and/or playing near the ground .
