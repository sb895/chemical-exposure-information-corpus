For the first nationwide representative survey on the environmental health of children and adolescents in Korea , we designed the Korean Environmental Health Survey in Children and Adolescents ( KorEHS-C ) as a two-phase survey and planned a sampling strategy that would represent the whole population of Korean children and adolescents , based on the school unit for the 6-19 years age group and the household unit for the 5 years or less age group .
A pilot study for 351 children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years in elementary , middle , and high school of two cities was performed to validate several measurement methods and tools , as well as to test their feasibility , and to elaborate the protocols used throughout the survey process .
Selected exposure biomarkers , i.e. , lead , mercury , cadmium in blood , and bisphenol A , metabolites of diethylhexyl phthalate and di-n-butyl phthalate and cotinine in urine were analyzed .
We found that the levels of blood mercury ( Median : 1.7 ug/L ) and cadmium ( Median : 0.30 ug/L ) were much higher than those of subjects in Germany and the US , while metabolites of phthalates and bisphenol A showed similar levels and tendencies by age ; the highest levels of phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A occurred in the youngest group of children .
Specific investigations to elucidate the exposure pathways of major environmental exposure need to be conducted , and the KorEHS-C should cover as many potential environmental hazards as possible .
