The objective of the present study was to investigate the principle relationships between concentrations in human and environmental matrices of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) in short distance comparable areas within Saxony , Germany by employing the data of the German Environmental Specimen Banking ( ESB ) .
Examples supporting this idea were presented by selecting data on blood plasma collected from students in University of Halle and pine shoots , egg matter of city pigeons , earthworm , and roe deer liver .
Similar pattern for PCB 138 and PCB 180 was found for the human plasma and pine shoots samples during investigated years and the human data followed the corresponding environmental levels with some delay of approximately two years .
However , PCB 153 that was the prevailing congener did not manifest this relationship .
In addition , the correlation of the ratios of concentrations ( human/environmental concentration ) to some physicochemical constants such as molecular weight ( MW ) , octanol-water partition coefficient ( logK(ow) ) , Henry's law constant ( K(H) ) , and sorption partition coefficient ( logK(oc) ) of HCB , PCB 138 , PCB 153 , and PCB 180 were studied .
The resulted negative slopes with all constants in case of blood plasma/city pigeons egg matter pairs suggested that the accumulation of lipophilic compounds is more pronounced in pigeon eggs than in human blood .
