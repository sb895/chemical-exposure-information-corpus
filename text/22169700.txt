Several studies have pointed out associations between various metals and cardiovascular disease .
Since cardiovascular disease prevalence is different between males and females , we investigated whether circulating levels of metals related differently to coronary risk in men and women .
In the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors ( PIVUS ) study , coronary risk was assessed by the Framingham Risk Score together with circulating blood levels of 11 different trace and heavy metals in 1016 subjects aged 70 years .
Circulating levels of cadmium , copper and manganese were significantly higher in women than in men , while mercury , zinc and lead were significantly lower following adjustment for kidney function ( measured by glomerular filtration rate , GFR ) .
No significant differences between women and men were seen regarding levels of aluminium , molybdenum , cobalt , chromium and nickel .
When all 11 metals were entered as independent variables together with GFR in multiple models in the Framingham Risk Score as the dependent variable , cadmium was the major determinant of the Framingham Risk Score in women ( p<0.0001 , followed by zinc p=0.03 ) , while copper was the major determinant of the Framingham Risk Score in men ( p<0.0001 , followed by inverse relations vs. aluminium p=0.01 and nickel p=0.01 ) .
There are gender differences in levels of metals and also regarding the association between metals and coronary risk , with cadmium levels being most important for women and copper levels for men in this elderly population .
