The contamination of traditional foods with chemical pollutants is a challenge to the food security of Aboriginal Peoples .
Mercury levels are generally low in terrestrial animals ; however renal mercury levels have been shown to change over time in the Porcupine Caribou Herd , the principal food source for the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation of Old Crow in Yukon , Canada .
Seventy-five Porcupine Caribou muscle , sixty-three kidney and three liver samples were analyzed for total mercury .
Average concentrations were 0.003 , 0.360 and 0.120mg/kg wet weight total mercury for muscle , kidney and liver , respectively .
Consumption data of caribou muscle , kidney and liver were collected from twenty-six adults in Vuntut Gwitchin households .
Women of child-bearing age ( n=5 ) consumed a median of 71.5g/person/day of caribou muscle and 0.0g/person/day kidney but consumed no liver ; median consumptions for all other adults ( women aged 40+ and all men , n=21 ) were 75.8 , 3.2 and 2.5g/person/day for meat , kidney and liver , respectively .
Median dietary exposures to total mercury from caribou tissues were estimated to be 0.138\u03bcg/kg body weight for women of child-bearing age and 0.223\u03bcg/kg body weight for other adults .
Caribou tissues were found to contribute high levels of important nutrients to the diet and pose minimal health risk from mercury exposure .
