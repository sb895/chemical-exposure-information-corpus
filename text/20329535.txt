Twenty-four indoor and fifteen outdoor dust samples were collected from an electronic waste ( e-waste ) area , South China in October 2006 and October 2007 and analyzed for seventeen PBDE congeners .
PBDEs were detected in all dust samples .
The total PBDE concentrations for indoor dusts ranged from 230-157500 ng/g , with a mean value of 9 400 ng/g , and 212-25 880 ng/g , with a mean value of 3 311 ng/g for outdoor samples , respectively .
The PBDE concentrations in the present study were at the high end of the worldwide figures .
BDE209 was the predominant congener .
Comparison of the PBDE congener patterns in dusts and technical products suggests that the relatively high abundances of octa- to nona-PBDE congeners in the dusts might be originated from the degradation of BDE209 .
The average exposure estimates of PBDEs via dusts are 470 , 329 and 188 ng/d for infants , toddlers and adults , respectively .
The highest exposure estimates for infants and toddlers ( 31 500 and 19 700 ng/d ) were 4 and 2.5 fold higher than those for adults .
These results indicate that dust may be a very important route of exposure for PBDEs in local residents .
