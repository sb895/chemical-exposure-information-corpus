BACKGROUND On April-May , 2011 , two Taiwan chemical companies were found to have intentionally added phthalates , Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) and/or Di-isononyl phthalate , as a substitute of emulsifier to many foodstuffs .
This study aimed to investigate whether exposure to these foods altered endocrine functions in children aged \u226410 years and , if so , whether those changes could be reversed by stopping exposure .
METHODS One Phthalates Clinic for Children was established in southern Taiwan between May 31 and June 17 , 2011 .
All eligible children had their exposure information , blood and/or urine specimens collected .
Endocrine functions were assessed in serum .
The exposure groups were categorized into three ( High , >500 ppm , Low , 1-500 ppm , and No , <1 ppm of DEHP ) .
After six months , some children were followed up for the selected endocrine hormones .
RESULTS Sixty children were eligible in this study ; all were Tanner stage 1 with no pubic hair .
Compared to non-exposed group , both high and low exposure groups had significantly lower serum thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels ( P\u200a=\u200a0.001 and 0.024 ) .
At six months follow-up , serum triiodothyronine ( T3 ) levels was significantly changed ( P\u200a=\u200a0.034 ) in high exposure group ( n\u200a=\u200a13 ) .
For serum estradiol ( E2 ) , the detectable rate ( \u22658 pg/mL ) decreased from 76.9% ( 10/13 ) to 30.8% ( 4/13 ) ( P\u200a=\u200a0.070 ) .
CONCLUSIONS This study shows that serum TSH levels can be altered when children were exposed to high concentrations of phthalate-tainted foodstuffs .
Serum E2 and T3 may be partially recovered after stopping exposure .
