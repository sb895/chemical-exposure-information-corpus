This pilot study was conducted to identify the metals used by home-based Native American jewelry makers , to quantify the metals in dust samples taken from jewelers ' homes , and to compare these concentrations with background levels from control homes in which jewelry was not made .
Participants were recruited from Zuni Pueblo , New Mexico .
Surface dust samples were collected from the work and living areas of 20 jewelers ' homes , and from the living areas of 20 control homes .
Silver , copper , tin , boron , nickel , zinc , lead , and cadmium were significantly higher in work areas than in living areas of jewelry-making homes ( p < or = 0.02 ) .
Silver , copper , nickel , and antimony were significantly higher in living areas of jewelers ' homes compared with control homes ( p < or = 0.04 ) .
Ventilation measures did not effectively reduce metal concentrations in jewelers ' homes ; concentrations in nonwork areas remained elevated .
