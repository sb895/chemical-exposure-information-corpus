In recent decades , ambient air pollution has been an important public health issue in Beijing , but little is known about air pollution and health effects after the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
We conduct a time-series analysis to evaluate associations between daily mortality ( nonaccidental , cardiovascular and respiratory mortality ) and the major air pollutants ( carbon monoxide , nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter less than 10 Âµm in aerodynamic diameter ) in Beijing during the two years ( 2009,2010 ) after the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
We used generalized additive model to analyze relationship between daily mortality and air pollution .
In single air pollutant model with two-day moving average concentrations of the air pollutants , increase in their interquartile range ( IQR ) associated with percent increase in nonaccidental mortality , 2.55 percent [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.99 , 3.11 ] for CO , 2.54 percent ( 95% CI : 2.00 , 3.08 ) for NO2 and 1.80 percent ( 95% CI : 1.21 , 2.40 ) for PM10 , respectively ; increases in the IQR of air pollutant concentrations associated with percent increase in cardiovascular mortality , 2.88 percent ( 95% CI : 2.10,3.65 ) for CO , 2.63 percent ( 95% CI : 1.87 , 3.39 ) for NO2 and 1.72 percent ( 95% CI : 0.88 , 2.55 ) for PM10 , respectively ; and increase in IQR of air pollutant concentrations associated with respiratory mortality , 2.39 percent ( 95% CI : 0.68 , 4.09 ) for CO , 1.79 percent ( 95% CI : 0.11 , 3.47 ) for NO2 and 2.07 percent ( 95% CI : 0.21 , 3.92 ) for PM10 , respectively .
We used the principal component analysis to avoid collinearity of varied air pollutants .
In addition , the association stratified by sex and age was also examined .
Ambient air pollution remained a significant contributor to nonaccidental and cardiopulmonary mortalities in Beijing during 2009,2010 .
