A pilot study was carried out in Tuscany , Italy , to provide preliminary information on the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls ( DL-PCBs ) , and selected non-dioxin-like PCBs ( NDL-PCBs ) in groups of subjects living in the vicinity of two incineration plants .
Seventy-four volunteers were enrolled from areas identified as under a potential impact from incinerator emissions and from not exposed areas .
No significant differences were observed between subjects living in the two types of areas .
Total concentrations of PCDDs , PCDFs , and DL-PCBs resulted to be in the range 23-30 pg WHO-TEQ g(-1) , lipid base , for subjects in the 27-54 year age groups , while concentrations increased to 40-44 pgTEQ g(-1) for the two 55-67 year age groups .
The levels of PCDDs and PCDFs were in good agreement with those observed for unexposed population groups in Italy , while the contribution to total TEQ from DL-PCBs was appreciably higher than those currently observed in the general population in Italy and other countries .
As to NDL-PCBs , serum levels of the six " indicator " congeners were in the range 240-300 ng g(-1) , lipid base , for subjects in the 27-54 year age groups .
A raise in NDL-PCB body burden ( 430-470 ng g(-1) , lipid base ) was observed for the two 55+ year age groups , in agreement with the expected age-dependent increase .
The findings from this study do not show an incremental exposure to PCDDs and PCDFs in the samples from subjects living around the two incineration plants , whereas PCB congener profiles in all samples suggest a possible impact on the area of interest of industrial activities from near industrial settlements .
