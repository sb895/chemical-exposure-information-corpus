Diatomaceous earth is a noncrystalline form of silica ; in processing , calcining leads to formation of cristobalite , a form of crystalline silica .
Four hundred ninety-two currently employed diatomaceous earth workers in a large mine and processing facility had chest radiographs performed and interpreted by the International Labour Office ( ILO ) system .
Two hundred sixty-seven subjects underwent spirometry testing .
Exposure indices for total dust ( largely diatomaceous earth ) and cristobalite were reconstructed for each individual based upon personnel records .
Analysis demonstrated the following prevalences of radiographic findings : 5% had ILO scores > or = 1/0 , and 25% had scores of 0/1 or higher .
Regression analyses showed that there was a relationship between both total cristobalite exposure and total dust ( largely diatomaceous earth ) exposure and the ILO score .
Radiographic patterns are not typical of those of classic silicosis .
Linear regression analyses for forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) , forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , and FEV1/FVC ratio did not demonstrate a relationship between cumulative exposure and lung function .
Such analyses were performed using all subjects and stratified by smoking status .
There were differences in spirometric data according to radiographic ILO category , but the results were inconsistent and did not permit determining if physiologic changes are associated with radiographic change or if this is due to confounding .
Overall , the study suggests that diatomaceous earth pneumoconiosis ( radiographically defined ) is an entity distinct from silicosis .
Recent exposure levels may produce radiographic abnormalities but do not lead to demonstrable physiologic effect .
The prevalence of the disorder has diminished markedly in response to modern dust control measures .
Ongoing medical surveillance is recommended in workers with potential exposure to significant quantity of material .
