Studies show higher house dust dust and body burden levels of PBDE flame retardants in North America than Europe ; but little is known about exposure variation within North America , where California's furniture flammability standard affects PBDE use .
We compared dust dust samples from 49 homes in two California communities with 120 Massachusetts homes and with other published studies .
Dust Dust concentrations [ median ( range ) ng/g ] in California homes of BDE-47 , -99 , and -100 were 2700 ( 112-107,000 ) , 3800 ( 102-170,000 ) , and 684 ( <MRL-30,900 ) , respectively , and were 4-10 times higher than previously reported in North America .
Maximum concentrations were the highest ever reported in indoor dust .
We then investigated whether human serum PBDE levels were also higher in California compared to other North American regions by analyzing the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) , the only data set available with serum from a representative sample of the U.S. population ( n=2040 ) .
California residence was significantly associated with nearly 2-fold higher sigma PBDE serum levels [ least square geometric mean ( LSGM ) ng/g lipid , 73.0 vs 38.5 ( p = 0.002) ] .
Elevated PBDE exposures in California may result from the state's furniture flammability standards ; our results suggest the need for further research in a larger representative sample .
