Human biomonitoring is an important indicator and measure of exposure to environmental chemicals and provides information to support health protection policies and programs .
Cycle 1 ( 2007-2009 ) of the Canadian Health Measures Survey ( CHMS ) collected and analyzed biological samples from over 5600 males and females aged 6-79 years , which established national representative blood and urine concentrations for a number of environmental chemicals including metals , organophosphate insecticide metabolites , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , organochlorines ( OCs ) , perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) , bisphenol A ( BPA ) , and cotinine .
The results of CHMS Cycle 1 indicate that while some organophosphate insecticide metabolites were below limits of detection for most participants , metals , PCBs , OCs , PFCs and BPA were detected in almost all blood or urine samples .
Significant differences ( p<0.05 ) in blood concentrations between males and females were also determined for several metals ( e.g. , lead for males and females was 15.1 and 11.8 \u03bcg/L , respectively ) , PFCs ( e.g. , PFOS for males and females was 11.13 and 7.07 \u03bcg/L , respectively ) , and OCs ( e.g. , p,p'-DDE for males and females was 134.43 and 172.07 \u03bcg/kg lipid , respectively ) and in urine concentrations for BPA ( 1.29 and 1.04 \u03bcg/L for males and females , respectively ) .
Future cycles of the CHMS will permit temporal trend analysis for a number of these chemicals .
