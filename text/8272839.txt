Milk from the Mothers ' Milk Centre in Stockholm has been analysed for organochlorine contaminants in different time periods between 1967 and 1989 .
The contemporary investigations showed a decrease of the levels of certain pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .
The changes were related to the prohibitions and restrictions applied on the usage of the compounds .
Milk samples , remaining from the contemporary studies , were archived from 1972 and onward .
These samples were later reanalyzed and the investigations were extended to also include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and specific congeners of PCBs , including non-ortho and mono-ortho coplanar PCBs .
These retrospective investigations , of the same milk , showed a time related decrease in the concentrations also for these compounds .
Calculating the levels by toxic equivalency factors relative to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) it was found that PCBs contributed the major part of the toxic equivalents in milk .
