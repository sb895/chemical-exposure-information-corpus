A prospective birth cohort of 1022 participants was established in the Faroe Islands over a 21-month period during 1986-1987 .
We collected questionnaire data on potential persistent organic pollutant ( POP ) concentration predictors , such as duration of breastfeeding and blubber consumption .
To assess the participants ' exposure from in utero to 14 years of age to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and the insecticide p,p'-DDT and its primary degradate p,p'-DDE , we measured 37 PCB congeners and pesticides in 316 umbilical cord samples taken from participants at birth , in 124 serum samples collected from participants at approximately 7 years of age , and in 795 serum samples collected from participants at 14 years of age .
Measurements of higher chlorination PCB congeners made on individuals ' serum samples collected at 7 years and 14 years were highly correlated ( typically r > 0.5 , p > 0.01 ) , although their concentrations at 7 years were generally two to three times higher than at 14 years .
Similarly , umbilical cord PCB concentrations were correlated with PCB concentrations in both 7- and 14-year serum samples .
Sex-specific differences in higher chlorination PCB and p,p'-DDE concentrations were found at 14 years but not at 7 years , although a sex interaction with blubber consumption and nursing duration was observed at both ages .
Both duration of breastfeeding and consumption of blubber were significant predictors of serum summationPCB concentrations at 7 and 14 years .
Multivariate analyses showed that breastfeeding duration was the primary contributor to serum summationPCB concentrations at 7 years , and blubber consumption was the primary contributor at 14 years .
These data suggest that infant exposures from breastfeeding were sufficiently large so that continued exposures to PCBs , p,p'-DDT , and p,p'-DDE through the diet have not fully diluted their contribution to the summationPCB and p,p'-DDE body burden of the children .
