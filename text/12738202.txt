There is a lack of data on environmental benzene exposure in children .
In this study , we compared personal benzene exposure and inhalation uptake in a group of children to those of their parents .
We also compared levels of urinary benzene metabolites , trans,trans-muconic acid ( MA ) and hydroquinone ( HQ ) , for those two groups , and assessed the correlation between personal benzene exposure and urinary MA and HQ concentrations .
The study was performed on 21 , 2-3-year-old children and their parents recruited on a voluntary basis among non-smokers from the three largest day-care centers of the town of Rouen in France .
Average benzene concentrations were measured over 5 consecutive days with diffusive samplers .
The following simultaneous measurements were carried out : personal exposure of the parents , concentrations inside and outside the day care centers , and inside the volunteer's bedrooms .
Morning and evening urine samples were collected during the same period .
Benzene personal exposure levels were 14.4+/-7.7 microg/m(3) and 11.09+/-6.15 microg/m(3) in parents and children , respectively .
Benzene inhalation uptake estimates were 2.51+/-1.23 microg/kg/day in the group of parents and 5.68+/-3.17 microg/kg/day in the group of children .
Detectable levels of MA and HQ were found in 85% and 100% of the samples , respectively .
Intra-individual variation of urinary MA and HQ concentrations expressed as a coefficient of variation ( CV ) ranged from 63 to 232% and from 13 to 144% , respectively .
Mean values of MA and HQ ( in mg/g creatinine ) were 1.6- and 1.8-fold higher in the group of children than in the group of parents ( P=0.008 and P<0.0001 , respectively ) .
Significant correlations between metabolites levels and benzene were not found .
