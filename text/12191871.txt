In the present study , the personal exposure to mancozeb and/or ethilenethiourea ( ETU ) in 13 Italian vineyard workers and in 13 subjects without occupational exposure to pesticides was investigated .
With this aim , the level of ETU in urine and the dermal exposure to mancozeb were determined .
Baseline urinary ETU results were lower than the analytical limit of detection for all controls ( <0.5 microg/g creatinine ) and for ten workers ( median <0.5 , range <0.5-3.4 microg/g creatinine ) .
In workers , urinary ETU was significantly increased at the end of shift ( 2.5 , <0.5-95.2 microg/g creatinine ) compared with baseline levels .
End-shift urinary ETU was higher in operators using open tractors ( n=7 ) than in those using closed tractors ( n=5 ) ( 16.2 vs. 2.4 microg/g creatinine ) , but the difference was not significant ( P=0.073 ) .
End-shift urinary ETU was positively correlated with dermal exposure to mancozeb determined both over the clothes and on the skin ( Spearman's rho=0.770 and 0.702 , P=0.009 and 0.024 , respectively ) .
Wine consumption positively influenced the excretion of ETU .
