Mercury is a persistent environmental pollutant that has the potential to adversely affect human health , particularly , foetal neurodevelopment .
The purpose of the study was to investigate prenatal mercury ( Hg ) exposure in the population in three sites along the South Africa coast .
Study subjects included women ( n=350 ) who were admitted for delivery at the local hospitals .
Maternal and cord blood samples were collected to measure total mercury and each participant was required to answer a questionnaire .
The 90th percentile of mercury levels in maternal and cord blood of the total population was 1.15 \u03bcg/l and 1.67 \u03bcg/l , respectively .
Site 1 ( Manguzi ) participants had the highest maternal geometric mean ( GM ) values of 0.93 \u03bcg/l , which was significantly different from Site 2 ( Port Shepstone ) ( 0.49 \u03bcg/l ) and Site 3 ( Empangeni ) ( 0.56 \u03bcg/l ) ( ANOVA test , p<0.001 ) .
Umbilical cord blood GM Hg level for Site 1 ( 1.45 \u03bcg/l ) was more than double the GM Hg level in Site 2 ( 0.70 \u03bcg/l ) and Site 3 ( 0.73 \u03bcg/l ) .
Univariate analysis indicated that the following maternal characteristics were positive predictors for elevated umbilical cord Hg levels : maternal blood Hg levels , living with a partner , residing in Site 1 , living in informal housing , using wood and gas for cooking , borehole water as a drinking source , and a member of the household being involved in fishing .
Maternal dietary predictors of elevated Hg levels in umbilical cord blood included consuming fresh fish , tinned fish , fruit or dairy products , daily .
This study provides baseline data and reveals that 2% of the study population were above the EPA's reference value ( 5.8 \u03bcg/l ) suggesting low level exposure to mercury in pregnant women and the developing foetus in South Africa .
Further research is required to explore the sources of elevated Hg levels in Site 1 .
