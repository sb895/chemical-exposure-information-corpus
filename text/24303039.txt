BACKGROUND In a previous study , we showed that individuals who had participated in oil clean-up tasks after the wreckage of the Prestige presented an increase of structural chromosomal alterations two years after the acute exposure had occurred .
Other studies have also reported the presence of DNA damage during acute oil exposure , but little is known about the long term persistence of chromosomal alterations , which can be considered as a marker of cancer risk .
OBJECTIVES We analyzed whether the breakpoints involved in chromosomal damage can help to assess the risk of cancer as well as to investigate their possible association with DNA repair efficiency .
METHODS Cytogenetic analyses were carried out on the same individuals of our previous study and DNA repair errors were assessed in cultures with aphidicolin .
RESULTS Three chromosomal bands , 2q21 , 3q27 and 5q31 , were most affected by acute oil exposure .
The dysfunction in DNA repair mechanisms , expressed as chromosomal damage , was significantly higher in exposed-oil participants than in those not exposed ( p= 0.016 ) .
CONCLUSION The present study shows that breaks in 2q21 , 3q27 and 5q31 chromosomal bands , which are commonly involved in hematological cancer , could be considered useful genotoxic oil biomarkers .
Moreover , breakages in these bands could induce chromosomal instability , which can explain the increased risk of cancer ( leukemia and lymphomas ) reported in chronically benzene-exposed individuals .
In addition , it has been determined that the individuals who participated in clean-up of the oil spill presented an alteration of their DNA repair mechanisms two years after exposure .
