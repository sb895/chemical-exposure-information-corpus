Background exposures provide perspective for interpreting calculated health risks associated with naturally occurring substances such as arsenic .
Background inorganic arsenic intake from diet and water for children ( ages 1-6 years ) and all ages of the U.S. population was modeled stochastically using consumption data from USDA , published data on inorganic arsenic in foods , and EPA data on arsenic in drinking water .
Mean and 90th percentile intakes for the U.S. population were 5.6 and 10.5 microg/day , assuming nationwide compliance with the 10 microg/L U.S. drinking water standard .
Intakes for children were slightly lower ( 3.5 and 5.9 microg/day ) .
Based on the current EPA cancer slope factor for arsenic , estimated lifetime risks associated with background diet and water at the mean and 90th percentile are 1 per 10,000 and 2 per 10,000 , respectively .
By comparison , reasonable maximum risks for arsenic in soil at 20 ( higher typical background level ) and 100mg/kg are 4 per 100,000 and 2 per 10,000 , using EPA default exposure assumptions .
EPA reasonable maximum estimates of arsenic exposure from residential use of treated wood are likewise within background intakes .
These examples provide context on how predicted risks compare to typical exposures within the U.S. population , thereby providing perspective for risk communication and regulatory decision-making on arsenic in the environment and in consumer products .
