There is no previous report from Turkey on chemically determined polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in human tissues expressed as World Health Organization ( WHO ) toxic equivalents ( TEQs ) .
The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of PCDDs/Fs , and dioxin-like PCBs in the general adult Turkish population .
For this reason we measured adipose tissue concentrations of PCDDs/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in 23 Turkish men living in Ankara,Turkey in 2004 .
PCDD/F concentrations ranged between 3.2 and 19.7 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ( 5.34 and 42.7 WHO-TEQ/g fat , respectively , including dioxin-like PCBs ) .
The mean concentrations of WHO(PCDD/F)-TEQ and WHO(PCB)-TEQ were 9.2 and 6.67 pg/g on a lipid basis , respectively .
Samples were analyzed for PCDD/F and twelve dioxin-like PCB congeners using high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry ( HRGC/HRMS ) .
This study is very important since it is the first report on PCDDs/Fs and dioxin-like PCB contamination in human adipose tissue from Turkey .
