BACKGROUND Exposure to arsenic through drinking water has been associated with impaired cognitive function in school-aged children in a few cross-sectional studies ; however , there is little information on critical windows of exposure .
METHODS We conducted a population-based longitudinal study in rural Bangladesh .
We assessed the association of arsenic exposure , based on urinary arsenic ( U-As ; twice during pregnancy and twice in childhood ) , with the development of about 1700 children at 5 years of age using Wechsler Pre-school and Primary Scale of Intelligence [ intelligence quotient ( IQ) ] .
RESULTS Median maternal U-As in pregnancy was 80 µg/l ( 10-90 percentiles : 25-400 µg/l ) .
Children's urine contained 35 ( 12-155 ) µg/l and 51 ( 20-238 ) µg/l at 1.5 and 5 years , respectively .
Using multivariable-adjusted regression analyses , controlling for all potential confounders and loss to follow-up , we found that verbal IQ ( VIQ ) and full scale IQ ( FSIQ ) were negatively associated with ( log ) U-As in girls .
The associations were consistent , but somewhat stronger with concurrent arsenic exposure [ VIQ : B = -2.4 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = -3.8 to -1.1 ; FSIQ : B = -1.4 , 95% CI = -2.7 to -0.1 , n = 817 ) , compared with that at 1.5 years ( VIQ : B = -0.85 , 95% CI = -2.1 to 0.4 ; FSIQ : B = -0.74 , 95% CI = -1.9 to 0.4 , n = 902 ) , late gestation ( VIQ : B = -1.52 , 95% CI = -2.6 to -0.4 ; FSIQ : B = -1.35 , 95% CI = -2.4 to -0.3 , n = 874 ) and early gestation ( VIQ : B = -1.23 , 95% CI = -2.4 to -0.06 ; FSIQ : B = -0.92 , 95% CI = -2.0 to -0.2 , n = 833 ) .
In boys , U-As showed consistently low and non-significant associations with all IQ measures .
An effect size calculation indicated that 100 µg/l U-As was associated with a decrement of 1-3 points in both VIQ and FSIQ in girls .
CONCLUSION We found adverse effects of arsenic exposure on IQ in girls , but not boys , at 5 years of age .
