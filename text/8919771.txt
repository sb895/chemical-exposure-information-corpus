A pilot study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of using trans,trans-muconic acid ( MA ) as a biomarker of environmental benzene exposure .
A secondary aim was to provide data on the extent of exposure to selected toxicants in a unique population consisting of inner-city children who were already overexposed to one urban hazard , lead .
Potential sources of benzene were assessed by a questionnaire .
Exposure biomarkers included urinary MA and cotinine and blood lead .
Mean MA was 176.6 +/- 341.7 ng/mg creatinine in the 79 children who participated .
A wide range of values was found with as many as 10.1% , depending on the comparison study , above the highest levels reported in adults not exposed by occupation .
Mean MA was increased in children evaluated in the afternoon compared to morning , those at or above the median for time spent playing near the street , and those studied in the first half of the investigation .
MA levels were not associated with blood lead or , consistently , with either questionnaire environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) data or cotinine .
As expected , the mean blood lead level was elevated ( 23.6 micrograms/dl ) .
Mean cotinine was also increased at 79.2 ng/mg creatinine .
We conclude that the use of MA as a biomarker for environmental benzene exposure is feasible since it was detectable in 72% of subjects with a wide range of values present .
In future studies , correlation of MA with personal air sampling in environmental exposure will be essential to fully interpret the significance of these findings .
In addition , these inner-city children comprise a high risk group for exposure to environmental toxicants including ETS , lead , and probably benzene , based on questionnaire sources and its presence in ETS .
