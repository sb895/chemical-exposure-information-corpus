OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to describe the distribution and predictors of blood mercury levels in an adult population .
METHODS This was a cross-sectional analysis of first-visit data ( 2001-2002 ) on a random sample of 474 subjects from the Baltimore Memory Study .
RESULTS After adjustment for race/ethnicity , education , assets , and diabetes , persons in the highest quartile of fish consumption had median mercury levels 1.82 times above the levels in the lowest quartile , while those in the highest education category had median mercury levels 1.57 times higher than levels in the lowest category .
Nine percent of subjects were above the reference dose recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency , which is high compared with that found by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in women of childbearing age .
CONCLUSIONS These findings offer guidance for targeted education and possible new insights regarding the kinetics of mercury .
