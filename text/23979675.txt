Sweet potatoes are a staple in the diet of some people and an excellent source of minerals .
Metal monitoring in food , like sweet potatoes , provides basic information on safety aspects in regulatory processes as well as nutritional values .
One hundred five samples of three varieties of sweet potatoes were randomly obtained from supermarkets , farmers markets , and farmers ' plots in Tenerife ( Canary Islands , Spain ) .
The edible portion ( pulp ) was the only part considered for analysis .
Flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine the contents of sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , calcium ( Ca ) , magnesium ( Mg ) , copper ( Cu ) , iron ( Fe ) , manganese ( Mn ) , and zinc ( Zn ) , while the levels of chromium ( Cr ) , nickel ( Ni ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , and lead ( Pb ) were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry .
The mean concentrations were 500 Na , 4409 K , 564 Ca , 609Mg , 1.291 Cu , 6.554 Fe , 2.324 Mn , 2.348 Zn , 0.028 Cr , 0.048 Ni , 0.001 Cd , and 0.003 Pbmg/kg , respectively .
Potassium presented the highest contents in all varieties of sweet potatoes .
Iron was the most abundant microelement .
The orange fleshed sweet potato variety offered greater nutritional contributions to the recommended intakes than the rest of the varieties studied .
The estimated mean daily intake of Ni ( 0.72mg/day ) detected in our samples was highly consistent with other studies .
Average daily intakes of Cd ( 0.015\u03bcg/day ) and Pb ( 0.045\u03bcg/day ) were below toxicological reference values .
In conclusion , the levels of Cd and Pb detected in the sweet potatoes analyzed do not represent any toxicological risk to consumers .
