Edible marine species ( fish , cephalopod molluscs , crustaceans ) from the Adriatic Sea were analyzed for content in heavy metals ( Hg , Cd and Pb ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .
Health risks to human via dietary intake of seafood were assessed by the target hazard quotients ( THQs ) and the toxic equivalent factors ( TEFs ) .
Mercury maximum concentrations corresponded to fish ( 0.07-1.56 microg g(-1)w.w. ) , followed by cephalopod molluscs ( 0.10-0.55 microg g(-1)w.w. ) , and crustaceans ( 0.27-0.33 microg g(-1)w.w. ) .
Cadmium levels in cephalopods ( 0.18-0.59 microg g(-1)w.w. ) were higher than those in fish ( 0.01-0.05 microg g(-1)w.w. ) and crustaceans ( 0.02-0.04 microg g(-1)w.w. ) , while for Pb the concentrations were generally low ( fish : ND-1.18 microg g(-1)w.w. , cephalopods : ND-0.17 microg g(-1)w.w. , crustaceans : ND-0.03 microg g(-1)w.w. ) .
For PCBs , concentrations in fish , cephalopods and crustaceans ranged between 141 and 3,406 ng g(-1)l.w. , 190 and 542 ng g(-1)l.w. , and 202 and 429 ng g(-1)l.w. , respectively .
Cd and Pb THQ values as well as estimates of PCB TEQ exposure indicated the absence of health risks through consumption of the various seafood .
In contrast , mercury TEQs values due to consumption of certain fish species ( albacore , rosefish and thornback ray ) indicated that human health risk might be of concern .
