OBJECTIVE This study quantified casino dealers ' occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) .
METHODS We measured casino dealers ' exposure to ETS components by analyzing full-shift air and preshift and postshift urine samples .
RESULTS Casino dealers were exposed to nicotine , 4-vinyl pyridine , benzene , toluene , naphthalene , formaldehyde , acetaldehyde , solanesol , and respirable suspended particulates .
Levels of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol ( NNAL ) in urine increased significantly during an 8-hour work shift both with and without adjustment for creatinine clearance .
Creatinine-unadjusted cotinine significantly increased during the 8-hour shift , but creatinine-adjusted cotinine did not increase significantly .
CONCLUSIONS Casino dealers at the three casinos were exposed to airborne ETS components and absorbed an ETS-specific component into their bodies , as demonstrated by detectable levels of urinary NNAL .
The casinos should ban smoking on their premises and offer employee smoking cessation programs .
