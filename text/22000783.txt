Birth weight is a strong determinant of attained weight at early ages .
Until now , many studies have reported that low birth weight corresponds with high mercury levels .
However , the relationship between mercury exposure and attained weight of infant has not been well studied .
Therefore , the aim of the present study was to assess the degree of prenatal exposure to mercury by measuring the total mercury levels in maternal and cord blood , and examine the relationship between the mercury level during pregnancy and the attained weight of infant during the first 24 months of life .
The prospective cohort study of Mothers and Children's Environmental Health ( MOCEH ) was built up in 2006 , and 921 mother-infant pairs were recruited .
Information on the socio-demographic characteristics , health behavior and environmental exposure were collected from an interview with trained nurses .
After delivery , infants and mothers were followed up at 6 , 12 and 24 months and the weights of the infants were measured .
The mercury concentrations in the late maternal blood ( \u03b2=-0.19. p=0.05 ) and cord blood ( \u03b2=-0.36. p=0.01 ) were negatively associated with the infants ' attained weight over the first 24 months of age .
The infants ' attained weight in the small for their gestational age ( SGA ) group was lower than the normal birth weight group at the highest quartile of the mercury level .
Therefore , efforts should be made to reduce the mercury level in the maternal blood at late pregnancy and cord blood .
Further research on the possible harmful effects of prenatal mercury exposure on postnatal growth is recommended .
