The German Environmental Survey for Children ( GerES IV ) is the environment-related module of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents ( KiGGS ) of the Robert Koch Institute and the fourth GerES of the Federal Environment Agency .
The main objective of GerESs is to analyse and document the extent , distribution and determinants of exposure to environmental pollutants of the German general population .
GerES IV was performed from 2003 to 2006 .
A total of 1.790 children aged 3-14 years from 150 sampling locations participated in GerES IV .
Samples of blood , urine , tap water , house dust and indoor air were analysed .
Hearing tests , measurements of traffic noise and interviews to get exposure-related information were conducted .
First results indicate a clear decrease of the exposure to arsenic , lead and mercury .
Cotinine concentrations in urine can be used to classify the exposure of children to environmental tobacco smoke .
The examination of the tap water used in the subjects ' households indicates that in some households the guideline values of the German Drinking Water Ordinance were not always met .
This is the case for nickel , copper and lead which are used as pipe material for domestic plumbing .
