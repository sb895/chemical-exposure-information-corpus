We propose that in utero exposure to tobacco smoke products places a newborn at risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( PPHN ) .
To test this hypothesis , infants with PPHN were identified .
Healthy newborns of similar ethnicity were identified as a comparison group .
Cord blood cotinine concentrations and maternal questionnaires were obtained .
The number of women exposed to tobacco smoke in each group ascertained by questionnaire was borderline significantly different ( 38.7% vs. 20.5% ; p = 0.080 ) .
However , more PPHN infants had detectable cotinine in their cord blood ( 64.5% vs. 28.2% ; p = 0.002 ) , and the median cotinine concentrations were significantly higher ( 5.2 ng/ml vs. 2 ng/ml ; p = 0.051 ) than the comparison infants .
Among infants delivered to nonsmoking women , more PPHN infants had detectable cotinine ( 50% vs. 19% ; p = 0.015 ) , and the cotinine concentrations were higher ( 3.5 ng/ml vs. 1.65 ng/ml ; p = 0.022 ) than the comparison group .
We conclude that active and passive smoking during pregnancy is a risk factor for PPHN .
Therefore , we recommend that pregnant women cease smoking and avoid environmental tobacco smoke .
