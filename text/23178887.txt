Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) were determined in commonly consumed seafood and house dust collected from Korea .
Total concentrations of PBDEs in seafood and house dust samples were in the ranges of 0.06 to 6.25 ng/g wet weight and 80 to 16,000 ng/g dry weight , respectively .
Predominant congeners in seafood were BDEs 47 , 99 and 100 and those in dust samples were BDE 209 .
Estimated daily intakes ( EDIs ) of PBDEs through seafood consumption and dust ingestion for adults ( >20 years ) and toddlers ( <2 years ) were 1.83 and 11.4 ng/kg body weight/day , respectively .
In comparison with the EDIs reported for PBDEs by general population in several countries , the contribution of seafood consumption to PBDE intake in Korea was the highest .
Seafood consumption and dust ingestion contributed equally to the total PBDE intakes in Korean adults , while dust ingestion was the major contributor to toddlers .
This study was the first to assess exposure of humans to PBDEs through two major exposure pathways .
