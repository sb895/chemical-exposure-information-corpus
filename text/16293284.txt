To assess how the human exposure to airborne carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) during working in or visiting a typical Taiwanese temple , we present a probabilistic risk model , appraised with reported empirical data .
Two approaches are applied , one based on animal-derived benzo[a]pyrene ( B[a]P ) toxic equivalents ( B[a]P(eq) ) of individual PAHs and one is assumed that the potency of PAH mixtures is linked to their B[a]P level .
The model integrates probabilistic exposure profiles of total-PAH and particle-bound PAH levels inside a temple from a published exploratory study with probabilistic incremental lifetime cancer risk ( ILCR ) models taking into account inhalation and dermal contact pathways , to quantitatively estimate the exposure risks for three age groups of adult , adolescent , and child .
Risk analysis indicates that 90% probability inhalation ILCRs for three age groups have orders of magnitude around 10(-7)--10(-6) ; whereas for the dermal contact ILCRs ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-4) , indicating high potential cancer risk .
All 90% probabilities of B[a]P- and B[a]P(eq)-based total ILCRs are larger than 10(-6) , indicating unacceptable probability distributions for three age groups .
Sensitivity analysis indicates that to increase the accuracy of the results efforts should focus on a better definition of probability distributions for inhalation cancer slope factor , inhalation rates , and particle-bound PAH-to-skin adherence factor .
We estimate risk-based visiting frequency advice for adult , adolescent , and child to a temple ranging from 5 to 7 , 17 to 23 , and 48 to 65 year(-1) , respectively , based on an average 3h residence time .
