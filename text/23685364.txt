Breast milk samples of 39 first time mothers aged 20-30 were collected in 2007-2010 from rural and urban areas of New Zealand , following the fourth World Health Organization coordinated survey protocol .
Samples were individually analysed for persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) including dioxins and furans ( PCDD/Fs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) .
The lipid adjusted concentrations of PCDD/Fs ( mean toxic equivalent ( TEQ ) : 3.54 pg/g ) and PCBs ( mean TEQ 1.29 pg/g ) were low in comparison to those reported for other countries , and concentrations of dieldrin ( 10 ng/g ) and p,p'-DDE ( 379 ng/g ) and PBDEs were in the mid-range .
Breast milk concentrations of PCDD/F-TEQ , PCB-TEQ , dieldrin and p,p'-DDE were significantly higher in rural compared to urban areas ( +23% , 33% , 59% , and 44% respectively ) , while concentrations of several PBDEs and lindane were higher in urban areas .
Concentrations of PCDD/Fs , PCBs and OCPs , but not PBDEs , increased with age , and higher body mass index was associated with lower concentrations of PCBs .
Despite New Zealand's low body burdens of many chlorinated POPs in comparison to other countries , breast milk concentrations continued to decrease over time , with a decrease by half over the last 10 years for PCDD/F-TEQ ( -40% ) , PCB-TEQ ( -54% ) and OCPs -34 to -90% ) , indicating that regulatory measures continue to have beneficial effects .
Continued monitoring is needed particularly for the brominated POPs for which little New Zealand specific data is available .
