Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are persistent pollutants that are ubiquitous in the food chain , and detectable amounts are in the blood of almost every person in most populations that have been examined .
Extensive evidence from animal studies shows that PCBs are neurotoxins , even at low doses .
Interpretation of human data regarding low-level , early-life PCB exposure and subsequent neurodevelopment is problematic because levels of exposure were not similarly quantified across studies .
We expressed the exposure levels from 10 studies of PCB and neurodevelopment in a uniform manner using a combination of data from original investigators , laboratory reanalyses , calculations based on published data , and expert opinion .
The mainstay of our comparison was the median level of PCB 153 in maternal pregnancy serum .
The median concentration of PCB 153 in the 10 studies ranged from 30 to 450 ng/g serum lipid , and the median of the 10 medians was 110 ng/g .
We found that ( a) ) the distribution of PCB 153 exposure in most studies overlapped substantially , ( b) ) exposure levels in the Faroe Islands study were about 3-4-fold higher than in most other studies , and ( c) ) the exposure levels in the two recent U.S. studies were about one-third of those in the four earlier U.S. studies or recent Dutch , German , and northern Qu√©bec studies .
Our results will facilitate a direct comparison of the findings on PCBs and neurodevelopment when they are published for all 10 studies .
