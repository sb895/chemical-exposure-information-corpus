Because crude oil and refined petroleum products can contain benzene and benzene is considered a known carcinogen by numerous independent and governmental agencies , including the International Agency for Cancer Research , the petroleum industry has implemented exposure control programs for decades .
As part of the benzene control programs , significant exposure assessments have been performed ; both qualitatively and through quantitative measurements .
In this study , we evaluated the airborne concentrations of benzene and their variability over time at the ExxonMobil refinery in Beaumont , TX between 1976 and 2007 .
The results of 5854 personal air samples are included in this analysis ; 3761 were considered non-task ( > or =180 min ) personal samples , and 2093 were considered task-related ( <180 min ) personal samples .
Dock and loading rack samples were analyzed separately from the refinery samples because in addition to refinery products , employees at the dock and loading rack also handled chemical plant products .
In general , the non-task personal refinery air samples indicated that exposures of the past 30 years were generally below the occupational exposure limit of 1 ppm ( mean=0.30 ppm , SD=3.1 ) , were higher during routine ( mean=0.32 ppm , SD=3.3 ) than turnaround operations ( mean=0.16 ppm , SD=0.87 ) , and decreased slightly over time .
The job sampled most frequently during routine operations was that of process technician , and , as broken down by area , resulted in the following mean benzene air concentrations : coker ( n=146 , mean=0.014 ppm , SD=0.036 ) , lube extraction unit ( n=31 , mean<0.070 ppm ) , pipestills ( n=136 , mean=0.12 , SD=0.47 ) , waste treatment ( n=107 , mean=0.20 , SD=0.28 ) , and all other areas ( n=1115 , mean=0.059 ppm , SD=0.36 ) .
Task-based samples indicated that the highest exposures resulted from the tank cleaning tasks , although the overall task mean benzene air concentration was 1.4 ppm during routine operations .
The most frequently sampled task during routine operations was blinding and breaking , and the mean benzene air concentrations associated with this task were statistically higher in the reformer area of the refinery ( n=311 , mean=3.2 ppm , SD=7.9 ) than in all other areas ( n=200 , mean=0.92 ppm , SD=3.1 ) .
However , task-related exposures were found to be statistically similar across job categories for a given task .
This study thus provides a task-focused analysis for occupational exposure to benzene during refinery operations , and will be useful for understanding exposures at this refinery .
