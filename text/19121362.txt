Bisphenol-A ( BPA ) , material for polycarbonate and epoxy resin synthesis , has been detected in canned food , among other food containers .
In mammal studies , BPA transferred from mother to fetus , caused abnormality of reproductive organs , and advanced female puberty .
BPA from canned food and microwave containers was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry .
Population was cohort of mother-son pairs established at Granada University Hospital .
Frequency of food consumption ( including canned food ) was studied with a semi-quantitative questionnaire .
The most frequently consumed products were fish and juice cans , consumed 1-3 times/week by 34.7% and 22.3% of the study population , respectively .
The women made little use of polymer microwave containers , 52.8% never using them and 45.9% using them <3 times/month .
Estimated mean ( standard deviation ) intake of BPA was 1.1(0.839) microgram/day .
No relationship was found between BPA exposure and maternal socio-demographic variables or newborn characteristics .
This study offers the first estimate of BPA dietary intake by pregnant women in Southern Spain .
The consumption of canned foods and drinks by these women means that their exposure was lower than EFSA estimates for the European population .
Nevertheless it remains of concern , given the proven undesirable effects of low-level exposure and higher susceptibility of pregnant women .
