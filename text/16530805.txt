We measured organochlorine concentrations of 15 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners and six organochlorine pesticides ( PCB28 , 52 , 101 , 123(+149) , 118 , 114 , 153 , 105 , 138(+163) , 167 , 156(+171) , 157 , 180 , 170 , 189 , alpha- , beta- , gamma-HCH , HCB , p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE ) in 2047 subjects from contaminated and background areas of eastern Slovakia .
Data were collected in 2001 and analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection in 2002-2003 .
Elevated levels persist in subjects from Michalovce district , site of former production facility , after almost 20-years since the end of the PCB manufacturing .
Sum of 15 PCB congeners was 3105 ng/g of lipid in the Michalovce district versus 871 ng/g of lipid for subjects from the background districts of Svidnik and Stropkov .
Relatively high concentration in children from the Michalovce district , sum PCB = 766 ng/g of lipid versus 372 ng/g of lipid in children from background area suggest ongoing exposure from environmental reservoirs and contaminated food .
Consistent differences between genders in both contaminated and background areas are reported here .
Levels in males are about 20% higher in both districts .
Levels of organochlorine pesticides , particularly of DDT metabolite DDE and hexachlorobenzene are also elevated in the Michalovce district , reflecting intensive use of pesticides in agriculture in the past .
About 30% decrease in serum organochlorine levels was observed in comparison with our earlier samples collected in 1998 .
These results suggest that contamination with PCBs still remains a source of relatively high environmental exposure for subjects in the Michalovce district .
