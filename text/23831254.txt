Agricultural work is a major contributor to California's and the nation's economy and employs a large number of workers .
However , agricultural work can have numerous risks , such as exposure to elevated levels of particulate matter ( PM ) and other airborne pollutants with potential adverse health effects .
To determine the magnitude of occupational exposures , PM levels were assessed for 89 workers from three major crops in California ; almonds , melons and tomatoes .
Personal samples were collected for PM2.5 and inhalable PM using personal sampling equipment .
Geometric mean concentrations from personal exposure for workers in almonds ( inhalable PM=4368\u03bcg/m(3) , PM2.5=122\u03bcg/m(3) , N=5 ) , tomatoes ( inhalable PM=1410\u03bcg/m(3) , PM2.5=12\u03bcg/m(3) , N=33 ) , and melons ( inhalable PM=1118\u03bcg/m(3) , PM2.5=19\u03bcg/m(3) , N=51 ) showed high PM exposure when working with these three crops .
Large exposure differences by crop were more common than by task ( i.e. harvesting , packing and weeding ) among the three crops studied .
This is the largest study of agricultural workers engaged in hand harvesting , a significant employer of farm labor , and relatively high levels of exposure to PM were measured .
