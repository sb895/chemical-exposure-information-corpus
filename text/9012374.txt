Arsenic residues in the communities surrounding former smelters remain a public health concern , especially for infants and children .
To evaluate environmental exposure among these children , a population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the vicinity of a former copper smelter in Anaconda , Montana .
A total of 414 children less than 72 months old were recruited .
First morning voided urine samples and environmental samples were collected for arsenic measurements .
The geometric mean of speciated urinary arsenic was 8.6 microg/liter ( GSD = 1.7 , N = 289 ) .
Average arsenic levels of different types of soil ranged from 121 to 236 microg/g and were significantly related to proximity and wind direction to the smelter site .
The same significant relationship was observed for interior dust arsenic .
Speciated urinary arsenic was found to be significantly related to soil arsenic in bare areas in residential yards ( P < 0.0005 ) .
In general , elevated excretion of arsenic was demonstrable and warranted parents ' attention to reduce exposure of their children to environmental arsenic .
