Human hair is frequently used as a bioindicator of mercury exposure .
We have used X-ray absorption spectroscopy to examine the chemical forms of mercury in human hair samples taken from individuals with high fish consumption and concomitant exposure to methylmercury .
The mercury is found to be predominantly methylmercury-cysteine or closely related species , comprising approximately 80% of the total mercury , with the remainder an inorganic thiolate-coordinated mercuric species .
No appreciable role was found for selenium in coordinating mercury in hair .
