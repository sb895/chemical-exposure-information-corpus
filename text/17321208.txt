The Integrated Exposure Assessment Survey ( INES ) was started in the year 2005 .
Altogether 50 healthy adults living in Bavaria , Germany , were included into the study .
Monitoring was conducted in accordance with relevant routes of human exposure ( inhalation , ingestion ) and integrated different pathways ( indoor air , food , house dust ) .
This approach consisted of a combination of external measurements of contaminants with the determination of these substances or their metabolites in body fluids .
The target substances were phthalates , perfluorinated compounds ( PFC ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and polybrominated diphenylethers ( PBDEs ) .
This paper gives a brief description of the objectives and the concept of INES as well as methods of sampling and analyses of target compounds .
Some preliminary results of biomonitoring data for PFC and phthalates as well as of the dietary intake of DEHP will be discussed .
