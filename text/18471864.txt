The blood serum of cacao farmers and their domestic water sources were analyzed for insecticide residues in selected cacao growing communities of Southwestern Nigeria .
The farmers were grouped into five exposure periods based on their years of involvement in insecticide application , viz , <5 years , 5-9 years , 10-14 years , 15-19 years and >20 years .
The residue analyses revealed that 42 out of the 76 farmers had residues of diazinon , endosulfan , propoxur and lindane in their blood ; and 47.6% out of these farmers belonged in the >20 years exposure duration period .
About 34% of the farmers had diazinon with a mean concentration of 0.067 mg kg(-1) , 29% endosulfan ( mean=0.033 mg kg(-1) ) , 23% propoxur ( mean=0.095 mg kg(-1) ) , and 17% lindane ( mean=0.080 mg kg(-1) ) in their blood .
The residues of lindane , endosulfan and propoxur in all the exposure duration categories were found to be far below the no observable adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) while diazinon residues detected in the blood serum of the farmers in all the exposure duration categories exceeded the NOAEL of 0.02 mg kg(-1) for the insecticide .
The study also revealed that the sources of drinking water had been contaminated with dazinon and propoxur in some of the farmers ' localities ; and the concentrations of the insecticides exceeded the acceptable daily intake ( ADI ) .
It is concluded that cacao farmers in Southwestern Nigeria may have been occupationally exposed due to insecticide application for mirid control in their cacao plantations ; and the exposure at times is of such magnitude as to be hazardous to the farmers and their respective communities .
