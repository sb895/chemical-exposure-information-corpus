In Brescia a PCB production plant polluted soil and forage of the surrounding fields and caused a significant contamination of meat and milk of the cattle fed with local forage .
This in turn induced elevated blood levels of PCDDs , PCDFs and PCBs in the consumers .
The contamination levels and profiles measured in the perirenal fat , in the liver and in the milk of the overall 28 contaminated bovines are reported .
TEQ levels varied from 30 to 81 pg WHO(2005)-TEQ g(-1) ( 38-103 pg WHO(1997)-TEQ ) for perirenal fat , from 107 to 138 pg WHO(2005)-TEQ g(-1) fat ( 128-168 pg WHO(1997)-TEQ ) for liver and from 45 to 50 pg WHO(2005)-TEQg(-1) fat ( 56-65pg WHO(1997)-TEQ ) for milk ; all these values are roughly tenfold higher than the European limits .
Non-ortho dioxin-like ( dl)PCBs are by far the largest contributors to TEQ and PCDF contribution also largely prevail over PCDD's ; both these features are also present in both the contaminated forages and in the serum of consumers of contaminated food .
The indicator PCB levels are in the following ranges : 226-664 ng g(-1) for perirenal fat ; 929-1822 ng g(-1) fat for liver ; 183-477 ng g(-1) fat for milk ; their level is about 100 times higher than the regional background .
The liver samples displayed an overall TEQ several times higher than the perirenal fat from either the same animal or the same pool of animals ; the increase in liver concentration was significantly higher for PCDD and PCDF congeners than for dlPCBs , and it was maximum for OCCD .
