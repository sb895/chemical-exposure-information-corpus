Nine districts in West Bengal , India , and 42 districts in Bangladesh have arsenic levels in groundwater above the World Health Organization maximum permissible limit of 50 microg/L .
The area and population of the 42 districts in Bangladesh and the 9 districts in West Bengal are 92,106 km(2) and 79.9 million and 38,865 km(2) and 42.7 million , respectively .
In our preliminary study , we have identified 985 arsenic-affected villages in 69 police stations/blocks of nine arsenic-affected districts in West Bengal .
In Bangladesh , we have identified 492 affected villages in 141 police stations/blocks of 42 affected districts .
To date , we have collected 10,991 water samples from 42 arsenic-affected districts in Bangladesh for analysis , 58,166 water samples from nine arsenic-affected districts in West Bengal .
Of the water samples that we analyzed , 59 and 34% , respectively , contained arsenic levels above 50 microg/L .
Thousands of hair , nail , and urine samples from people living in arsenic-affected villages have been analyzed to date ; Bangladesh and West Bengal , 93 and 77% samples , on an average , contained arsenic above the normal/toxic level .
We surveyed 27 of 42 districts in Bangladesh for arsenic patients ; we identified patients with arsenical skin lesions in 25 districts .
In West Bengal , we identified patients with lesions in seven of nine districts .
We examined people from the affected villages at random for arsenical dermatologic features ( 11,180 and 29,035 from Bangladesh and West Bengal , respectively ) ; 24.47 and 15.02% of those examined , respectively , had skin lesions .
After 10 years of study in West Bengal and 5 in Bangladesh , we feel that we have seen only the tip of iceberg .
