Mapping spatial distributions of disease occurrence can serve as a useful tool for identifying exposures of public health concern .
Infant mortality is an important indicator of the health status of a population .
Recent literature suggests that neighborhood deprivation status can modify the effect of air pollution on preterm delivery , a known risk factor for infant mortality .
We investigated the effect of neighborhood social deprivation on the association between exposure to ambient air NO2 and infant mortality in the Lille and Lyon metropolitan areas , north and center of France , respectively , between 2002 and 2009 .
We conducted an ecological study using a neighborhood deprivation index estimated at the French census block from the 2006 census data .
Infant mortality data were collected from local councils and geocoded using the address of residence .
We generated maps using generalized additive models , smoothing on longitude and latitude while adjusting for covariates .
We used permutation tests to examine the overall importance of location in the model and identify areas of increased and decreased risk .
The average death rate was 4.2\u2030 and 4.6\u2030 live births for the Lille and Lyon metropolitan areas during the period .
We found evidence of statistically significant precise clusters of elevated infant mortality for Lille and an east-west gradient of infant mortality risk for Lyon .
Exposure to NO2 did not explain the spatial relationship .
The Lille MA , socioeconomic deprivation index explained the spatial variation observed .
These techniques provide evidence of clusters of significantly elevated infant mortality risk in relation with the neighborhood socioeconomic status .
This method could be used for public policy management to determine priority areas for interventions .
Moreover , taking into account the relationship between social and environmental exposure may help identify areas with cumulative inequalities .
