OBJECTIVE To explore risk factors of the patients with skin lesions from burning high-arsenic-contaminated coal in southern Shanxi Province .
METHODS An epidemiological cross-sectional study was conducted in two villages of Hanbin District , Ankang City , Shanxi Province , where 198 participants were randomly selected .
The parts of factors which were not significantly different were rejected via the single variable analysis and the collinear relationships were removed between the other factors using principal components analysis , and then the major risk factors of the skin lesions from burning high-arsenic-contaminated coal were obtained from stepwise logistic regression .
RESULTS The single variable analysis showed that 11 influential variables were significantly associaed with coal-burning-arsenic-associated skin lesions , while principal component and logistic regression analysis showed that 6 variables could be the principal , which were period of burning arsenic-contaminating coal , ege , the arsenic content in blood , resident duration , the arsenic content in urine and hair , respectively .
CONCLUSION The results suggested that the major risk factors of the skin lesions related to burning coal-contaminating arsenic should be period of burning arsenic-contaminating coal , age , the arsenic content in blood , resident duration , the arsenic content in urine and hair .
