The issue of adverse health effects from dental amalgam and the concurrent low-dose exposure to inorganic mercury have been scrutinized by several Swedish expert groups during the past years .
Only rarely have amalgam fillings in children been related to health effects .
Experimental studies in genetically disposed animals have shown that low doses of inorganic mercury can induce autoimmune glomerulonephritis .
The present case-control study included 31 children with acute glomerulonephritis and 33 with Henoch-Schönlein purpura retrieved from an in-patient register for the period 1973-1992 at the county hospital in Halmstad , Sweden .
The median age was 10 and 9 years , respectively , for the two diagnostic groups .
Dental clinics reported amalgam burden of the patients during the year before the date of diagnosis .
Corresponding data were obtained for three randomly selected controls for each case , drawn from the case records of the same dental clinics , with matching for age and sex .
Odds ratios ( 95% confidence interval ) were 1.42 ( 0.49 , 4.11 ) for Henoch-Schönlein purpura , 0.59 ( 0.25 , 1.38 ) for acute glomerulonephritis and 0.84 ( 0.40 , 1.75 ) for both diseases combined .
The results of this study did not indicate increased disease risk in relation to amalgam burden .
