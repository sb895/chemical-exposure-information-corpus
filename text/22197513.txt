The aim of this study is to evaluate personal exposure to As in urban air in two groups of outdoor workers ( traffic policemen and police drivers ) of a big Italian city through : ( a ) environmental monitoring of As obtained by personal samples and ( b ) biological monitoring of total urinary As .
The possible influence of smoking habit on urinary As was evaluated .
We studied 122 male subjects , all Municipal Police employees : 84 traffic policemen and 38 police drivers exposed to urban pollutants .
Personal exposure to As in air was significantly higher in traffic policemen than in police drivers ( p=0.03 ) .
Mean age , length of service , alcohol drinking habit , number of cigarettes smoked/day and BMI were comparable between the groups of subjects studied .
All subjects were working in the same urban area where they had lived for at least 5 yrs .
Dietary habits and consumption of water from the water supply and/or mineral water were similar in traffic policemen and in police drivers .
The values of total urinary As were significantly higher in traffic policemen ( smokers and non smokers ) than in police drivers ( smokers and non smokers ) ( p=0.02 ) .
In the subgroup of non-smokers the values of total urinary As were significantly higher in traffic policemen than in police drivers ( p=0.03 ) .
In traffic policemen and in police drivers total urinary As values were significantly correlated to the values of As in air ( respectively r=0.9 and r=0.8 , p<0.001 ) .
This is the first research in literature studying the exposure to As in outdoor workers occupationally exposed to urban pollutants , such as traffic policemen and police drivers .
Personal exposure to As in the air , as well as the urinary excretion of As , is significantly higher in traffic policemen compared to drivers .
These results can provide information about exposure to As in streets and in car for other categories of outdoor workers similarly exposed .
