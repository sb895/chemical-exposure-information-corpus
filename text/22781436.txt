Two deterministic models ( US EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs Residential Standard Operating Procedures ( OPP Residential SOPs ) and Draft Protocol for Measuring Children's Non-Occupational Exposure to Pesticides by all Relevant Pathways ( Draft Protocol) ) and four probabilistic models ( CARES(Â®) , Calendex\u2122 , ConsExpo , and SHEDS ) were used to estimate aggregate residential exposures to pesticides .
The route-specific exposure estimates for young children ( 2-5 years ) generated by each model were compared to evaluate data inputs , algorithms , and underlying assumptions .
Three indoor exposure scenarios were considered : crack and crevice , fogger , and flying insect killer .
Dermal exposure estimates from the OPP Residential SOPs and the Draft Protocol were 4.75 and 2.37\u2009mg/kg/day ( crack and crevice scenario ) and 0.73 and 0.36\u2009mg/kg/day ( fogger ) , respectively .
The dermal exposure estimates ( 99th percentile ) for the crack and crevice scenario were 16.52 , 12.82 , 3.57 , and 3.30\u2009mg/kg/day for CARES , Calendex , SHEDS , and ConsExpo , respectively .
Dermal exposure estimates for the fogger scenario from CARES and Calendex ( 1.50 and 1.47\u2009mg/kg/day , respectively ) were slightly higher than those from SHEDS and ConsExpo ( 0.74 and 0.55\u2009mg/kg/day , respectively ) .
The ConsExpo derived non-dietary ingestion estimates ( 99th percentile ) under these two scenarios were higher than those from SHEDS , CARES , and Calendex .
All models produced extremely low exposure estimates for the flying insect killer scenario .
Using similar data inputs , the model estimates by route for these scenarios were consistent and comparable .
Most of the models predicted exposures within a factor of 5 at the 50th and 99th percentiles .
The differences identified are explained by activity assumptions , input distributions , and exposure algorithms .
