We investigated chronic incorporation of metals in individuals from poor families , living in a small , restrict and allegedly contaminated area in SÃ£o Paulo city , the surroundings of the Guarapiranga dam , responsible for water supply to 25% of the city population .
A total of 59 teeth from individuals 7 to 60 years old were collected .
The average concentrations of Pb , Cd , Fe , Zn , Mn , Ni and Cr were determined with an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer .
The concentrations of all metals as function of the individuals ' age exhibited a remarkable similarity : peaks between 7 and 10 years and sharply decreasing at higher ages , which could be attributed to alimentary habits and persistence to metals exposure all along the individuals ' life span .
From all the measured metals , lead and cadmium were a matter of much more concern since their measured values are close to the upper limits of the world wide averages .
