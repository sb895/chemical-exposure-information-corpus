In the present study , we analyze and characterize the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in serum and breast adipose tissue , and measure TH ( total 3,5,5'-triiodothyronine ( tT3 ) and total l-thyroxine ( tT4) ) levels in serum of Japanese women diagnosed with breast cancer ( n = 51 ) to know how PCBs affect thyroid hormone homeostasis .
Concentrations of Sigma(90)OH-PCBs in serum and adipose tissues were 630 pg g(-1) serum wet wt. and 140 pg/ g(-1) lipid wt. , respectively , and the levels of OH-PCBs in adipose tissues were 4-5 times lower than in serum .
The tT3 and tT4 concentrations in serum ( n = 20 ) were 1.3 ng g(-1) serum wet wt. and 62 ng g(-1) serum wet wt. , respectively .
Among all the OH-PCBs , 4'-OH-CB101/120 , 4-OH-CB107/4'-OH-CB108 , 3'-OH-CB138 , 4-OH-CB146 , 3-OH-CB153 , 4'-OH-CB172 , and 4-OH-CB187 were the dominant isomers in serum .
No significant correlation between the concentrations of the TH and OH-PCBs in serum was observed ( p > 0.05 ) .
The results indicated that the relationship between the OH-PCB levels and the thyroid hormone markers was rare .
From analysis of two kinds of human biological samples , it was estimated that OH-PCBs have little effect on thyroid hormone homeostasis .
