Naturally occurring isotopic systems , such as strontium ( Sr ) and lead ( Pb ) , are very useful for characterizing different sources and to produce background information .
Norwegian teeth from the Medieval era have 206Pb/204Pb ratios between 18.8 and 18.2 , in comparison with present day ratios of between 18.0 and 17.6 showing the impact of Pb from modern industrialization and from traffic .
Sr analyses of Medieval teeth show that an individual living in a coastal town on the west coast of Norway can easily be distinguished from one in a rural area at that time .
The Sr signature shows that Medieval people lived on local products while present people to a greater degree live on imported or domestic industrially processed food .
Medieval and modern teeth from one site give similar Pb signatures and concentrations indicating no increase in pollution over time .
However , the impact of industrial pollution can be seen from Pb analyses on contemporary teeth , so that the method can be used to monitor emission of heavy metals from local industry .
Whilst the Pb and Sr natural isotopic systems individually provide valuable information , a combination of the two techniques is a very powerful tool in environmental and archaeological research .
