In 1996 , peripheral blood samples and 24-h food duplicate samples together with samples of wheat , rice , foxtail millet and maize were collected from 50 non-smoking women each from Jinan ( a provincial capital ) and Baiquan ( a nearby basically self-sustaining farming village ) in China .
The samples were analyzed for cadmium ( Cd ) contents by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry after wet digestion .
The dietary Cd intake of the people in the city was 6.4 micrograms/day as a geometric mean ( GM ) and 5.9 micrograms/day for the villagers .
The Cd level in blood was 0.48 and 0.29micrograms/l ( as GMs ) for the city and village people , respectively .
Thus , Cd burden of the people in the city tended to be greater than that for those in the village .
Nevertheless , the Cd burden of the Jinan citizens was lower than the values published for people in large cities in China .
When Cd intake via the four cereals was compared with Cd in total food to estimate the total contribution of the four cereals ( combined ) in total dietary Cd intake , the cereals accounted for 60% of total dietary Cd intake among the city people and as high as 78% among the villagers .
Cadmium contents in the four cereals were in a narrow range and it was considered acceptable to combine all cereals in evaluating them as dietary Cd sources .
