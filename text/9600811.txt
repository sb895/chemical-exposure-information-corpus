Color vision was evaluated in twenty-one mercury exposed workers and referents matched for sex , age , tobacco smoking , and alcohol habits .
The Lanthony 15 Hue desaturated panel ( D-15 d ) was applied .
In the workers , mean urinary Hg ( HgU ) was 115+/-61.5 microg/g creatinine ; in all but one the values exceeded the biological limit ( BEI ) proposed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists .
A dose-related subclinical color vision impairment was observed in Hg-exposed workers compared to the referents .
Just after the survey , working conditions were improved .
Twelve months later the workers were reexamined .
Mean HgU was 10.0 microg/g creatinine and in no subjects was the BEI exceeded .
Color perception was significantly improved compared to the first examination and , furthermore , no differences were observed between exposed workers and referents .
The results add evidence that the color vision loss observed during the first part of the study was related to Hg exposure and , moreover , show that this effect is reversible .
These data indicate that metallic Hg can induce a reversible impairment in color perception .
This suggests that color vision testing should be included in studies on the early effects of Hg .
The possibility of applying the D-15 d as an early effect index in the biological monitoring of Hg exposed workers should also be entertained .
