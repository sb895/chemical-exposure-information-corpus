The aim of our study was to obtain the data on the exposure of breast-fed infants to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and selected organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) in the Wielkopolska province ( Poland ) .
The levels of indicator PCBs , and selected OCPs , including two DDT metabolites ( HCB , p,p'-DDT , p,p'-DDD , p,p'-DDE and alpha,beta,gamma-HCH ) were determined in 27 human milk samples , collected in 2000-2001 , according to WHO protocol .
Estimated daily intakes ( EDIs ) of all analytes were calculated .
Our results were compared with those obtained by an analysis of human milk samples from other European and non-European countries , collected in the same period time .
We have stated that median exposure of Wielkopolska first breast-fed infants to OCPs is comparable ( EDI(HCB) = 0.086 microg/kgbw/day ; EDI(beta-HCH)=0.063 microg/kgbw/day ) or higher ( EDI(p,p'-DDE) = 3.495 microg/kgbw/day ) than in other European countries , while exposure to PCBs ( EDI(Sigma7PCB) = 0.364 microg/kgbw/day ) is situated at the low end of the intake of these xenobiotics by breast-fed infants from different regions of Europe .
