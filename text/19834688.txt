More than 2,000 arsenic-related skin lesions ( as at 2002 ) in a few villages of China's Southwest Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture represent a unique case of endemic arseniasis related with indoor combustion of high-arsenic coal .
The skin lesion prevalence was significantly higher in ethnic Han villagers than in ethnic Hmong villagers .
This study was focused on a possible involvement of XPD/ERCC2 G23591A and A35931C polymorphisms in risk modulation of skin lesions and in the body burden of As in this unique case of As exposure .
G23591A and A35931C were genotyped by a PCR-based procedure .
Total As contents in hair and urine samples as well as environmental samples of the homes of the two ethnic clans were analysed .
A significant higher presentation of A/A35931 ( homozygous wild ) genotype in both clans was found in skin lesion patients , compared with their asymptomatic fellow villagers ( 67.1 vs. 46.3% , OR 2.36 , 95% CI 1.35-4.14 , P=0.002 ) .
Interestingly , the population frequencies of the A/A35931 genotype did not show significant differences between ethnic Han villagers and their Hmong neighbours ( 47.1 vs. 45.5% ) .
Very low frequencies of homozygous and heterozygous variant genotypes of G23591A were recorded in the residents in target village .
G/A23591 and A/A23591 were detected only in 3.2% ( 8/244 ) and 0.8% ( 2/244 ) of the villagers , respectively .
The polymorphic status at the locus of A35931C might modulate the risk for arsenic-related skin lesions in the investigated groups .
