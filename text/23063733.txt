Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) and hexachlorocyclohexanes ( HCHs ) are widely detected in the environment , although they have been banned in China since 1980s .
To better understand the route-specific daily uptake of the pesticides by humans , a total of 322 food , dust , and air samples were collected in Shanghai , China , during 2008-2011 .
The median concentrations were 0.2-126.6 and 0.03-1.6 ng/g wet weight for DDTs ( DDT and its metabolites ) and HCHs , respectively , in different types of foods .
The values in dust ( indoors and outdoors ) were 5.7-29.8 and 1.3-5.4 ng/g , and 13.9×10(-3) and 2.6×10(-3)ng/m(3) in air ( gas+particle ) for DDTs and HCHs , respectively .
The daily uptake of a pesticide by humans was calculated via the pesticide intake multiplied by its uptake efficiency .
The uptake efficiencies of DDTs and HCHs in food through human intestines were estimated using bioaccessibility measured via an in vitro method simulating the human gastrointestinal digestion process .
The total daily uptakes of DDTs and HCHs through three routes ( i.e. , ingestion , inhalation , and dermal contact ) were 79.4 and 4.9 ng/day , respectively , for children , and 131.1 and 8.0 ng/day , respectively , for adults .
Ingestion via food and dust was the main route of human exposure to the pesticides , and the daily uptake of the pesticides via food consumption accounted for 95.0-99.2% of the total .
