Coastal populations with high seafood consumption in the South Caspian Sea ( Iran ) have a significant exposure to dietary mercury .
This study assesses the biomonitoring of mercury in mothers and breastfed infants in the South Caspian Sea .
The mean of mercury concentration in the hair of 93 pairs of mothers and infants was obtained and was 3.55 and 1.89 \u03bcg g(-1) , respectively .
A statistically significant correlation ( R = 0.850 , P = 0.000 ) was seen between mercury concentration in the hair of mothers and infants .
The results of this study indicate that hair mercury concentrations exceeded the USEPA reference dose of 1 \u03bcg g(-1) in 82.7 % of mothers and 61.2 % of infants .
Also , 31 % of the mothers and 10.7 % of the infants had mercury concentrations more than the WHO " threshold " level ( 5 \u03bcg g(-1) ) .
The age and fish consumption of mothers were the factors that significantly affected the hair mercury concentration of mothers and infants .
Number of dental amalgam fillings of mothers was the factor that only affected mercury in the hair of mothers .
According to the results , we can conclude that the main determinant of mercury exposure was the intake of mercury through fish consumption of mothers .
