Sunflower kernels ( SFK ) contain natural Cd in somewhat higher amounts than most other foods .
This study was designed to determine if a change in the body burden of Cd could be measured in volunteers who consumed a controlled amount of SFK for 48 weeks .
Healthy men and women between 23 and 59 years of age were divided into three groups each by age , sex , and weight .
For 48 weeks , one group consumed 255 g ( 9 oz ) of SFK/week , a second group consumed 113 g SFK and 142 g peanuts/week , and a third group consumed 255 g peanuts/week .
SFK contained 0.52 microg Cd/g and peanuts contained 0.11 microg Cd/g .
The consumption of 255 g SFK/week increased the average estimated intake of Cd from approximately 65 to approximately 175 microg/week .
Although the consumption of Cd-containing SFK significantly increased the estimated Cd intake , there were no significant changes in Cd concentration in red blood cells , Cd excretion in the urine , or Cd concentrations in new hair growth .
However , fecal Cd excretion significantly increased as the amount of SFK consumption increased .
N-Acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase , a marker for kidney dysfunctions , was not significantly changed by consuming SFK-Cd .
Overall , the results suggest that the consumption of Cd in the form of SFK at 9 oz ( 255 g)/week for 48 week had no adverse effect on the body burden of Cd .
