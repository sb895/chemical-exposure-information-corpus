The aim of this survey was to use scalp hair as a biomonitor to evaluate the environmental exposure to metals and metalloids of schoolchildren living around the Mt .
Etna area , and to verify whether the degree of human exposure to trace elements is subject to changes in local environmental factors .
Twenty trace elements were determined in 376 samples of scalp hair from schoolboys ( 11-13 years old ) of both genders , living in ten towns located around the volcanic area of Mt .
Etna ( Sicily ) .
The results were compared with those ( 215 samples ) from children living in areas of Sicily characterized by a different geological setting ( reference site ) .
As , U and V showed much higher concentrations at the volcanic site whereas Sr was particularly more abundant at the reference site .
Linear Discriminant Analysis ( LDA ) indicated an Etna factor , made up of V , U and Mn , and a second factor , concerning the reference site , characterized by Ni and Sr , and to a lesser extent by Mo and Cd .
Significant differences in element concentrations were also observed among three different sectors of Mt .
Etna area .
Young people living in the Mt .
Etna area are naturally exposed to enhanced intakes of some metals ( V , U , Mn ) and non-metals ( e.g. , As ) than individuals of the same age residing in other areas of Sicily , characterized by different lithologies and not influenced by volcanic activity .
The petrographic nature of local rocks and the dispersion of the volcanic plume explain the differences , with ingestion of water and local food as the most probable exposure pathways .
