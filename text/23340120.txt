High fish consumption and extended breastfeeding are hallmarks of traditional lifestyle in Western Amazonia .
We studied sources of mercury exposure , fish-methylmercury ( meHg ) and dental-amalgam filling , in 75 urban and 82 rural lactating mothers .
Total mercury was determined in all samples while meHg concentrations were determined in subsamples of milk ( 45 ) and hair ( 27 ) of urban mothers living in Porto Velho ( PV ) and in hair ( 46 ) and milk ( 37 ) of mothers living in traditional communities ( TC ) of the Rio Madeira .
The TC mothers showed significantly higher median hair-Hg concentrations ( 8.2\u03bcgg(-1) ) than PV mothers ( 1.3\u03bcgg(-1) ) .
Median total Hg in milk of PV mothers ( 0.36ngg(-1) ) was significantly lower ( p=0.0000 ) than that found in milk of TC mothers ( 2.30ngg(-1) ) .
The median meHg concentrations in milk of TC mothers were also significantly higher ( 1.0ngg(-1) ) than in milk of PV mothers ( 0.07ngg(-1) ) .
For urban mothers with low fish consumption rates ( and relatively higher dental amalgam fillings ) the proportion of inorganic Hg in milk was higher ( 85% ) than in TC ( 62% ) .
In TC mothers 51% of breast milk Hg concentrations were above 2ngg(-1) ( world median concentrations ) , contrasting with 8% in PV mothers .
Despite this , there was no significant correlation between total Hg concentrations in milk and either amalgam filling or daily fish consumption .
Socioeconomic changes occurring in Western Amazonia are causing changes in fish-eating habits of urban mothers .
However , traditional lifestyle and attendant high fish consumption in riverine populations can still impact total Hg and methylmercury concentrations in mothers ' milk and hair .
