This cross-sectional study was carried out in some selected arsenic contaminated rural areas of Bangladesh to determine any clinical changes in oral cavity , among the arsenic exposed population through drinking water .
Total 600 respondents ( 200 arsenicosis patients , 200 non-patients but having the history of taking arsenic contaminated water and another 200 arsenic non-exposed). 75.5% of arsenicosis patients had swelled vallate papillae whereas only 44.5% and 8.5% in case of arsenic exposure and non-exposure subjects respectively .
