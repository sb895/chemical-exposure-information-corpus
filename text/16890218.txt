To investigate the relations among total mercury levels in hair , toenail , and urine , together with potential effects of methylmercury intake on renal tubular function , we determined their levels , and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity ( NAG ) and alpha1-microglobulin ( AMG ) in 59 women free from occupational exposures , and estimated daily mercury intakes from fish and other seafood using a food frequency questionnaire .
Mercury levels ( mean+/-SD ) in the women were 1.51+/-0.91 microg/g in hair , 0.59+/-0.32 microg/g in toenail , and 0.86+/-0.66 microg/g creatinine in urine ; and , there were positive correlations among them ( P<0.001 ) .
The daily mercury intake of 9.15+/-7.84 microg/day was significantly correlated with total mercury levels in hair , toenail , and urine ( r=0.551 , 0.537 , and 0.604 , P<0.001 ) .
Among the women , the NAG and AMG were positively correlated with both the daily mercury intake and mercury levels in hair , toenail , and urine ( P<0.01 ) ; and , these relations were almost similar when using multiple regression analysis to adjust for possible confounders such as urinary cadmium ( 0.47+/-0.28 microg/g creatinine ) and smoking status .
In conclusion , mercury resulting from fish consumption can explain total mercury levels in hair , toenail , and urine to some degree ( about 30% ) , partly through the degradation into the inorganic form , and it may confound the renal tubular effect of other nephrotoxic agents .
Also , the following equation may be applicable to the population neither with dental amalgam fillings nor with occupational exposures : [ hair mercury ( microg/g)]=2.44x[toenail mercury ( microg/g) ] .
