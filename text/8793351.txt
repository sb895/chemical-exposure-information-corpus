In autopsies performed on residents of Mexico City during the 1950s and 1980s ( 45 males and 24 females and 42 males and 42 females , respectively ) , concentrations of cadmium , copper , cobalt , nickel , and lead in the lungs were studied by atomic absorption spectrometry .
Sharp increases were noted in samples taken in the 1980s compared to those from the 1950s .
In samples from both time periods , the concentrations were influenced by gender .
Smoking was not associated with higher levels of the metals .
Only lead seemed to have a relation with age .
The enormous differences by gender in the 1950s could be due to different patterns of exposure .
The differences among samples from both periods appear to be associated with the increase of air pollutants in the metropolitan areas of Mexico City during the years under study .
These results reinforce the importance of studying lung tissue to monitor air pollution by metals .
