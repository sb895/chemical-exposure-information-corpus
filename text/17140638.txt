Specific elements are bioconcentrated in human hair and nails , which have unique advantages of application in population monitoring studies thereby , recognized as biological tools for disease diagnosis and prevention .
However , investigations are meager for relative element profile in hair and nails of same subjects .
In this study , hair and nails were analyzed to find effects of age , sex , smoking habit , diet , urban and rural exposure gradients , occupation , and health on element levels .
Scalp hair and fingernails were sampled along with a questionnaire from urban and rural subjects of New Delhi ; patients of hypertension , coronary heart disease , and diabetes were identified clinically .
Cadmium , chromium , copper , nickel , lead and zinc concentrations were determined by AAS in both the samples ; CRM ( human hair powder ) analysis showed acceptable precision and accuracy in element measurement .
In comparison to controls , Cr-H and Zn-H levels were lower respectively in female hypertensive and total hypertensive subjects , whereas , Zn-N and Cu-N were lower respectively in total CHD and diabetic subjects , and hypertensive and CHD urban subjects .
Cd concentrations were higher in both the samples of tobacco smoking rural subjects than that of non-smokers .
Farmers had lower Pb-H than rural businessmen did .
Cr , Cu , Ni , and Zn concentrations were different due to rural and urban gradient but not to the influence of age , sex , and diet .
Pb value was alone correlated between the paired samples .
Thus , higher Cd levels in the smokers and lower Cr , Cu and Zn levels in the patients were observed .
