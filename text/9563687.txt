BACKGROUND The New Zealand city of Rotorua sits on a geothermal field .
However , little is known about the possible health impacts of the geothermal emissions .
This was an ecological study that examined cancer incidence and morbidity data for Rotorua .
METHODS Cancer registry and hospital discharge ( morbidity ) data were obtained for the decade 1981-1990 .
Standardized incidence ratios ( SIR ) were calculated comparing Rotorua residents with those living in the rest of New Zealand .
Diagnostic categories examined were based on known target organ systems of hydrogen sulphide toxicity .
RESULTS Of the cancer sites , there was an elevated rate for nasal cancers .
However , this was based on only four cases .
The SIR for cancers of the trachea , bronchus and lung in Maori women was 1.48 ( 95% CI : 1.03-2.06 ) .
This was not explained by higher smoking rates .
In the hospital discharge data , a number of diseases showed elevated SIR , notably diseases of the nervous system and the eye .
To some extent , these effects were characteristic of effects induced by hydrogen sulphide and also mercury compounds .
However , there were few data with which to assess whether significant mercury exposures had occurred , and other explanations were possible .
CONCLUSIONS There are inadequate exposure data for Rotorua to permit conclusions on likely causal associations .
However , some of the elevated disease rates were at least consistent with what one might expect to find if sufficient exposures to hydrogen sulphide and/or mercury were occurring .
