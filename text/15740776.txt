This study investigated the relationship between arsenic concentrations in drinking water in four towns/villages in eastern Croatia and corresponding hair arsenic concentrations of residents .
The mean arsenic concentrations in community drinking water samples were 0.14 , 37.88 , 171.60 , and 611.89 microg/l .
The corresponding mean concentrations of the element in hair samples of subjects residing in each of the localities were 0.07 ( n=11 ) , 0.26 ( n=17 ) , 1.74 ( n=11 ) , and 4.31 microg/g ( n=23 ) .
Chronic exposures to arsenic levels estimated in three investigated locations could present a serious health threat to around 3% of Croatian population .
