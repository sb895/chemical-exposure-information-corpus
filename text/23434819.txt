Polybromodiphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , including the decabromodiphenyl congener ( BDE-209 ) , were determined in the serum of 731 individuals from a general adult population ( 18-74 years ) collected in 2002 in Catalonia ( north-eastern Spain ) .
The BDE-209 was the predominant congener ( median 3.7 ng/g lipid ) followed by BDE-47 ( 2.6 ng/g lipid ) and BDE-99 ( 1.2 ng/g lipid ) .
PBDEs in this population ( median 15.4 ng/g lipid ) ranked amongst the highest of previously described concentrations in populations in Europe , Asia , New Zealand and Australia , yet it was lower than those found in North American reports .
Age was clearly the socio-demographic factor of highest influence on the PBDE distributions .
However , unlike usual trends of higher accumulation of POPs through age , the higher concentrations were found in young individuals ( <30 years ) rather than in adults ( \u226530 years ) , with differences of 14% , 31% and 46% in the most abundant congeners ( i.e .
BDE-209 , BDE-99 and BDE-47 , respectively ) .
This age-dependent distribution of PBDEs ( including the case for BDE-209 , which is shown for the first time in this study ) is explained by the higher and widespread use of these compounds since the 1980s .
In view that these compounds remain highly used , this accumulation pattern is likely to evolve , anticipating an increasing level of PBDE concentrations in future general population surveys , yet probably assuming an age-dependent increase pattern .
Socio-economic level was also a determinant of BDE-47 concentrations , but only relevant for the least affluent class , suggesting that lifestyle and environmental conditions in the dwelling place may also contribute to exposure .
Nonetheless , gender , body mass index , place of birth , parity and education level did not show any statistically significant influence on the observed PBDE distributions .
