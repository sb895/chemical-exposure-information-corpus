This study reports concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in dust samples collected from 17 homes in Kuwait .
PBDEs were measured in all homes investigated with mean summation operatorPBDEs concentration ranging from 1 to 393 ng g(-1) , with a geometric mean of 76 ng g(-1) .
The dominant congener in all samples was BDE 209 constituting ca. 85% of the summationPBDEs followed by BDE 99 ( 5% ) , BDE 47 ( 4.5% ) , and BDE 183 ( 2% ) .
The congener mixture in dust is dominated by those in deca and penta formulations .
Using the measured concentrations and estimates of dust ingestion rates for children and adults , estimated human non-dietary exposure based on mean PBDE levels were 14.8 and 1.5 ng day(-1) for children and adults , respectively .
The 10-fold difference in exposure estimates between children and adults in this study supports previous reports that children are at greater risk from pollutants that accumulate indoors .
The ubiquitous distribution of these chemicals as noted in this study highlights the fact that we are continuously exposed to low doses of chemicals in the indoor environment .
