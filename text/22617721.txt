The objective of this study was to determine blood lead levels ( BLLs ) and the possible sources of exposure in the population of Kinshasa , the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
A cross-sectional survey was carried out from January to May 2008 in a representative sample of the Kinshasan population .
BLL was measured in 275 individuals ( 53.4% women ) aged 1-70 years in the urban area of Kinshasa and from 60 additional subjects in the rural area .
Pb was also determined in environmental specimens ( air and soil , indoor and outdoor ) .
BLL in the study population ranged from 2.9 to 49.3\u2009\u03bcg/dl ( median , 9.9\u2009\u03bcg/dl ) .
The median BLL among children aged <6 years was 11.5\u2009\u03bcg/dl ( range : 3.0-37.8\u2009\u03bcg/dl ) .
Of these children , 71% had elevated BLL ( \u226510\u2009\u03bcg/dl ) and 22% had BLL \u226520\u2009\u03bcg/dl .
The proportion of elevated BLL ( \u226510\u2009\u03bcg/dl ) was higher for children aged <3 years than for children aged 3 to 5 years ( 97% vs 56% ) .
A higher prevalence of elevated BLL was observed in urban compared with rural children ( 71% vs 20% ) .
Significantly higher BLLs were also found in children whose mother consumed fired clay during pregnancy .
Residential informal activities in the recycling of car batteries also contributed to elevated BLL in children .
The elevated background of Pb exposure in the Kinshasan population indicates a public health issue that requires corrective actions .
Pb-contaminated dust and air in children's home is an issue of public health concern .
The use of leaded gasoline and the activities of car battery recycling in certain residences appear to constitute the main sources of exposure in the city of Kinshasa .
The traditional use of fired clay for the treatment of gastritis by pregnant women is another significant contributor for elevated BLL in children .
