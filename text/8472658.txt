A factory survey on dose-response relationship in toluene toxicity was conducted in 1985-1989 in four cities in China .
The examination items consisted of personal diffusive sampling for TWA exposure measurement , questionnaires on subjective symptoms , hematology and serum biochemistry , and clinical examination including simple neurology tests .
Hippuric acid was also determined in urine samples collected at the end of the shift .
With selection criteria that ( 1 ) complete results were available on all study items and ( 2 ) valid toluene exposure data ( i.e. , toluene shared 90% or more of the exposure ) were obtained for the exposed , 452 toluene-exposed workers ( 206 men and 246 women ; toluene exposure at 24.7 ppm as GM ) and 517 nonexposed controls ( 246 men and 271 women ) were selected .
The subjective symptoms increased in close association with the intensity of exposure to toluene ; the threshold concentration appeared to exist at 100 ppm in the case of symptoms during work , and it might be at 50-100 ppm when symptoms off work were evaluated .
During the work with exposure at higher concentrations , various symptoms possibly related to CNS or local effects ( e.g. , eyes , nose , and throat ) were complained , and dizziness and floating sensations were identified as typical symptoms with significant dose-response relationship .
Several symptoms persisted off work , most of which were apparently related but not necessarily limited to CNS effects .
Hematology and serum biochemistry were essentially negative .
