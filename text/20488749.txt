Residents in Arnsberg , Germany , had been supplied by drinking water contaminated with perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) .
Biomonitoring data from 2006 evidenced that plasma PFOA concentrations of residents from Arnsberg were 4.5-8.3 times higher than those in reference groups .
The introduction of charcoal filtration in July 2006 distinctly reduced PFOA concentrations in drinking water .
Our one-year follow-up study showed a 10-20% reduction of PFOA plasma levels in residents from Arnsberg .
Here we report the first results of the two-year follow-up study Arnsberg 2008 .
Additionally , the results of the two-year follow-up examination of the reference group are included .
Paired plasma samples of 138 study participants ( 45 children , 46 mothers and 47 men ) collected in 2006 and 2008 were considered in the statistical analyses .
Within the two years plasma concentrations of PFOA , perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) decreased in residents from Arnsberg and in control groups .
The geometric means of PFOA plasma levels declined by 39% ( children and mothers ) and 26% ( men ) in Arnsberg and by 13-15% in the corresponding subgroups from the reference areas .
For the population from Arnsberg a geometric mean plasma PFOA half-life of 3.26 years ( range 1.03-14.67 years ) was calculated .
Our results confirm an ongoing reduction of the PFOA load in residents from Arnsberg .
The decline of PFC levels in plasma of participants from the reference areas reflects the general decrease of human PFC exposure during the very recent years .
