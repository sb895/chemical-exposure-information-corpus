OBJECTIVE Our aim was to investigate exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in a young urban population in a developing country , with focus on potentially highly exposed children working informally as scrap scavengers at a large municipal waste disposal site .
We also set out to investigate whether hydroxylated metabolites , which not hitherto have been found retained in humans , could be detected .
METHODS We assessed PBDEs in pooled serum samples obtained in 2002 from children 11-15 years of age , working and sometimes also living at the municipal waste disposal site in Managua , and in nonworking urban children .
The influence of fish consumption was evaluated in the children and in groups of women 15-44 years of age who differed markedly in their fish consumption .
Hydroxylated PBDEs were assessed as their methoxylated derivates .
The chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry , using authentic reference substances .
RESULTS The children living and working at the waste disposal site showed very high levels of medium brominated diphenyl ethers .
The levels observed in the referent children were comparable to contemporary observations in the United States .
The exposure pattern was consistent with dust being the dominating source .
The children with the highest PBDE levels also had the highest levels of hydroxylated metabolites .
CONCLUSIONS Unexpectedly , very high levels of PBDEs were found in children from an urban area in a developing country .
Also , for the first time , hydroxylated PBDE metabolites were found to bioaccumulate in human serum .
