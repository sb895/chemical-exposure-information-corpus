The integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model for lead in children was developed to provide plausible blood lead distributions corresponding to particular combinations of multimedia lead exposure .
The model is based on a set of equations that convert lead exposure ( expressed as micrograms per day ) to blood lead concentration ( expressed as micrograms per deciliter ) by quantitatively mimicking the physiologic processes that determine blood lead concentration .
The exposures from air , food , water , soil , and dust are modeled independently by several routes .
Amounts of lead absorbed are modeled independently for air , food , water , and soil/dust , then combined as a single input to the blood plasma reservoir of the body .
Lead in the blood plasma reservoir , which includes extracellular fluids , is mathematically allocated to all tissues of the body using age-specific biokinetic parameters .
The model calculation provides the estimate for blood lead concentration for that age .
This value is treated as the geometric mean of possible values for a single child , or the geometric mean of expected values for a population of children exposed to the same lead concentrations .
The distribution of blood lead concentrations about this geometric mean is estimated using a geometric standard deviation , typically 1.6 , derived from the analysis of well-conducted community blood studies .
