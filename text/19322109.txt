OBJECTIVE To describe a newly recognized US occupational health hazard , polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE ) flame retardant exposure , to US workers at electronics recycling facilities to communicate this information to occupational medicine physicians and related health workers .
METHODS Using PBDE air values reported from a California electronic recycling facility and estimates of US food , air and dust intake , electronic recycling facility workers ' PBDE exposure at this facility was estimated using multiple possible scenarios .
We compared these estimates to intake estimates for the US general population .
Occupational PBDE study findings from China , Sweden , and Norway where elevated environmental or blood PBDE levels were detected in similar workers are reviewed .
RESULTS An approximate 6-fold to 33-fold increase in the electronic recycling facility workers ' PBDE exposure was estimated compared with the US general population .
CONCLUSION PBDE exposure in US electronic recycling facilities is a largely unrecognized occupational health hazard .
The extent of worker exposure in the US should be better characterized and steps taken to lower levels of PBDEs in the workplace where exposure exists .
Health care providers , plant safety professionals , and government agencies can play a role in recognizing the problem and in decreasing worker exposure .
