BACKGROUND A number of studies have shown associations between chronic exposure to particulate air pollution and increased mortality , particularly from cardiovascular disease , but fewer studies have examined the association between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and specific cardiovascular events , such as acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) .
OBJECTIVE We examined how long-term exposure to area particulate matter affects the onset of AMI , and we distinguished between area and local pollutants .
METHODS Building on the Worcester Heart Attack Study , an ongoing community-wide investigation examining changes over time in myocardial infarction incidence in greater Worcester , Massachusetts , we conducted a case-control study of 4,467 confirmed cases of AMI diagnosed between 1995 and 2003 and 9,072 matched controls selected from Massachusetts resident lists .
We used a prediction model based on satellite aerosol optical depth ( AOD ) measurements to generate both exposure to particulate matter \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter ( PM2.5 ) at the area level ( 10 Ã— 10 km ) and the local level ( 100 m ) based on local land use variables .
We then examined the association between area and local particulate pollution and occurrence of AMI .
RESULTS An interquartile range ( IQR ) increase in area PM2.5 ( 0.59 \u03bcg/m3 ) was associated with a 16% increase in the odds of AMI ( 95% CI : 1.04 , 1.29 ) .
An IQR increase in total PM2.5 ( area + local , 1.05 \u03bcg/m3 ) was weakly associated with a 4% increase in the odds of AMI ( 95% CI : 0.96 , 1.11 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Residential exposure to PM2.5 may best be represented by a combination of area and local PM2.5 , and it is important to consider spatial gradients within a single metropolitan area when examining the relationship between particulate matter exposure and cardiovascular events .
