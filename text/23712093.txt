In this study arsenic ( As ) , cadmium ( Cd ) and lead ( Pb ) were determined in 114 samples of various food items collected at supermarkets located in Novi Sad , the capitol of the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina in January 2012 and March 2013 .
The considered items represented the most consumed foodstuffs according to the " national market basket " .
The highest concentrations were obtained for Pb in candy ( 0.323 mg kg(-1) ) , for Cd in paprika ( 0.118 mg kg(-1) ) and for As in canned fish ( 0.43 mg kg(-1) ) .
The results were compared with the relevant data on the occurrence of these toxic elements available in literature for other European countries .
Human health risk assessment through dietary exposure was evaluated for Serbian adult consumers .
The estimated intakes were compared with available toxicological references to assess the risk of As , Cd and Pb intake through consumption of analysed food items .
The highest intake were estimated for Pb being 72.30 \u03bcg day(-1) for adult population , while intakes of As and Cd were significantly lower ( 21.89 \u03bcg day(-1) and 11.51 \u03bcg day(-1) , respectively ) .
