Triclosan and parabens are broad spectrum antimicrobials used in a range of consumer products .
In vitro and animal studies have suggested the potential for these compounds to disrupt thyroid function , though studies in humans have been limited .
The objective of the study was to assess the relationship of urinary concentrations of triclosan and parabens with serum thyroid measures in a large , representative sample of the US population .
We conducted an exploratory , cross-sectional analysis of data on urinary biomarkers of triclosan and paraben exposure and serum thyroid measures obtained from 1831 subjects ( ages\u226512 years ) as part of the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) .
We found evidence of some inverse associations between parabens and circulating thyroid hormone levels in adults , with the strongest and most consistent associations among females .
We also observed a positive association between triclosan and total triiodothyonine ( T3 ) concentrations in adolescents .
These results , in accordance with the in vitro and animal literature , suggest that paraben , and potentially triclosan , exposures may be associated with altered thyroid hormone levels in humans .
Further research is needed for confirmation and to determine the potential clinical and public health significance of these findings .
