BACKGROUND & AIMS The aim of present study was to compare the levels of essential trace and toxic elements in biological samples ( blood , serum and scalp hair ) of female liver cirrhotic/cancer patients ( n=132 ) , of two age groups ( 20-45 years ) and ( 46-60 years ) , before and after sixty days treatment with mineral supplementation .
For comparison purpose , same biological samples were also collected from healthy female subjects ( n=75 ) of same age groups .
METHODS The biological samples were oxidized by 65% HNO(3) : 30% H(2)O(2) ( 2:1 ) in microwave oven .
The digests of all biological samples were analyzed for arsenic ( As ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , selenium ( Se ) and zinc ( Zn ) by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry .
RESULTS The levels of Se and Zn were lower in liver cirrhotic/cancer patients as compared to healthy individuals ( p<0.001 ) .
The patients of liver cirrhosis/cancer have two folds higher As and Cd levels in biological samples as related to age matched referents .
Moreover , negative correlation was observed between essential and toxic elements .
CONCLUSIONS The pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis/cancer has been associated with changes in the balance of certain essential trace and toxic elements .
It was observed that the status of Se and Zn in addition to some biochemical parameters was improved in biological samples of both groups of patients after sixty days treatment with mineral supplementation .
