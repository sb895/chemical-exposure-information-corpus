OBJECTIVES Indigenous people of the Torres Strait ( Australia ) have greater potential for cadmium exposure and renal damage than other Australians due to high cadmium in some traditional seafood and a high prevalence of Type 2 diabetes , hypertension , smoking , and obesity .
This study explored associations between albuminuria and an index of cadmium exposure ( urinary cadmium excretion ) in the presence and absence of Type 2 diabetes .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Two population-based , cross-sectional studies were undertaken in the Torres Strait to obtain data on body mass index ( BMI ) , blood pressure , chronic disease , smoking , urinary cadmium , and albumin creatinine ratio ( ACR ) .
RESULTS Age- and BMI-adjusted urinary cadmium levels were significantly higher ( p<0.01 ) among people with diabetes and albuminuria ( n=22 , geometric mean ( GM ) 1.91 microg Cd/g creatinine ) compared to those with diabetes and normal ACR ( n=21 , GM 0.74 microg Cd/g creatinine ) .
Urinary cadmium was also strongly associated ( p<0.001 ) with ACR among people with diabetes in regression models and remained significant after controlling for age , sex , BMI , smoking status , and hypertension ( or continuous systolic and diastolic measurements ) .
CONCLUSIONS While the study has methodological limitations and the nature of the association is unclear , the striking dose-dependent links between markers of cadmium exposure and of Type 2 diabetic nephropathy highlight the need for further definitive research on the health effects of cadmium in the presence of diabetes .
