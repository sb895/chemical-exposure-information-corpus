Gold mining can release contaminants , including mercury , into the environment , and may increase exposure to naturally occurring elements such as arsenic .
The authors investigated environmental and human tissue concentrations of arsenic and mercury in the gold mining town of Siuna , Nicaragua .
The study involved 49 randomly selected households in Siuna , from whom a questionnaire along with environmental and fingernail samples were collected .
Environmental samples indicated that mercury concentrations in drinking water , although generally low , were higher near the mine site .
Arsenic concentrations were elevated in water and soil samples , but their distribution was unrelated to the mining site .
Mercury concentrations in fingernail samples were correlated with residential proximity to the mine , drinking water concentrations , occupation , and , among children , with soil concentrations .
Fingernail arsenic concentrations correlated with drinking water concentrations among adults who consumed higher levels , and with soil concentrations among children .
Fingernail analysis helped to identify differential exposure pathways in children and adults .
Mercury and arsenic uptake via soil exposure in children warrants further consideration .
