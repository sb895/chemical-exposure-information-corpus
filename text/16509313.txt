Concentrations of 19 perfluorochemicals have been quantified in human blood and in some marine food resources from the region of the Gulf of Gda√±sk at the Baltic Sea south coast in Poland .
We indicate that in addition to PFOS and PFOA , a further 8 perfluorochemicals bioaccumulate in the human body .
Food chain is an important route of exposure for all 10 perfluoroalkyl compounds detected in nonoccupationally exposed humans .
Individuals who declared to have a high fish intake in their diet ( mainly Baltic fish ) on average contained the highest load of all 10 fluorochemicals when compared with the other human subpopulations .
Baltic seafood has been found to highly influence human body burden of PFHxS , PFOS , PFOSA , PFHxA , PFHpA , PFNA , PFDA , PFUnDA , and PFDoDA , and to a lesser extent PFOA .
