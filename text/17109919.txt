This study was conducted to examine PBDE exposure in Koreans , with a special focus on incinerator workers due to their potential for occupational exposure to PBDEs .
A total of 92 blood samples from 30 incinerator workers , 51 nearby residents and 11 controls were analyzed .
The mean total PBDE concentration calculated from the 13 most concentrated congeners for all samples was 16.84+/-7.48 ng/g lipid , which was somewhat higher concentration than in other countries except North America and Canada .
The PBDE levels and congener profiles detected in incinerator workers were not distinctly different from those found in the general population .
In all groups tested , BDE-47 was dominant ( mean contribution=32.5% ) followed by BDE-153 ( 23.6% ) and relatively high portions of BDE-183 ( 16.5% ) were found .
No strong trend was observed between PBDE levels and a number of key biological factors examined in this study , however , weak correlations were observed in PBDE levels measured against dietary habits , particularly in fish consumption frequency and gender .
Overall , our data suggest that the occupational exposure of incinerator workers to PBDEs can be considered minor , while other lifestyle factors can have a greater contribution to PBDE exposure .
