The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of total and inorganic arsenic in dietary supplements composed of herbal plants and seaweed , and to determine the potential toxicological risk .
Total arsenic was determined by dry ashing and hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry , and inorganic arsenic was determined by acid digestion , solvent extraction , and hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry .
Total and inorganic arsenic in the supplements ranged from 0.07 to 8.31mg\u2009kg(-1) dry weight and from 0.14 to 0.28mg\u2009kg(-1) dry weight , respectively .
Daily intake of total arsenic ranged from 0.05 to 12.46\u03bcg\u2009day(-1) .
Inorganic arsenic intake ranged from 0.21 to 0.83\u03bcg\u2009day(-1) , values that are below the Benchmark Dose Lower Confidence Limit recommended by the Word Health Organization .
Therefore , there appears to be a low risk of adverse effects resulting from excess inorganic arsenic intake from these supplements .
This is the first study conducted in Mexico that investigates total and inorganic arsenic in dietary supplements .
Although the results do not suggest toxicological risk , it is nonetheless important considering the toxicity of inorganic arsenic and the increasing number consumer preferences for dietary supplements .
Moreover , it is important to improve and ensure the safety of dietary supplements containing inorganic arsenic .
