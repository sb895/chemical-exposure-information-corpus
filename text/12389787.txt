The aim of the current study is to examine the various factors , which contribute to high levels of mercury ( Hg ) in the hair of Lebanese dentists .
The survey , which was carried out on ninety-nine dentists in the greater Beirut area , included a structured questionnaire designed to provide information about the parameters that influenced their occupational exposure to Hg .
These included : precautionary measures , dental fillings , work habits and lifestyle of the tested dentists .
The study showed that two of the four investigated precautionary measures had a significant effect on Hg level .
The results revealed that , at the 95% confidence levels , Hg concentration in hair was significantly lower among the dentists who always used gloves and masks .
Multiple regression analysis showed that the use of masks ( P = 0.055 ) had significant effects on mercury accumulation in hair .
In addition , dentists who saw more than eight patients per day had marginally higher mercury levels in their hair than those who did not .
Since it was shown that precautionary measures could limit exposure to Hg concentration , then the use of protective measures needs to be emphasized .
