Elevated concentrations of arsenic in groundwater pose a public health threat to millions of people worldwide .
The authors aimed to evaluate the association between arsenic exposure and skin lesion incidence among participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study ( HEALS ) .
The analyses used data on 10,182 adults free of skin lesions at baseline through the third biennial follow-up of the cohort ( 2000-2009 ) .
Discrete-time hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident skin lesions .
Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for incident skin lesions comparing 10.1-50.0 , 50.1-100.0 , 100.1-200.0 , and \u2265200.1 \u03bcg/L with \u226410.0 \u03bcg/L of well water arsenic exposure were 1.17 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.92 , 1.49 ) , 1.69 ( 95% CI : 1.33 , 2.14 ) , 1.97 ( 95% CI : 1.58 , 2.46 ) , and 2.98 ( 95% CI : 2.40 , 3.71 ) , respectively ( P(trend) = 0.0001 ) .
Results were similar for the other measures of arsenic exposure , and the increased risks remained unchanged with changes in exposure in recent years .
Dose-dependent associations were more pronounced in females , but the incidence of skin lesions was greater in males and older individuals .
Chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water was associated with increased incidence of skin lesions , even at low levels of arsenic exposure ( <100 \u03bcg/L ) .
