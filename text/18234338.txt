This study examines the relationship between air pollution , social deprivation and health in the city of Leeds , UK under a baseline and three distance-based road user charging ( RUC ) scenarios set at 2 pence , 10 pence and 20 pence/km .
Through application of a series of linked models of traffic , emission and pollutant dispersion , air quality was modelled in response to RUC scenarios .
The pollutant modelled were NO(2) , PM(10) , CO , benzene and 1,3-butadiene , though results of NO(2) are used in this study .
The RUC scenarios were compared with the ' base ' scenario , all set for the year 2005 .
The RUC initiatives result in the differences in ambient concentrations of NO(2) .
The study correlates NO(2) concentrations with derived indices of social deprivation and health .
The study concludes that positive but weak relationship exists between air quality and social deprivation , and indicates that deprived population groups are disproportionately exposed to higher NO(2) levels .
The relationship between air quality and health status of the population is weak .
There is a strong relationship between social deprivation and health status of the population .
The study concludes that RUC scenarios result in reducing disparity between affluent and deprived populations .
