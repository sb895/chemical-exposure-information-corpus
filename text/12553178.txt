Farmworkers are exposed to pesticides and may take home pesticide residues to their families .
In this paper , self-reported pesticide exposure and home practices to reduce the amount of pesticide residues taken home were examined among 571 farmworkers .
Urine samples from a subsample of farmworkers and children and dust samples from households and vehicles also assessed pesticide exposure .
Overall , 96% of respondents reported exposure to pesticides at work .
Many employers did not provide resources for hand washing .
Farmworkers ' protective practices to keep pesticide residues out of the home were at a low level .
In a subset of respondents , pesticide levels above the limit of quantitation were seen in the urine of children and adults and in house and vehicle dust .
The results support the take-home pathway of pesticide exposure .
Ways must be found to reduce this pesticide exposure among children of farmworkers .
