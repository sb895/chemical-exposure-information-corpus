The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the relation between arsenic exposure from drinking water and plasma levels of markers of systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction ( matrix metalloproteinase-9 , myeloperoxidase , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , soluble E-selectin , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1) ) using baseline data from 668 participants ( age , >30 years ) in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study in Bangladesh ( 2007-2008 ) .
Both well water arsenic and urinary arsenic were positively associated with plasma levels of soluble VCAM-1 .
For every 1-unit increase in log-transformed well water arsenic ( ln \u03bcg/L ) and urinary arsenic ( ln \u03bcg/g creatinine ) , plasma soluble VCAM-1 was 1.02 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.01 , 1.03 ) and 1.04 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.01 , 1.07 ) times greater , respectively .
There was a significant interaction between arsenic exposure and higher body mass index , such that the increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and soluble VCAM-1 associated with arsenic exposure were stronger among people with higher body mass index .
The findings indicate an effect of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water on vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction that could be modified by body mass index and also suggest a potential mechanism underlying the association between arsenic exposure and cardiovascular disease .
