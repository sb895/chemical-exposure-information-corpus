Rice paddy fields in the Naboc area , near Monkayo on the island of Mindanao , Philippines , have been irrigated four times a year over the last decade using Naboc River water contaminated with mercury ( Hg ) by artisanal gold mining in the Diwalwal area .
Silt containing up to at least 90 mg Hg/kg ( d.w. ) has been deposited in rice paddy fields during the 1990s and this has been repeatedly mixed into the rice root zone through ploughing .
Hg in the rice paddy field soils averages 24 mg Hg/kg and generally exceeds the UK and Canadian soil quality thresholds for agricultural soils as well as the proposed Dutch Intervention value and the USEPA soil ingestion Soil Screening Level ( SSL ) for inorganic Hg .
Much lower Hg concentrations ( 0.05-0.99 mg/kg ) within the range expected for uncontaminated soils , characterise soils on which corn and bananas are cultivated , largely because these are not irrigated with Hg-contaminated water from the Naboc River .
The estimated total weekly MeHg intake for a person living in the Naboc area related to the weekly consumption of 2.1 kg of rice grown on Hg-contaminated soils ( 15 microg MeHg ) in conjunction with 1 kg of fish ( 220 microg MeHg ) and 100 g of mussels ( 50 microg MeHg ) from the Naboc River , would total 285 microg MeHg ( equivalent to 4.75 microg/kg bw for a 60 kg adult ) , which is nearly three times the JECFA PTWI of 1.6 microg/kg bw .
This will significantly contribute to the population mercury exposure and might explain why 38% of the local inhabitants were classified as Hg intoxicated during a mercury toxicity assessment [ Drasch GS , BÃ¶se , O'Reilly S , Beinhoff C , Roider G , Maydl S. The Mt .
