Home indoor and outdoor levels , and personal exposures to NO2 were determined for more than 500 subjects in a subpopulation of SAPALDIA by using passive samplers .
The overall personal NO2 average was found to be 27 micrograms m-3 , the overall indoor average 21 micrograms m-3 and the overall outdoor average 31 micrograms m-3 .
Personal NO2 levels ranged between the outdoor and indoor levels , with the exception of study areas with low NO2 concentrations .
In the winter , the indoor/outdoor ratios were lower than in the summer .
Outdoor NO2 levels were higher in winter .
In some study areas , indoor NO2 levels were lower in the winter than in the summer due to reduced ventilation but this was not consistent .
Personal NO2 concentrations were very similar during all seasons .
Gas-cooking and smoking were important factors for elevated indoor and personal NO2 levels ( contribution : 5 micrograms m-3 , 2 micrograms m-3 , respectively ) .
Personal exposure to NO2 correlated best with the indoor NO2 concentrations .
