Fish is an important food resource in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems .
There is a strong cultural background regarding fish consumption ( fish lore ) among indigenous people in the Amazon .
Mercury ( Hg ) ingestion through fish consumption has been a major route of Hg exposure among the riverside people along the Upper Madeira River .
In this paper a diet questionnaire was used to identify patterns of fish consumption .
The amount of fish consumed during the dry season and Hg levels in fish were combined to estimate Hg ingestion .
Using as guidance hair Hg levels below 5 and 10 ppm as acceptable to protect the fetus and adult , respectively , along with an average daily fish consumption of 243 g per capita , we estimated the maximum acceptable number of fish meals per week for different fish species .
Based on this analysis , it is suggested that there is a need to address risk communication for this exposed population in the context of health in terms of a fish advisory .
For the fish advisory it is necessary to recommend to fish consumers , fishermen , and fish sellers an acceptable number of fish meals to be consumed according to species .
