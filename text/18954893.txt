Our research goal was to assess exposure to currently used pesticides among small-scale male farmers residing in two topographically different areas in Chiang Mai Province , Thailand .
Farmers ( N=136 ) were recruited from Pong Yaeng subdistrict ( N=67 ) and Inthakhin subdistrict ( N=69 ) .
Each farmer provided a morning urine void for the analysis of 30 urinary metabolites of insecticides , herbicides , and fungicides .
Farmers in Pong Yaeng had significantly higher urinary concentrations of metabolites of organophosphorus insecticides and ethylene bisdithiocarbamates , while farmers from Inthakhin had significantly higher concentrations of malathion , 2,4-D , alachlor , and parathion or EPN metabolites .
Based upon the metabolites measured in the urine of the farmers , chlorpyrifos and pyrethroid insecticides seemed to be commonly used across both communities ; no significant differences in metabolite concentrations of these insecticides were observed between the two farmer groups .
The presence of methamidaphos in the urine of farmers suggests that , despite a ban on its use , methamidaphos continues to be used in the communities .
A similar finding with metabolites of methyl parathion must be further investigated .
Overall , our results suggest that while each community may use different pesticides , Thai farmers are exposed to a wide variety of pesticides with a broad range in exposure magnitude .
Furthermore , age , field size , crop production type , and the use of protective equipment were found to be potential factors influencing the degree of exposure .
