A cross sectional study using environmental and biological samples was undertaken to assess the association between arsenic ( As ) soil concentrations and urinary As levels of children living in an area where the soil is naturally As rich , during summer and winter .
Twenty-nine children aged between 2 and 7 years from 21 dwellings in the summer study , and 23 of the 29 previous children from 17 dwellings in the winter study , were recruited .
Housing characteristics , living conditions and individual characteristics were collected by questionnaire , and urine samples were collected for iAs+MMA+DMA measurement .
Soil total As content and bioaccessibility were measured .
Urinary As concentrations revealed that the children were not overexposed .
Low bioaccessibility combined with moderately high levels in soil could explain this result .
The concentration of arsenic in soil and soil-related factors appeared to contribute to the children's impregnation in summer but not in winter , which could be related to the children's behavior .
This study highlights the need for additional studies of children to better understand their behavior , and obtain reference values in this particular population .
