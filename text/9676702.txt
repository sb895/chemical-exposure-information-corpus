The objective of this study was to assess whether arsenic exposure is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus as indicated in a few earlier studies .
Arsenic in drinking water is known to occur in western Bangladesh , and in 1996 , two of the authors conducted a survey of the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among 163 subjects with keratosis taken as exposed to arsenic and 854 unexposed individuals .
Diabetes mellitus was determined by history of symptoms , previously diagnosed diabetes , glucosuria , and blood sugar level after glucose intake .
The crude prevalence ratio for diabetes mellitus among keratotic subjects exposed to arsenic was 4.4 ( 95% confidence interval 2.5-7.7 ) and increased to 5.2 ( 95% confidence interval 2.5-10.5 ) after adjustment for age , sex , and body mass index .
On the basis of a few earlier measurements of arsenic concentrations in drinking water by the authorities in Bangladesh and another 20 new ad hoc analyses , approximate time-weighted exposure levels to arsenic in drinking water could be estimated for each subject .
Three time-weighted average exposure categories were created , i.e. , less than 0.5 , 0.5-1.0 , and more than 1.0 mg/liter .
For the unexposed subjects , the corresponding prevalence ratios were 1.0 , 2.6 , 3.9 , and 8.8 , representing a significant trend in risk ( p < 0.001 ) .
The result corroborates earlier studies and suggests that arsenic exposure is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus .
