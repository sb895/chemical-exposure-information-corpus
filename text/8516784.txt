The smoking habits of 119 subjects without silver/mercury dental fillings were compared to 115 subjects with amalgams .
The amalgam group had 2.5-times more smokers per group than the non-amalgam group , which was highly significant .
Because mercury decreases dopamine , serotonin , norepinephrine , and acetylcholine in the brain , and nicotine has just the opposite effect on these neurotransmitters , this may help explain why persons with dental amalgams smoke more than persons without amalgams .
