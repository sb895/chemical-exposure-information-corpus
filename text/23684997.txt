In 2011 the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration reported that plasticizers di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) and di-iso-nonyl phthalate ( DiNP ) , endocrine disruptors , were illegally added to clouding agents used in foods and beverages. 965 products were found contaminated , of which 206 were exported to 22 countries .
This study's purpose was to obtain English names for 28 contaminated products for which DEHP levels were reported , calculate estimated average daily intake ( mg/kg/day ) for a 50 kg woman consuming one portion , and compare to U.S. and E.U. guidelines for daily intake .
We found that drinking just one bottle ( 500 ml ) of sports drinks would result in an average DEHP intake of 0.14 mg/kg bw/day ( range 0.091-0.341 ) , which exceeds by several fold government guidelines ( 0.02-0.06 mg/kg bw/day ) .
One ( 2 g ) serving from 4/14 samples of contaminated dietary supplements exceeds the guideline of 0.02 mg/kg bw/day .
In conclusion , consuming even one portion of tainted drinks and some powders would lead to daily intake of DEHP that greatly exceeds established safety guidelines , raising concerns about potential adverse effects , particularly reproductive tract development in the male fetus .
Global distribution of DEHP-contaminated and other adulterated products should prompt governments to become proactive in food safety regulations and chemical testing .
