Elevated lead levels were discovered in blood samples collected from family members where both the father and the mother worked in a radiator repair workshop .
The father and mother were found to have blood lead levels of 2.0 and 0.5 mumol/L ( 41.7 and 10.4 micrograms/dL ) , respectively .
The father's blood lead level was just below the Canadian occupational health and safety intervention level ( 2.5 mumol/L or 52.1 micrograms/dL ) .
The two children had blood lead levels of 1.0 and 0.8 mumol/L ( 20.8 and 16.7 micrograms/dL ) , both of which are in excess of the recommended guideline for intervention in the case of children ( 0.5 mumol/L or 10.4 micrograms/dL ) .
The exposure of the two children was possibly due to a combination of pathways including exposure at the workshop itself during visits and also the transportation of lead-containing dust to the home environment .
