In order to assess soil As contamination and potential risk for human , soil , paddy rice , vegetable and human hair samples from the areas near the industrial districts in Chenzhou , southern China were sampled and analyzed .
The results showed that the anthropogenic industrial activities have caused in local agricultural soils to be contaminated with As in a range of 11.0-1217 mg/kg .
The GIS-based map shows that soil contamination with As occurred on a large scale , which probably accounted for up to 30% of the total area investigated .
Soil As concentration abruptly decreased with an increase in the distance from the polluting source .
High As concentrations were found in the rice grain that ranged from 0.5 to 7.5 mg/kg , most of which exceed the maximal permissible limit of 1.0 mg/kg dry matter .
Arsenic accumulated in significantly different levels between leafy vegetables and non-leafy vegetables .
Non-leafy vegetables should be recommended in As-contaminated soils , as their edible parts were found in relatively low As level .
Arsenic concentrations in 95% of the total human hair samples in the contaminated districts were above the critical value , 1.0 mg/kg , set by the World Health Organization .
Arsenic could be enriched in human hair to very high levels without being affected by As containing water .
The results revealed that the soils and plants grown on them are major contributors to elevate hair As in the industrial population .
Therefore , the potential impact on human health of ingestion/inhalation of soil As around the industrial districts seems to be rather serious .
Hence proper treatments for As contaminated soils are urgently needed to reduce the contamination .
