Phthalate exposure has been associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes in limited epidemiologic studies , and inflammation and oxidative stress have been hypothesized as potential mechanisms involved .
In the present study we investigated associations between urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites and potential blood markers of oxidative stress ( bilirubin ) and inflammation ( alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ] , absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] , ferritin [ adjusted for iron status ] , and fibrinogen ) , using data from 10,026 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) recruited between 1999 and 2006 .
After adjustment for covariates we found that bilirubin was inversely associated with several phthalate metabolites ( all p-values <0.0001 ) , including the metabolites of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) and dibutyl phthalate ( DBP ) , in addition to monobenzyl phthalate ( MBzP ) and mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate ( MCPP ) .
Since bilirubin is a potent antioxidant these relationships suggest that phthalates may be associated with increased oxidative stress .
Many of the same metabolites were also significantly and positively related with ANC , ALP , and ferritin , suggesting phthalates may be associated with increased inflammation .
These markers may be useful in other studies of low-dose exposure to environmental contaminants .
