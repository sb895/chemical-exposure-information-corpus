Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in market fish have not previously been reported in Hong Kong .
Axial and ventral muscles from 10 each common species of freshwater and marine fish purchased from markets in Hong Kong were analyzed for 22 PBDEs .
Among the 10 freshwater fish species , spotted snakehead ( Channa maculate ) contained the highest level of PBDEs in ventral muscle ( 130 ng g(-1) wet wt. ) .
For marine fish , bigeye ( Priacanthus macracanthus ) showed significantly higher levels of PBDEs ( 60.7 ng g(-1)wet wt. in ventral tissue ) than all other marine species .
The levels of PBDEs in fish samples ranged from 0.53 to 130 ng g(-1)wetwt .
The tetrabrominated congener BDE-47 and pentabrominated BDE-99 were the predominant congeners , which accounted for 27% and 30% , respectively , of the total PBDEs .
Daily PBDE intake was calculated according to the different fish consumption rate for Hong Kong consumers , and the results ranged from 222 to 1198 ng day(-1) for marine fish and 403-2170 ng day(-1) for freshwater fish .
The daily PBDE intake from fish reported here were higher than those reported from the United States ( 8.94-15.7 ng day(-1) ) and Europe ( 14-23.1 ng day(-1) ) .
