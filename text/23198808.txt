This study investigates the risk of arsenic ( As ) exposure to the communities in rural Bengal , even when they have been supplied with As safe drinking water .
The estimates of exposure via dietary and drinking water routes show that , when people are consuming water with an As concentration of less than 10 \u03bcg L(-1) , the total daily intake of inorganic As ( TDI-iAs ) exceeds the previous provisional tolerable daily intake ( PTDI ) value of 2.1 \u03bcg day(-1) kg(-1) BW , recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in 35% of the cases due to consumption of rice .
When the level of As concentration in drinking water is above 10 \u03bcg L(-1) , the TDI-iAs exceeds the previous PTDI for all the participants .
These results imply that , when rice consumption is a significant contributor to the TDI-iAs , supplying water with an As concentration at the current national drinking water standard for India and Bangladesh would place many people above the safety threshold of PTDI .
We also found that the consumption of vegetables in rural Bengal does not pose a significant health threat to the population independently .
This study suggests that any effort to mitigate the As exposure of the villagers in Bengal must consider the risk of As exposure from rice consumption together with drinking water .
