A simultaneous study on workers ' and swimmers ' exposure to trihalomethanes ( THMs ) in an indoor swimming pool has been carried out by analyzing urine samples using the headspace and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique .
The subjects of this study were male and female workers of an indoor swimming pool as well as swimmers regularly attending the pool .
The results reported show that only chloroform and bromodichloromethane were detected in the urine of those people exposed , which can be used as a specific index of exposure to these compounds .
THM uptake of swimmers after 1 h of swimming was higher than that of workers after a 4 h work shift since THM levels in the workers ' urine were associated only with inhalation , while levels in swimmers ' urine were mainly associated with dermal absorption , apart from inhalation and occasional ingestion , as well as increased uptake due to the physical stress ( swimming ) .
The kinetics of THM excretion in the urine of the participants exposed has been calculated after termination of the exposure to select the sampling time and determine the elimination process .
An interval of 15 min after exposure was selected as the sampling time , and the absorbed dosage was eliminated by 2 h after exposure .
A good correlation between THM concentrations found in the swimming pool water and the urinary THM concentrations of the people affected after exposure has also been obtained .
