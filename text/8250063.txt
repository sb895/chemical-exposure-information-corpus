The risk of silicosis was investigated in a cohort of 2,235 white South African gold miners who had , on average , 24 years of net service from 1940 to the early 1970s and who were followed up to 1991 for radiological signs of onset of silicosis ( ILO category 1/1 or more ) .
There were 313 ( 14% ) miners who developed signs of silicosis at an average age of 55.9 years .
The latency period was largely independent of the cumulative dust exposure .
In 57% of the silicosis , the radiological signs developed , on average , 7.4 years after mining exposure ceased .
The risk of silicosis increased exponentially with the cumulative dust dose , the accelerated increase being after 7 mg/m3-years .
At the highest exposure level of 15 mg/m3-years , which represents approximately 37 years of gold mining at an average respirable dust concentration of 0.4 mg/m3 , the cumulative risk for silicosis reached 77% .
In conclusion , the risk of silicosis was strongly dose dependent ; however , the latency period was largely independent of the dose .
