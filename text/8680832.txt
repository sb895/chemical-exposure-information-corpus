Chlorinated biphenyl methylsulfones and biphenylols were determined in samples of human milk from Canadian donors .
Fifty samples containing an average of 10.8 ng g-1 ( w/w ) of total PCBs were found to contain an average of 68 pg g-1 of chlorinated biphenyl methylsulfone .
The major congeners were 3-methylsulfonyl-2,2',4',5,5',-pentachlorobiphenyl , 4-methylsulfonyl-2,2',3',4',5,-pentachlorobiphenyl and 4-methylsulfonyl-2,2',3',5,5',6'-hexachlorobiphenyl .
Twelve of these samples were analyzed for five chlorinated biphenylols and the 4-methoxy-2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachlorobiphenylol congener was detected in all at an average concentration of 1.9 pg g-1 .
The chlorinated biphenylols appear to be minor residual metabolites in human milk from the general population .
The fifty samples with an average of 8.4 ng g-1 of p,p'-DDE also contained an average of 16.5 pg g-1 of the corresponding methylsulfone .
Both the total PCB methylsulfone and p,p ' DDE methylsulfone were correlated with total PCB and p,p ' DDE contents , respectively .
