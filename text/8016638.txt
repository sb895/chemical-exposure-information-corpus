The objectives of this study were the determination of : ( a ) benzene ( B ) , toluene ( T ) and xylene ( X ) air pollution in three sites of the Piedmont region ( north-western Italy ) , ( b ) the relationship between BTX pollution in indoor , outdoor and personal air measured for a group of non-smoking university students , ( c ) the influence of environmental tobacco smoke on the level of BTX exposure for indoor air environments .
Results indicate ( i ) a direct relationship between human density and level of contamination and higher toluene pollution , ( ii ) an indoor/outdoor ratio of > 1 for all the three aromatics , ( iii ) a similar level of personal and indoor air contamination .
Human exposure to BTX air pollution has been found to depend principally on indoor air contamination , not only on home pollution , but also , probably on many other confined environments .
