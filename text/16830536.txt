Pooled serum samples from 3802 Australian residents were analyzed for four perfluoroalkylsulfonates , seven perfluoroalkylcarboxylates , and perfluorooctanesulfonamide ( PFOSA ) .
Serum was collected from men and women of five different age groups and from rural and urban regions in Australia .
The highest mean concentration was obtained for perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS , 20.8 ng/mL ) followed by perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA , 7.6 ng/mL ) , perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS , 6.2 ng/mL ) , perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA , 1.1 ng/mL ) , and PFOSA ( 0.71 ng/mL ) .
Additional four PFCs were detected in 5-18% of the samples at concentrations near the detection limits ( 0.1-0.5 ng/mL ) .
An increase in PFOS concentration with increasing age in both regions and genders was observed .
The male pool levels of some of the age groups compared to females were higherfor PFOS , PFOA , and PFHxS .
In contrast , PFNA concentrations were higher in the female pools .
No substantial difference was found in levels of PFCs between the urban and rural regions .
The levels are equal or higher than previously reported serum levels in Europe and Asia but lower compared to the U.S.A. These results suggest that emissions from production in the Northern Hemisphere are of less importance for human exposure .
