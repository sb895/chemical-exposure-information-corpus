Indonesian artisanal and small-scale gold mining activities ( ASGM ) have been described for the islands of Borneo ( Kalimantan ) and Sulawesi .
But the increased gold price over recent years has seen operations extend to the islands of Lombok and Sumbawa .
For the current research , an environmental assessment was conducted across three new ASGM locations .
Gold is recovered by miners through a two-stage process of whole-ore amalgamation and cyanidation .
Waste ( tailings ) is discharged to land or sea with no concern for contaminants in the tailings .
The gold grade of ore is up to 5000 mg kg(-1) .
The mean gold grade of the amalgamation tailings is 7 mg kg(-1) , dropping to 1.2 mg kg(-1) for the cyanidation tailings .
The mean mercury concentration of the amalgamation tailings is about 3000 mg kg(-1) and greater than 1600 mg kg(-1) for the cyanidation tailings .
Samples of paddy rice grain collected adjacent to cyanidation tailings ponds showed methyl mercury concentrations greater than 100 ng g(-1) .
This is five times above the Chinese permissible level for total mercury in food crops .
The mean total mercury concentration in hair of Lombok ASGM workers was greater than that in a non-exposed population ; however there was no difference in methyl mercury concentration .
This indicates the primary pathway of mercury exposure is inhalation of volatile mercury in the atmosphere .
Future exposure may come from ingestion of methyl mercury contaminated rice where discharge of cyanide tailings to paddies continues .
To protect the environment and to enhance the sustainability of ASGM , appropriate tailings management must be implemented .
The gold grade of the tailings indicates that the residual value might be recoverable with appropriate technology .
Ongoing research is investigating systems such as phytoextraction that might assist ASGM operators in Lombok and Sumbawa to improve their environmental performance .
