The lifetime cancer risk and the hazard index of trihalomethanes ( THMs ) through oral ingestion , dermal absorption , and inhalation exposure from tap water in 19 districts in Hong Kong are estimated .
The most dominant THMs are chloroform and bromodichloromethane ( BDCM ) in Hong Kong tap water .
Among the three different pathways , residents have a higher risk of cancer through oral ingestion than through the other two pathways .
The lifetime cancer risks through oral ingestion and dermal absorption for BDCM make the highest percentage contribution ( 59% ) to total risks , followed by chloroform ( 24% ) .
The chloroform and BDCM are at or above the negligible risk level of 10(-6) by a factor of 10 or more in most districts .
Among the 19 districts , people living in Sai Kung have the highest risk of cancer due to the THM exposure through the multipathways , mainly because of the exposure to BDCM and dibromochloromethane ( DBCM ) .
The total cancer risk analysis indicates that each year approximately 10 out of the seven million Hong Kong residents could get cancer from the daily intake of water .
