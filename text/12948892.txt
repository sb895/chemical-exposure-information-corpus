Studies have suggested that children living close to busy roads may have impaired respiratory health .
This study was designed to test the hypothesis that exposure to exhaust from heavy traffic in particular is related to childhood respiratory health .
Children attending 24 schools located within 400 m from busy motorways were investigated .
The motorways carried between 5,190 and 22,326 trucks per weekday and between 30,399 and 155,656 cars per day .
Locations were chosen so that the correlation between truck and car traffic counts was low .
Air pollution measurements were performed at the schools for 1 year .
Respiratory symptoms were collected by parent-completed questionnaire .
Sensitization to common allergens was measured by serum immunoglobulin E and skin prick tests .
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) was measured with a hypertonic saline challenge .
Respiratory symptoms were increased near motorways with high truck but not high car traffic counts .
They were also related to air pollutants that increased near motorways with high truck traffic counts .
Lung function and BHR were not related to pollution .
Sensitization to pollen increased in relation to truck but not car traffic counts .
The relation between symptoms and measures of exposure to ( truck ) traffic-related air pollution were almost entirely restricted to children with BHR and/or sensitization to common allergens , indicating that these are a sensitive subgroup among all children for these effects .
