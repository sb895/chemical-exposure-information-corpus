The aim of this study was to determine human prenatal and postnatal exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs ( polychlorobiphenylols ; OH-PCBs ) , and pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) .
The median PBDE fresh-weight concentrations in maternal and cord blood plasma and in breast milk were 24 , 4.3 , and 75 pg/g , respectively .
The PCB concentrations were approximately 60 times higher in each compartment ( 1,560 , 277 , and 4,310 pg/g , respectively ) .
Calculated on a lipid weight basis , the levels were comparable in maternal blood plasma and breast milk .
In contrast to PCBs , differences were found between PBDE congener distribution in maternal and cord blood plasma .
The OH-PCBs constituted up to 26% of the PCB levels in maternal blood plasma and 53% in cord blood plasma , with levels of 120 and 88 pg/g fresh weight , respectively , and in breast milk 3 pg/g .
The corresponding concentrations for PCP were 2,830 , 1,960 , and 20 pg/g .
The ratios of PCB to OH-PCB were 13 , 3 , and 1,400 in maternal , cord plasma , and breast milk , respectively .
It is evident that prenatal exposures occur for all the analytes .
Moreover , the exposure continues after birth via breast milk .
However , levels of OH-PCBs and PCP in breast milk are low compared with levels in blood plasma .
Exposures to both PCBs and PBDEs , and in particular to the endocrine-active halogenated phenolic compounds , are of concern and implicate a potential risk for developmental disturbances .
