A study was conducted to explore the effect of arsenic causing conjunctivitis , neuropathy and respiratory illness in individuals , with or without skin lesions , as a result of exposure through drinking water , contaminated with arsenic to similar extent .
Exposed study population belongs to the districts of North 24 Parganas and Nadia , West Bengal , India .
A total of 725 exposed ( 373 with skin lesions and 352 without skin lesions ) and 389 unexposed individuals were recruited as study participants .
Participants were clinically examined and interviewed .
Arsenic content in drinking water , urine , nail and hair was estimated .
Individuals with skin lesion showed significant retention of arsenic in nail and hair and lower amount of urinary arsenic compared to the group without any skin lesion .
Individuals with skin lesion also showed higher risk for conjunctivitis ( (odd's ratio ) OR : 7.33 , 95% CI : 5.05-10.59 ) , peripheral neuropathy ( OR : 3.95 , 95% CI : 2.61-5.93 ) and respiratory illness ( OR : 4.86 , 95% CI : 3.16-7.48 ) compared to the group without any skin lesion .
The trend test for OR of the three diseases in three groups was found to be statistically significant .
Again , individuals without skin lesion in the exposed group showed higher risk for conjunctivitis ( OR : 4.66 , 95% CI : 2.45-8.85 ) , neuropathy ( OR : 3.99 , 95% CI : 1.95-8.09 ) , and respiratory illness ( OR : 3.21 , 95% CI : 1.65-6.26 ) when compared to arsenic unexposed individuals .
Although individuals with skin lesions were more susceptible to arsenic-induced toxicity , individuals without skin lesions were also subclinically affected and are also susceptible to arsenic-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity when compared to individuals not exposed to arsenic .
