The exposure to benzene , toluene , xylenes and total hydrocarbons among 25 individuals exposed to exhaust from a snowmobile equipped with a two-stroke engine has been evaluated .
Sampling was performed by pumped and diffusive sampling in parallel .
There was a relatively bad agreement between the two air-sampling methods .
The bad agreement can in part be explained by back diffusion of the substances from the samplers , a high face velocity , and deposition of droplets of unburned gasoline onto or in the vicinity of the samplers .
The levels of benzene ranged from not detectable ( < or =0.01 mgm(-3) ) to 2.5 mgm(-3) .
For toluene , xylenes and total hydrocarbons the exposure was 0.10-12.0 , < or =0.05-13.0 and 0.90-273 mgm(-3) respectively .
The result from two measurements on individuals travelling on an open sleigh at the rear of the vehicle indicated higher levels of benzene , 0.7-0.8 mgm(-3) .
Children are often riding as a passenger on a sledge and may thus have a higher exposure than their parents .
This study indicates that spare time driving a snowmobile may cause a considerable exposure to benzene .
Using a four-stroke engine equipped with a catalyst could reduce the exposure .
To reduce the exposure for the passenger on a sleigh an extension of the exhaust pipe may be effective .
