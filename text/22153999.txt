Mercury is a ubiquitous , persistent toxicant found in the environment .
In water , mercury bioaccumulates up the food chain and leads to high concentrations in fish .
Consumption of contaminated fish is the major source of exposure to mercury in the US .
The objective of this study was to enroll persons living in areas selected by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to have high mercury concentrations and who consume at least 6o z of locally caught fish per week to determine the feasibility of monitoring future trends among a population identified as highly exposed .
Blood samples were collected at time of interview and analyzed for mercury .
Participants ( n=287 ) were enrolled from North Carolina , Maryland , and South Dakota .
Participants reported eating an average of five servings of fish per week .
The overall geometric mean for total mercury was 0.75 \u03bcg L(-1) , with North Carolina having the highest mean level ( 2.02 \u03bcg L(-1) ) .
Overall , 42% of the study population had levels greater than the US geometric mean 0.83 \u03bcg L(-1) .
The number of servings of fish consumed was not found to be associated with blood mercury levels .
We were able to identify some persons with elevated mercury concentrations living in areas identified by EPA ; however , identifying and monitoring a highly exposed population over time would be challenging .
