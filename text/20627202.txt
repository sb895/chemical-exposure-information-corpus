The objective of this study was to determine benzene and 1,3-butadiene exposure through ambient air and personal air monitoring , as well as through biomarkers of exposure , and to evaluate the potential health risk of exposure through the use of biomarkers of early biological effects in central Bangkok traffic policemen .
Ambient air concentrations of benzene and 1,3-butadiene at the roadsides were significantly higher than in police offices used as control sites ( p<0.001 ) .
Traffic policemen had a significantly higher exposure to benzene ( median 38.62 microg/m(3) ) and 1,3-butadiene ( median 3.08 microg/m(3) ) than office policemen ( median 6.17 microg/m(3) for benzene and 0.37 microg/m(3) for 1,3-butadiene ) ( p<0.001 ) .
Biomarkers of benzene exposure , blood benzene , and urinary metabolite , trans , trans-muconic acid were significantly higher in traffic policemen than office policemen ( p<0.001 ) .
No significant difference between traffic and office policemen was found in urinary benzene metabolite , S-phenyl mercapturic acid , or in urinary 1,3-butadiene metabolite , monohydroxy-butenyl mercapturic acid .
Biomarkers of early biological effects , 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in leukocytes ( 8-OHdG ) , DNA-strand breaks , and DNA-repair capacity , measured as an increase in gamma ray-induced chromosome aberrations were significantly higher in traffic policemen than controls ( p<0.001 for 8-OHdG , p<0.01 for tail length , p<0.001 for olive tail moment , p<0.05 for dicentrics and p<0.01 for deletions ) .
Multiple regression model including individual exposure , biomarkers of exposure , ages and years of work as independent variables showed that only the levels of individual 1,3-butadiene exposure were significantly associated with 8-OHdG and olive tail moment at p<0.0001 indicating more influence of 1,3-butadiene on DNA damage .
These results indicated that traffic policemen , who are exposed to benzene and 1,3-butadiene at the roadside in central Bangkok , are potentially at a higher risk for development of diseases such as cancer than office policemen .
