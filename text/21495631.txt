Breast milk samples collected during 2003-2005 from 82 first-time mothers in 24 communities located throughout California contained levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( \u2211(tri-hexa ( 8))PBDEs ; median = 53.3 ng/g lw , range = 9.60-1291 ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( \u2211(12)PCBs ; median = 73.4 ng/g lw , range = 22.2-433 ) that are among the highest in the world .
PBDE levels varied 100-fold .
BDE-47 was the dominant PBDE congener , with levels exceeding the U.S.EPA Reference Dose ( RfD ) for neurodevelopmental toxicity ( 100 ng/kg/day ) in most ( 60% ) breast milk samples .
In some samples , BDE-209 ( 2/82 ) and/or BDE-153 ( 5/82 ) were the dominant congeners , suggesting that BDE-209 can transfer to breast milk and/or break down in the mother and transfer to the nursing infant as the lower-brominated PBDEs associated with adverse effects .
PBDE levels in California breast milk are approaching those of PCBs , and the trend PBDEs > PCBs may continue as PBDEs migrate from products to the indoor and outdoor environments .
