OBJECTIVE The aim of the work is to define occupational exposure to styrene in fiberglass manufacture ; the phase of stretching styrene resins needs some manual handling and leads workers to be exposed to styrene .
METHODS We surveyed 20 workers in two companies manufacturing fiberglass , checking environmental levels and urinary concentrations of mandelic acid ( MA ) , and phenylglioxylic acid ( PGA ) .
Workers completed a questionnaire collecting their medical history .
RESULTS Environmental monitoring showed some styrene concentrations higher than the threshold limit value-time-weighted average .
Biological monitoring confirmed these findings and four workers had levels of urinary PGA and MA concentrations higher than the Biological Exposure Indices of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists .
CONCLUSIONS This picture confirms that , even though the risk is known and the manufacturing cycle is well-defined , workers nevertheless risk exposure .
More research is needed to optimize the work processes and the protection systems to lower this risk .
