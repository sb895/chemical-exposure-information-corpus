Since the appearance of DDT , increasingly potent insecticides have been developed to overcome the resistance developed by insects to successive products .
Pesticides are also used in public health programs to control disease vectors .
Despite legislation to control the use of certain products , they repeatedly appear in the adipose tissue , milk and serum of human populations .
The present study determined the presence of organochlorine molecules in the adipose tissue , serum , and umblical cord of women giving birth by cesarean section in order to establish a possible correlation in organochlorine molecule content between these biological compartments and to examine fetal exposure to molecules with hormonal effects .
Presence of nine organochlorines was detected by GC/ECD and confirmed by GC/MS .
Highly significant differences ( p<0.000 ) were observed between adipose tissue and maternal serum in concentrations of lindane , HCB , DDE , DDD , and endosulfan but not ( p>0.5 ) in concentrations of endosulfan II or endosulfan sulfate .
Only DDE concentrations differed ( p<0.001 ) between maternal serum and umbilical cord serum .
An association between pp'DDE and op'DDT was observed in maternal serum ( p<0.094 ) .
An association in pp'DDE and pp'DDD content was found between adipose tissue and umbilical cord serum , and in pp'DDT content between adipose tissue and maternal serum .
Results obtained indicate that exposure can be measured solely in serum when relatively high concentrations of pesticides are present .
