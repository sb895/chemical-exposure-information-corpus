Amalgam has been used as a filling material for over 150 years .
Mercury , copper , and zinc are present in restoration .
The aim of this study was to compare mercury , copper , and zinc concentrations in extracted human teeth with amalgam restorations and teeth without restorations .
Thirty-two teeth , 15 restored with dental amalgam and 17 without restorations , were chemically analyzed in an Optima 3300 DV ( Perkin Elmer ) plasma emission spectrometer .
Mercury , copper , and zinc were found in human teeth regardless of the presence of amalgam restorations .
The highest mercury concentrations were found in the coronary portions of the teeth with amalgam restorations .
Copper concentrations were very high .
Zinc concentrations in the teeth without restoration were lower than those seen in the coronary portion of the teeth with restorations .
