Drinking water intake of arsenic ( As ) from private wells may represent a significant exposure pathway and induce oxidative DNA damage .
We measured total As concentrations in hair and nails , and concentrations of the different species of As and its metabolites as well as 8-OHdG in urine of 110 non-smoking adults living in a rural region of the Province of Quebec , Canada .
Significant differences in exposure biomarker levels were observed between individuals consuming drinking water with As levels of\u22641.0,>1.0 -\u226410 and>10\u2009\u03bcg/l .
Multivariate linear regression analysis also showed a significant relationship between estimated daily drinking water intakes of As and biomarker levels .
Conversely , 8-OHdG levels were not significantly related to daily drinking water intakes of As or to hair , nail or urinary exposure biomarker levels , according to multivariate linear regression analysis .
Even at the relatively low levels of As found in well water of our participants , water consumption significantly increases their body load of As , as confirmed by multiple matrix measurements , which reflected exposure over different time frames .
However , this increased internal As dose was not associated with higher oxidative damage to DNA as reflected by urinary 8-OHdG levels .
