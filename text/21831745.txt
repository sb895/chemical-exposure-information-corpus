BACKGROUND Bisphenol A ( BPA ) is a synthetic estrogen commonly used in polycarbonate plastic and resin-lined food and beverage containers .
Exposure of animal and cell models to doses of BPA below the recommended tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) of 50 \u03bcg/kg/day have been shown to alter specific estrogen-responsive gene expression , but this has not previously been shown in humans .
OBJECTIVE We investigated associations between BPA exposure and in vivo estrogenic gene expression in humans .
METHODS We studied 96 adult men from the InCHIANTI population study and examined in vivo expression of six estrogen receptor , estrogen-related receptor , and androgen receptor genes in peripheral blood leukocytes .
RESULTS The geometric mean urinary BPA concentration was 3.65 ng/mL [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 3.13 , 4.28 ] , giving an estimated mean excretion of 5.84 \u03bcg/day ( 95% CI : 5.00 , 6.85 ) , significantly below the current TDI .
In age-adjusted models , there were positive associations between higher BPA concentrations and higher ESR2 [ estrogen receptor 2 ( ER beta) ] expression ( unstandardized linear regression coefficient = 0.1804 ; 95% CI : 0.0388 , 0.3221 ; p = 0.013 ) and ESRRA ( estrogen related receptor alpha ) expression ( coefficient = 0.1718 ; 95% CI : 0.0213 , 0.3223 ; p = 0.026 ) : These associations were little changed after adjusting for potential confounders , including obesity , serum lipid concentrations , and white cell subtype percentages .
Upper-tertile BPA excretors ( urinary BPA > 4.6 ng/mL ) had 65% higher mean ESR2 expression than did lower-tertile BPA excretors ( 0-2.4 ng/mL ) .
CONCLUSIONS Because activation of nuclear-receptor-mediated pathways by BPA is consistently found in laboratory studies , such activation in humans provides evidence that BPA is likely to function as a xenoestrogen in this sample of adults .
