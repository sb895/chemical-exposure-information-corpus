Levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) were measured in the breast milk of mothers living in Giugliano ( Campania , Italy ) , an area at increased risk of PCDD and PCDF exposure caused by recent and serious open-air waste-combustion accidents .
Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in milk samples were also studied .
Breast milk was also monitored in two cities in northern Italy , Milan and Piacenza , which were selected as controls .
Other variables , such as diet and age of the mothers , were also studied .
PCDD/F and PCB levels and congener profiles in breast-milk samples were similar in all these cities , though total PCDD/F and DL-PCB TEQs in samples from Giugliano were significantly lower than those in Milan and Piacenza ( 8.65 pg WHO-TEQ in Giugliano vs. 11.0 and 9.94 pg WHO-TEQ in Milan and Piacenza respectively ) .
Thus no direct correlations were found between PCDD/F and PCB levels in breast milk and the suspected increased exposure through open-air waste combustion in Giugliano .
Diet did not seem to affect PCDD/F and PCB levels , whereas a significant correlation was observed between the mother's age and an increased concentration of PCDDs/Fs and PCBs in milk .
Comparison of these findings with those of previous surveys in Italy in 2000-2001 showed a marked reduction of PCDD/F ( about 60% ) and DL-PCB ( about 20% ) levels in breast milk occurring over the last 10 years .
This might well be a result of well functioning legislation , for example European Directives on of the reduction of the emission limits of PCDDs/Fs and PCBs from waste incineration set by EU Directive 2000/76/EC implemented in 2000 , or Commission Regulations such as ( EC ) No. 466/2001 and 1881/2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs .
