Geologically enriched environments may contain high concentrations of some metals .
In areas where industrial exposures remain superficial , children may be exposed to these geological metals through soil , drinking water and consumption of food locally grown .
The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of soil , water and food consumption to cadmium ( Cd ) , chromium ( Cr ) , copper ( Cu ) , zinc ( Zn ) , cobalt ( Co ) and titanium ( Ti ) body burden of children in the geologically metal rich coastal zone of Lake Victoria , Kenya .
We evaluated the relationship between the metal body burden of children by analyzing the hair samples and the estimated metal intake through exposure to soil , drinking water , and food consumption .
The body burdens of all metals in children at the exposed sites were high , suggesting environmental exposure .
Most of the foods consumed resulted in metal intake below the maximum recommended daily intake .
However , the net contribution of all food items jointly exceeded the recommended maximum daily intake at some of the exposure sites .
Our results further demonstrated that the highest intake of metals occurred via ingestion of high quantities of the cyprinid fish Rastrineobola argentea .
Positive linear relationships between the metal body burden in children and estimated daily intake were observed for Cd , Cr , Ti in children consuming high quantity of R. argentea ; for Zn and Co in children highly exposed to soils and consuming high quantity of Brassica oleraceae , while Co burden in the body was associated with high consumption of maize meal .
This study demonstrated that exposure to soil and consumption of higher quantities of some foods contributed to the increased metal body burdens of children in a geologically exposed region .
