As part of a survey conducted by the Central Agricultural Office of Hungary , 67 food samples including beverages were taken from 57 food industrial and catering companies , 75% of them being small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) .
Moreover , 40% of the SMEs were micro entities .
Water used for food processing was simultaneously sampled .
The arsenic ( As ) content of solid food stuff was determined by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry after dry ashing .
Food stuff with high water content and water samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .
The As concentration exceeded 10 \u03bcg/L in 74% of the water samples taken from SMEs .
The As concentrations of samples with high water content and water used were linearly correlated .
Estimated As intake from combined exposure to drinking water and food of the population was on average 40% of the daily lower limit of WHO on the benchmark dose for a 0.5% increased incidence of lung cancer ( BMDL0.5 ) for As .
Five settlements had higher As intake than the BMDL0.5 .
Three of these settlements are situated in Csongr√°d county and the distance between them is less than 55 km .
The maximum As intake might be 3.8 \u03bcg/kg body weight .
