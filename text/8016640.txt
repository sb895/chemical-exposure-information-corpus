210Po and 210Pb concentrations in urine and hair samples from individuals working in different areas of the uranium industrial complex of PoÃ§os de Caldas ( Brazil ) have been determined and compared with a control group of occupationally unexposed individuals .
In the control group , smokers showed higher urinary excretion of these radionuclides .
Such difference could not be detected in the workers group , which showed an increase in urinary excretion of 210Po for the group working in the chemical laboratory .
Accumulation of 210Po and 210Pb in hair showed the same trends as for urinary excretion .
The workers group , with the exception of the office employees , showed a 210Po/210Pb ratio > 1 in hair .
