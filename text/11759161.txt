In this study we determined the concentrations of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TCPyr ) in urine samples from the general population .
TCPyr is a specific metabolite of the organophosphorus pesticides chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl .
By the introduction of a new sensitive analytical method a limit of quantification ( LOQ ) of 0.1 microgram per litre urine could be achieved , a tenfold improvement of recent methods .
Extraction of TCPyr from the urine and the clean up process were carried out by automatic steam distillation .
Separation and quantitative analysis were performed using capillary gas chromatography and mass selective detection in selected ion monitoring mode .
The excretion of TCPyr was studied by analysing spontaneous urine samples from 5 women and 45 men between the ages of 22 and 57 ( median : 40 years ) living in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( Germany ) who were not occupationally exposed to organophosporus pesticides .
TCPyr was detected in all specimens and the concentrations were quantified .
The median excretion was 1.4 micrograms/l ( range : 0.12 to 124.8 micrograms/l ) , the 95th percentile 11.3 micrograms/l .
Under the worst case assumption that all TCPyr measured in urine originated from the intake of intact pesticides and not ( less toxic ) breakdown products , a TCPyr concentration of 1.4 micrograms/l urine corresponds to a daily intake of approximately 2.5 micrograms chlorpyrifos/chlorpyrifos-methyl .
The intake at the 95th percentile would be about 23 micrograms chlorpyrifos/chlorpyrifos-methyl per day .
According to FAO/WHO the acceptable daily intake ( ADI ) is 10 micrograms per kg bodyweight and day for both chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl .
