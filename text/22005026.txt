BACKGROUND Benzene is an established leukemogen at high exposure levels .
Although low-level benzene exposure is widespread and may induce oxidative damage , no mechanistic biomarkers are available to detect biological dysfunction at low doses .
OBJECTIVES Our goals were to determine in a large multicenter cross-sectional study whether low-level benzene is associated with increased blood mitochondrial DNA copy number ( mtDNAcn , a biological oxidative response to mitochondrial DNA damage and dysfunction ) and to explore potential links between mtDNAcn and leukemia-related epigenetic markers .
METHODS We measured blood relative mtDNAcn by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 341 individuals selected from various occupational groups with low-level benzene exposures ( > 100 times lower than the Occupational Safety and Health Administration/European Union standards ) and 178 referents from three Italian cities ( Genoa , Milan , Cagliari ) .
RESULTS In each city , benzene-exposed participants showed higher mtDNAcn than referents : mtDNAcn was 0.90 relative units in Genoa bus drivers and 0.75 in referents ( p = 0.019 ) ; 0.90 in Milan gas station attendants , 1.10 in police officers , and 0.75 in referents ( p-trend = 0.008 ) ; 1.63 in Cagliari petrochemical plant workers , 1.25 in referents close to the plant , and 0.90 in referents farther from the plant ( p-trend = 0.046 ) .
Using covariate-adjusted regression models , we estimated that an interquartile range increase in personal airborne benzene was associated with percent increases in mtDNAcn equal to 10.5% in Genoa ( p = 0.014 ) , 8.2% ( p = 0.008 ) in Milan , 7.5% in Cagliari ( p = 0.22 ) , and 10.3% in all cities combined ( p < 0.001 ) .
Using methylation data available for the Milan participants , we found that mtDNAcn was associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation ( -2.41% ; p = 0.007 ) and p15 hypermethylation ( +15.95% , p = 0.008 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Blood MtDNAcn was increased in persons exposed to low benzene levels , potentially reflecting mitochondrial DNA damage and dysfunction .
