The focus of the present study was on the relationship between Hong Kong male subfertility and fish consumption .
Mercury concentrations found in the hair of 159 Hong Kong males aged 25-72 ( mean age = 37 years ) was positively correlated with age and was significantly higher in Hong Kong subjects than in European and Finnish subjects ( 1.2 and 2.1 ppm , respectively ) .
Mercury in the hair of 117 subfertile Hong Kong males ( 4.5 ppm , P < 0.05 ) was significantly higher than mercury levels found in hair collected from 42 fertile Hong Kong males ( 3.9 ppm ) .
Subfertile males had approx. 40% more mercury in their hair than fertile males of similar age .
Although there were only 35 female subjects , they had significantly lower levels of hair mercury than males in similar age groups .
Overall , males had mercury levels that were 60% higher than females .
Hair samples collected from 16 vegetarians living in Hong Kong ( vegans that had consumed no fish , shellfish or meat for at least the last 5 years ) had very low levels of mercury .
Their mean hair mercury concentration was only 0.38 ppm .
