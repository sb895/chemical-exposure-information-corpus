Toxic metals are one of the significant groups of chemical contaminants that humans are exposed to by oral , inhalation , and dermal routes .
Exposure to these chemicals begins with intrauterine life and continues during lactation period at the first years of life .
Breastfeeding has a much more special place than other nutrition options for infants .
However , when possibility of contaminant transfer by breast milk is considered , its safety and quality is essential .
Regarding infant and mother health and limited number of information on this field in Turkey , measuring contamination levels in breast milk is important .
Therefore , in the present study , lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , nickel ( Ni ) , and arsenic ( As ) levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry in 64 breast milk samples obtained from mothers from Ankara , Turkey .
Pb and Ni levels in breast milk samples were found to be 391.45±269.01 \u03bcg/l and 43.94±33.82 \u03bcg/l ( mean ± SD ) , respectively .
Cd was found only in one of 64 samples , and the level was 4.62 \u03bcg/l .
As level was below the limit of quantification ( LOQ , 7.6 \u03bcg/l ) in all samples .
These findings will accurately direct strategies and solutions of protection against contaminants in order to reduce their levels in biological fluids .
