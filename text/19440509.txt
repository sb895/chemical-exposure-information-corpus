BACKGROUND Air pollution is associated with respiratory symptoms , lung function decrements , and hospitalizations .
However , there is little information about the influence of air pollution on lung injury .
OBJECTIVE In this study we investigated acute effects of air pollution on pulmonary function and airway oxidative stress and inflammation in asthmatic children .
METHODS We studied 182 children with asthma , 9-14 years of age , for 4 weeks .
Daily ambient concentrations of sulfur dioxide , nitrogen dioxide , ozone , and particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM(2.5) ) were monitored from two stations .
Once a week we measured spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( FeNO ) , and determined thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) and 8-isoprostane--two oxidative stress markers--and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) in breath condensate .
We tested associations using mixed-effects regression models , adjusting for confounding variables .
RESULTS Interquartile-range increases in 3-day average SO2 ( 5.4 ppb ) , NO2 ( 6.8 ppb ) , and PM(2.5) ( 5.4 microg/m3 ) were associated with decreases in forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity , with changes being -3.1% [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , -5.8 to -0.3 ] , -2.8% ( 95% CI , -4.8 to -0.8 ) , and -3.0% ( 95% CI , -4.7 to -1.2 ) , respectively .
SO2 , NO2 , and PM(2.5) were associated with increases in TBARS , with changes being 36.2% ( 95% CI , 15.7 to 57.2 ) , 21.8% ( 95% CI , 8.2 to 36.0 ) , and 24.8% ( 95% CI , 10.8 to 39.4 ) , respectively .
Risk estimates appear to be larger in children not taking corticosteroids than in children taking corticosteroids .
O3 ( 5.3 ppb ) was not associated with health end points .
FeNO , 8-isoprostane , and IL-6 were not associated with air pollutants .
CONCLUSION Air pollution may increase airway oxidative stress and decrease small airway function of asthmatic children .
Inhaled corticosteroids may reduce oxidative stress and improve airway function .
