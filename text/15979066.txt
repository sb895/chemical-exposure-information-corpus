Great Lakes ( GL ) sport fish consumption is a potential route of exposure for environmentally persistent organochlorine contaminants , which may have human health effects .
In this report , relationships are explored among individual congeners in a large cohort of frequent and infrequent GL sport fish consumers .
Blood samples were obtained in 1993-1995 and analyzed for 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene ( DDE ) and for 62 noncoplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , 4 coplanar PCBs , 8 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin ( dioxin ) , and10 dibenzofuran ( furan ) congeners .
All GL fish eaters and referents had detectable levels of DDE , total noncoplanar PCBs , total coplanar PCBs , total dioxins , and total furans .
Noncoplanar PCBs were higher in GL sport fish consumers than in a referent population from the same geographic area , were associated with GL sport-caught fish ( GLSCF ) consumption , and varied significantly by Great Lake .
DDE , lower chlorinated dioxin and furan toxic equivalents ( TEQs ) , and coplanar PCB TEQs were positively associated with noncoplanar PCBs but were not associated with GL sport fish consumption independent of PCB level .
Highly chlorinated dioxin and furan congener TEQs were not significantly associated with noncoplanar PCBs or GL sport fish consumption , suggesting that participants were acquiring some of these TEQs from a source other than GLSCF .
In epidemiologic studies , it may be important to include populations with higher organochlorine exposures as well as background exposures and to consider the effects of individual congeners or mixtures of congeners on health outcomes .
