Breastfeeding has been associated with an advantage to infant neurobehavioral development , possibly in part due to essential nutrients in breast milk .
However , breast milk may be contaminated by environmental neurotoxicants , such as methylmercury .
In the Faroe Islands , where maternal consumption of pilot whale may cause transfer of marine toxicants into breast milk , a cohort of 1022 consecutive singleton births was generated during 1986-87 .
Methylmercury exposure was assessed from mercury concentrations in cord blood and in the hair of the child at age 12 months , and the duration of breastfeeding was recorded .
At approximately 7 years of age , 917 ( 90% ) of the children underwent detailed neurobehavioral examination .
After adjustment for confounders , breastfeeding was associated with only marginally better neuropsychological performance on most tests .
These associations were robust even after adjustment for cord-blood and hair mercury concentration at age 1 year .
Thus , in this cohort of children with a relatively high prenatal toxicant exposure and potential exposure to neurotoxicants through breast milk , breastfeeding was associated with less benefits on neurobehavioral development than previously published studies though not associated with a deficit in neuropsychological performance at age 7 .
Although the advantage may be less , Faroese women can still safely breastfeed their children .
