Flame retardant dechlorane plus ( DP ) and several polybrominated diphenylether ( PBDE ) congeners have been measured in 87 human milk samples collected in two Canadian cities : Kingston and Sherbrooke .
The levels of PBDEs in human milk ( mean ( median ) , ng g(-1) lipid weight=10 ( 5.9 ) , 4.1 ( 2.8 ) , 3.0 ( 1.6 ) , 5.12 ( 1.6 ) , and 15 ( ND ) for BDE-47 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-153 , and BDE-209 , respectively ) were comparable to those reported in Europe , U.S.A. and China .
The levels of DP , with a mean value of 0.98 ng g(-1) and a median value of 0.60 ng g(-1) ( lipid weight ) , were two to ten times lower than those of concurrently measured major PBDEs including BDE-209 .
While there is little difference in the levels of measured contaminants in milk samples collected from the two cities , the contaminants levels in human milk show , indicated by Principal Components Analysis , that DP , deca-BDE , and penta-BDE come from three distinct sources .
The mean and median isomer ratio values of DP in milk were 0.67 and 0.69 , respectively , very similar to that of DP commercial products .
