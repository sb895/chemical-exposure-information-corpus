Human exposure to methylmercury occurs mainly via consumption of fish .
The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of freshwater fish consumption on mercury levels in hair , blood , urine , and end-exhaled air .
Twenty subjects without dental amalgam fillings were recruited from sport-fishing societies .
They ranged in age from 61 to 87 yr .
Six individuals ate freshwater fish at least once a week and were categorized as high consumers .
Eight individuals were classified as medium consumers and ate freshwater fish at least once a month but less than once a week .
Six individuals were categorized as low consumers and had not eaten freshwater fish in the past 3 mo .
Among the high consumers , median concentrations of mercury were 8.6 microg/L in blood , 2.4 microg/g in hair , 10 pg/L in end-exhaled air , and 1.1 microg/g creatinine in urine .
The relationship between freshwater fish consumption and mercury was significant in all biological media .
The high-consumption group had much higher mercury levels in blood ( 9-fold ) , hair ( 7-fold ) , alveolar air ( 3-fold ) , and urine ( 15-fold ) than the low-consumption group .
The latter finding may be explained by demethylation of methylmercury in the body .
The ratio between mercury concentration in blood and hair was 1:270 .
This implies that the typical blood-hair ratio of 1:250 , specified by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in 1990 , is valid also for exposure to low amounts of methylmercury .
