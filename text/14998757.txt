Children of farmworkers can be exposed to pesticides through multiple pathways , including agricultural take-home and drift as well as residential applications .
Because farmworker families often live in poor-quality housing , the exposure from residential pesticide use may be substantial .
We measured eight locally reported agricultural pesticides and 13 pesticides commonly found in U.S. houses in residences of 41 farmworker families with at least one child < 7 years of age in western North Carolina and Virginia .
Wipe samples were taken from floor surfaces , toys , and children's hands .
We also collected interview data on possible predictors of pesticide presence , including characteristics of the household residents , cleaning practices , and characteristics of the home .
All families were Spanish-speaking , primarily from Mexico .
Results indicate that six agricultural and 11 residential pesticides were found in the homes , with agricultural , residential , or both present in 95% of homes sampled .
In general , residential pesticides were more commonly found .
Presence of both types of pesticides on the floor was positively associated with detection on toys or hands .
Agricultural pesticide detection was associated with housing adjacent to agricultural fields .
Residential pesticide detection was associated with houses judged difficult to clean .
Although the likelihood of agricultural pesticide exposure has been considered high for farmworker families , these results indicate that residential pesticide use and exposure in this population merit further study .
