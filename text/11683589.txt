The interrelationship of blood lead ( BPb ) , activity of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase ( ALAD ) , erythrocyte protoporphyrin ( EP ) , blood cadmium ( BCd ) , serum copper ( SCu ) , serum zinc ( SZn ) , serum selenium ( SSe ) , hematocrit ( Hct ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , age , smoking habits , and alcohol consumption to blood pressure was examined in 154 Croatian male subjects 19-53 years of age .
None of the subjects had been occupationally exposed to metals , or used any medication that could influence blood pressure or metal metabolism .
The median and range values were : BPb , 57 ( 25-254 ) microg/L ; ALAD , 51.9 ( 22.8-96.4 ) European units ; EP , 0.68 ( 0.38-1.68 ) micromol/L erythrocytes ; BCd , 0.83 ( 0.21-11.93 ) microg/L ; SCu , 1113 ( 763-1662 ) microg/L ; SZn , 961 ( 734-1213 ) microg/L ; SSe , 73.6 ( 44.2-106.9 ) microg/L ; systolic blood pressure , 131 ( 105-165 ) mm Hg ; and diastolic blood pressure , 94 ( 71-112 ) mm Hg .
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly correlated with an increase in BMI ( P<0.0005 and P<0.0001 , respectively ) , EP ( P<0.0002 and P<0.002 , respectively ) , and BPb ( P<0.005 and P<0.01 , respectively ) .
After adjusting for potential confounding variables by multiple regression , an increase in systolic blood pressure was significantly predictive by BMI ( P<0.0005 ) and log BPb ( P<0.02 ) and inversely by log BPb*SSe interaction term ( P<0.007 ) , or alternatively by EP ( P<0.0001 ) , BMI ( P<0.001 ) , alcohol ( P<0.02 ) , and Hct ( P<0.05 ) .
An increase in diastolic blood pressure was significantly predictive by BMI ( P<10(-5) ) , log BPb ( P<0.04 ) , and alcohol ( P=0.05 ) and inversely by log BPb*SSe interaction term ( P<0.0007 ) , or alternatively by BMI ( P<0.0001 ) , EP ( P<0.002 ) , alcohol ( P<0.004 ) , and Hct ( P<0.04 ) and inversely by smoking ( P<0.04 ) .
With respect to the EP range in the study population , an increase of 27 mm Hg in systolic and 14 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure was found .
The study results indicate a significant Pb-related increase in blood pressure , particularly within the low-level Pb exposure range ( BPb of 25-75 microg/L , and/or EP of 0.4-1.0 micromol/L erythrocytes ) .
