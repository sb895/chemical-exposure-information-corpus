BACKGROUND Methylmercury ( MeHg ) exposure has been linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) .
Paraoxonase 1 ( PON1 ) , an enzyme located in the high-density-lipoprotein ( HDL ) fraction of blood lipids , may protect against CHD by metabolizing toxic oxidized lipids associated with low-density liproprotein and HDL .
MeHg has been shown to inhibit PON1 activity in vitro , but this effect has not been studied in human populations.Objectives : This study was conducted to determine whether blood mercury levels are linked to decreased plasma PON1 activities in Inuit people who are highly exposed to MeHg through their seafood-based diet .
METHODS We measured plasma PON1 activity using a fluorogenic substrate and blood concentrations of mercury and selenium by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in 896 Inuit adults .
Sociodemographic , anthropometric , clinical , dietary , and lifestyle variables as well as PON1 gene variants ( rs705379 , rs662 , rs854560 ) were considered as possible confounders or modifiers of the mercury-PON1 relation in multivariate analyses.Results : In a multiple regression model adjusted for age , HDL cholesterol levels , omega-3 fatty acid content of erythrocyte membranes , and PON1 variants , blood mercury concentrations were inversely associated with PON1 activities [ \u03b2-coefficient = -0.063 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , -0.091 to -0.035 ; p < 0.001 ] , whereas blood selenium concentrations were positively associated with PON1 activities ( \u03b2-coefficient = 0.067 ; 95% CI , 0.045-0.088 ; p < 0.001 ) .
We found no interaction between blood mercury levels and PON1 genotypes .
CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that MeHg exposure exerts an inhibitory effect on PON1 activity , which seems to be offset by selenium intake .
