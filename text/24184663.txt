Low molecular weight cyclic volatile methylsiloxanes ( cVMSs ) are widely employed as emollients and carrier solvents in personal care formulations in order to acquire desired performance benefits owing to their distinctive physicochemical properties .
Under current European legislation cosmetic ingredients such as cVMSs are required to be labeled on the product package only qualitatively , while for the assessment of environmental and consumer exposure quantitative information is needed .
The aim of this study was therefore to measure concentrations of three cVMSs , namely octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane ( D4 ) , decamethylcyclopentasiloxane ( D5 ) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane ( D6 ) in 51 cosmetics and personal care products ( C&PCPs ) that are currently available on the European market .
The list of selected articles comprised a variety of hair and sun care products , skin creams and lotions , deodorants including antiperspirants , liquid foundations and a toothpaste .
The target compounds were extracted from the products with different organic solvents dependent on the product matrix , followed by gas chromatography analysis with flame ionization detection ( GC-FID ) .
D5 was the predominant cVMS with the highest mean and median concentrations in all the C&PCP categories .
The median concentrations of D5 , D6 and D4 were 142 , 2.3 and 0.053 mg/g in deodorants/antiperspirants ( n = 11 ) ; 44.6 , 30.0mg/g and below the limit of quantification ( <LOQ ; LOQ for D4 = 0.00071 mg/g ) in cosmetics ( n = 5 ) ; 8.4 , 0.32 mg/g and <LOQ in skin care ( n = 16 ) ; 9.6 , 0.18 and 0.0055 mg/g in hair care ( n = 10 ) ; and , 34.8 , 0.53 and 0.0085 mg/g in sun care ( n = 8 ) products , respectively .
The calculated median aggregate daily dermal exposure to D4 and D5 from multiple C&PCPs was approximately 100 times lower than the current NOAEL derived from chronic inhalation rat studies .
