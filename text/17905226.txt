Mercury is a hazardous metal that has become an important issue of environmental contamination in Amazon areas .
Human intoxication by mercury causes sensory deficits , motor dysfunction , delayed psychomotor development , genotoxicity , and several other health problems .
One of the major cellular mechanisms of mercury toxicity is the oxidative stress which may lead to membrane peroxidation and generation of reactive oxygen species .
The antioxidant defense , which includes scavenger compounds such as glutathione and antioxidant enzymes such as catalase , might prevent these injuries to occur .
Thus , the objective of this work was to evaluate hair mercury levels and the strength of antioxidant defenses , evaluated by glutathione levels and catalase activity in the blood of exposed and non-exposed women living in Amazon populations .
For each location , no statistically significant difference ( P<0.05 ) was detected for age versus mercury content .
However , women from populations under the influence of gold mining activity exhibit high mercury levels in hair samples , above the tolerance limit accepted by the World Health Organization .
In addition , a significant correlation was found between high mercury content , high glutathione level , and lower catalase activity .
These data suggest that chronic mercury intoxication may deplete antioxidant enzymatic activity , which can be used as an important peripheral marker .
Knowledge originated by this monitoring will better assist the development of preventive strategies and governmental actions against the problem of mercury contamination .
