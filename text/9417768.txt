Quantitative examination of major pathways and routes of exposure to pesticides is essential for determining human risk .
The current study was conducted in two apartments and examines the accumulation of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in childrens ' toys after the time suggested for reentry after application .
It has been established for the first time that a semivolatile pesticide will accumulate on and in toys and other sorbant surfaces in a home via a two-phase physical process that continues for at least 2 weeks postapplication .
A summation of the above for a 3-6-year-old child yielded an estimated nondietary total dose of 208 microg/kg/day .
Potential exposure from the inhalation pathway was negligible , while dermal and nondietary oral doses from playing with toys contributed to 39 and 61% of the total dose , respectively .
If children with high frequency mouthing behavior are considered as candidates for acute exposure to chlorpyrifos residues , the estimated acute dose could be as high as 356 microg/kg/day .
Routine reapplication of pesticides could lead to continued accumulation in toys and other sorbant surfaces , e.g. , pillows , with large sorbant reservoirs , which can become a long-term source of exposure to a child .
Estimates of a child's nondietary exposure to chlorpyrifos associated with toys and other sorbant surfaces for a period of 1 week following application appear to be of public health concern , and studies of actual childhood exposure from this pathway are warranted in the home environment .
The above information should be used to determine if current procedures for postapplication reentry are sufficient and to evaluate the need for procedures to store frequently used household toys , pillows , and other sorbant objects during insecticidal application .
