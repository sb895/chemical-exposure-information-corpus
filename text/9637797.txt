Pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) is a pesticide that was once widely used for wood preservation .
Commercial PCP contained impurities including higher chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( CDDs ) and chlorinated dibenzofurans ( CDFs ) .
We investigated the effects of occupational exposure to PCP and its CDD and CDF contaminants on the skin , liver , porphyrin metabolism , and central and peripheral nervous systems .
In 1986 we conducted a medical survey of 366 workers who had been engaged in the production of PCP at a single plant between 1938 and 1978 .
The referent group consisted of 303 workers from the same plant who were not exposed to these or related compounds .
Exposure was determined from computerized personnel records .
The medical survey included an administered questionnaire , medical record review , physical examination by dermatologists , internists , and neurologists , and analysis of 24-hr urine for quantitative porphyrins among other tests .
In this paper we present the results of analyses of the general health , chloracne , and porphyrin metabolism end points .
The general health status of PCP workers was similar to unexposed workers , but 17.8% of PCP workers had evidence of current or past chloracne .
PCP workers with chloracne had significantly higher mean urinary excretion of coproporphyrins ( 117. 0 vs. 90.6 microg/24 hr ) than unexposed workers after controlling for potential confounders .
Workers with chloracne who had worked with both PCP and polychlorinated biphenyls had significantly higher mean urinary excretions of hepta- , penta- , and coproporphyrins than unexposed workers .
We conclude that occupational exposure to PCP is associated with chloracne and biochemical abnormalities which may persist years after exposure .
