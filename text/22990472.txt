In the state of West Bengal in India , over 26 million individuals are exposed to arsenic via drinking water .
Dermatological , non-dermatological disorders and cancers are associated with arsenic toxicity .
Of late , there has been a decrease in the arsenic concentration in drinking water owing to governmental efforts , raising the possibility of remediation .
A cross-sectional study was conducted , where 189 arsenicosis and 171 unexposed individuals were recruited at two time points , ( 2005-06 and 2010-11 ) with concomitant decrease in the level of arsenic exposure via drinking water in the arsenicosis group in 2010-11 .
Parameters studied included dermatological , non-dermatological health status and cytogenetic damage .
Decrease of arsenic exposure ( 190.1 \u03bcg/l to 37.94 \u03bcg/l ) resulted in significant decline in the number of individuals having dermatological disorders ( P<0.01 ) and in the severity of each dermatological outcome ( P<0.0001 ) .
Micronucleus formation in urothelial cells and lymphocytes decreased significantly ( P<0.001 ) .
However , there was a significant ( P<0.001 ) rise in the incidence of each of the non-dermatological diseases , that is , peripheral neuropathy , conjunctivitis and respiratory distress over the period .
Thirteen ( 6.87% ) of the initially recruited arsenicosis individuals died of cancer , in this period .
Remediation by arsenic-safe drinking water can reduce dermatological manifestations and cytogenetic insult ; but is unable to counter the non-dermatological symptoms .
