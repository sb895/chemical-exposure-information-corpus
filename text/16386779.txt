Contamination levels of persistent organochlorines ( OCs ) such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , biphenyls ( PCBs ) , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites ( DDTs ) , hexachlorocyclohexane isomers ( HCHs ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , and chlordane compounds ( CHLs ) was examined in human breast milk collected during 2001-2004 from Fukuoka prefecture in Japan .
The concentrations of OCs such as dioxins and related compounds , DDTs , CHLs and HCB in human breast milk from primiparae were comparable to or slightly higher than the data obtained during 1998 , indicating that the levels of these contaminants in Japanese human breast milk have not decreased since 1998 and Japanese are continuously exposed to these chemicals , presumably via fish intake .
In addition , OC levels in human breast milk from primiparae were significantly higher than those from multiparae , implying elimination of OCs via lactation .
Furthermore , significant positive correlations were observed between levels of OCs in human breast milk and the age of primiparae .
These results indicate that the mothers with higher age may transfer higher amounts of OCs to the first infant than to the infants born afterwards through breast-feeding , and hence the first born children might be at higher risk by OCs .
