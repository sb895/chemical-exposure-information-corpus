The cement dust is one of the causes of pollution in the environment .
In the present study , the cadmium concentrations of soil and plant specimens taken from a rural area exposed to cement factory emissions were determined and also the blood concentrations and sensitivity conditions in humans residing in this rural area were investigated .
The 108 soil ( 36 for control ) and plant specimens were collected from eight different directions of the cement plant located in Cukurhisar town in Eski\u015fehir city .
Blood samples of the individuals residing in this area were taken from 258 subjects ( 258 for control ) following a physical examination , and patch tests were also applied .
The results show that the cadmium concentrations of the soil and plant specimens taken from different places in different directions of the factory were higher than in the control areas .
The physical examination of subjects did not reveal results different from those of the control group except for the diagnosis of contact dermatitis .
The analysis of venous blood samples showed that cadmium concentrations were found to be within the reference values given for both groups , but higher in the subjects ( p<0.001 ) .
According to the results of patch tests , sensitivity to cadmium was found to be more frequent for the subject group than the control group ( p<0.05 ) .
Those results show that , although clinical tools revealed no toxic effects for the subject , except contact dermatitis , the cement plant increases cadmium pollution on the surrounding environment .
