A baseline for exposure to organochlorine and metal contaminants has been established for mothers and newborns in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut areas of Arctic Canada .
Maternal and umbilical cord blood plasma organochlorine levels are described for Inuit , Dene , Métis , Caucasian and Other non-Aboriginal participants .
Overall , 523 women volunteered to participate by giving their written informed consent between May 1994 and June 1999 , resulting in the collection of 386 maternal blood samples , 407 cord blood samples and 351 maternal/cord pairs .
Nearly half of all the participants regularly smoked cigarettes , including 77% of the Inuit participants .
Maternal and cord results are presented for PCBs ( as Aroclor 1260 and 14 congeners ) and organochlorine pesticides , including p,p'-DDT , p,p'-DDE , beta-hexachlorocyclohexane ( beta-HCH ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , cis and trans nonachlor , heptachlor epoxide , oxychlordane , mirex , dieldrin and toxaphene .
Maternal PCB levels ( as Aroclor 1260 ) averaged 4.42 ( +/-9.03 ) microg/l in Inuit , which was 3.3 times higher than those found in Dene/Métis , and 3.4 times higher than levels in Caucasians .
Mean DDE levels were 2.8 times higher in the Other non-Aboriginal group ( Chinese , Filipino , East Indian and multiple ethnicity ) than in the Inuit group , at 3.99 microg/l and 1.42 microg/l , respectively .
Cord blood PCB levels ( as Aroclor 1260 ) averaged 1.16 ( +/-2.42 ) microg/l for Inuit participants , which was 3.3-4 fold higher than the other ethnic groups .
PCBs , p,p'-DDE and hexachlorobenzene were detected in all maternal samples , and p,p'-DDE was detected in all cord samples .
Regression coefficients for maternal/cord pairs are presented for selected organochlorines .
Other results from this study , including maternal and cord metals data , will be presented elsewhere .
