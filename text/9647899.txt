The long-term health effects of human exposure to polybrominated biphenyls are not known .
In this nested case-control study , we evaluated the association between site-specific cancer risk and serum polybrominated biphenyl levels among a Michigan cohort accidentally exposed to polybrominated biphenyls in 1973 .
The Michigan Department of Public Health has followed 3,899 people through 1993 , among whom 195 primary cancers were identified in 187 persons .
Controls were 696 randomly selected cancer-free individuals who were frequency matched to cases by sex and age ( in 5-year strata ) .
Baseline serum polybrominated biphenyl levels were measured using standard methods .
We found an increasing dose-response relation for digestive system cancer risk with higher serum polybrominated biphenyl category [ 4-20 parts per billion ( ppb ) , 21-50 ppb , and > 50 ppb ] after adjustment for age , family cancer history , cigarette smoking , alcohol drinking , and baseline serum polychlorinated biphenyl level .
Adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) for each category were 8.23 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.27-53.3 ] , 12.3 ( 95% CI = 0.80-191 ) , and 22.9 ( 95% CI = 1.34-392 ) , respectively .
Univariate analysis for polybrominated biphenyl level and lymphoma risk also showed a dose-response relation , with corresponding ORs of 3.24 ( 95% CI = 0.24-95.9 ) , 20.5 ( 95% CI = 1.51-608 ) , and 32.6 ( 95% CI = 3.33-861 ) .
