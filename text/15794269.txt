The aim of this study was to find out if children's exposure to tobacco smoke in the apartments influences the lead and cadmium content and the values of Pb/Ca and Cd/Ca ratios in hard tissues of their deciduous teeth .
Material consisted of 71 shed deciduous teeth ; 37 from children in the age of 6 to 13 years additionally exposed to tobacco smoke in the apartments and 34 from children in the same age , whose apartments were free of tobacco smoke .
Lead , cadmium and calcium content was determined by means of flame atomic absorption spectrometry .
Deciduous teeth of children additionally exposed to tobacco smoke in the apartments exhibited higher lead and cadmium content and higher values of Pb/Ca and Cd/Ca ratios , which indicated significant accumulation of these metals , when compared to deciduous teeth of children whose apartments were free of tobacco smoke .
