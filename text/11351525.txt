Twelve polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were simultaneously measured in indoor and outdoor air of eight homes in Hangzhou , China in both summer and autumn in 1999 .
It was observed that the sum of PAHs concentrations in indoor air were ranged from 1.418 to 20.466 micrograms/m3 in summer and from 3.897 to 29.852 micrograms/m3 in autumn ; the corresponding concentrations in outdoor air were between 1.380 and 20.468 micrograms/m3 in the summer and between 2.721 and 30.678 micrograms/m3 in autumn .
The PAHs concentrations in indoor air generally exceeded that in the corresponding outdoor air .
It was indicated that the two- , three- , and four-ring PAHs were predominantly in vapor phase , while the five-ring PAHs were primarily associated with the particulate phase .
The fraction of PAHs in vapor phase will increase with the increase of temperature .
Among the 12 PAHs , naphthalene was the most abundant PAHs found in indoor and outdoor air .
Both in summer and autumn , it contributed more than 60% to the sum of PAHs .
Because of the different functions and ventilation conditions , the concentrations of PAHs in the rooms were bedroom > kitchen > living room > balcony .
By the contrast of BaP concentrations in smoker and nonsmoker's homes , we know that smoking in indoors could contribute 67% of BaP to the homes .
