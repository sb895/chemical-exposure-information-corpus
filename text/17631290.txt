Risks from mercury and other contaminants in fish for a large Columbia River dataset are evaluated in this paper for a range of consumption rates .
Extensive ethnohistorical , nutritional , recent ethnographic surveys , and other documentation was reviewed to confirm previous determinations that the traditional subsistence fish consumption rate is 500 pounds per capita annually , or 620 g per day ( gpd ) .
Lower comtemporary consumption rates for other population subsets are also discussed .
The causes of the current suppression of fish consumption are discussed and the cultural , educational , social , and trade and economic impacts of the loss of fish are considered .
Action levels for mercury for riverine Tribes in the Columbia Basin are suggested at 0.1 ppm or less based on the combined risk from mercury plus other contaminants , the higher fish consumption rates , the existing cultural deficit due to loss of salmon and other stressors , the health benefits of fish , and the cultural and economic importance of fish .
The goal of fish advisories is to reduce fish consumption even further , which shifts the burden of avoiding risk to the very people who already bear the burdens of contaminant exposure , socio-economic impacts and cultural loss .
However , because Tribal communities often do not have the choice of giving up more food , income , religion , culture , and heritage in order to avoid contamination , they are forced into choosing between culture and health .
Many tribal members choose to incur chemical risk rather than giving up their culture and religion .
We believe that lowering the action level for mercury is part of the federal fiduciary responsibility to American Indian Tribes .
