In total , 45 adult women in Manila , the Philippines , volunteered to participate in the study by offering peripheral blood samples and 24-h total food duplicate samples .
In addition , they offered raw ( uncooked ) rice as well as wheat flour and maize starch from the kitchen .
Lead ( Pb ) and cadmium ( Cd ) in food duplicates and blood samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after homogenization ( when necessary ) and wet-ashing .
The consumption of rice , wheat and maize was calculated by weighing each food item in the duplicates taking advantage of the food composition tables .
The dietary exposure level of the women was 11 micrograms Pb/day and 14 micrograms Cd/day , and the levels of Pb and Cd in their blood were 37 ng Pb/ml and 0.47 ng Cd/ml .
There is a subtle age-dependent increase in the dietary burden of Pb and Cd and also in blood levels of Pb and Cd .
Rice accounted for 18 and 21% of dietary Pb and Cd intake , respectively and cereals ( i.e. rice , wheat and maize in combination ) accounted for 24% both for Pb and Cd .
The calculation from the published data on air quality in Manila suggested that another and yet a greater source of Pb burden was Pb in atmospheric air which may account for 85% of total Pb uptake , whereas the amount of Cd in air was quite small ( i.e. < 10% of the total uptake ) .
