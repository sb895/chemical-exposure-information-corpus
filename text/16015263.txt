OBJECTIVE The effect of drinking deep-sea water on hair minerals was studied in patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome ( AEDS ) .
Study of hair minerals revealed an imbalance of essential minerals and an increase in toxic minerals in AEDS patients .
DESIGN After drinking deep-sea water ( Amami no Mizu ) for 6 months in AEDS patients , hair minerals ( essential minerals and toxic minerals ) , clinical evaluation of the skin symptoms were compared before drinking with after drinking .
SUBJECTS After obtaining informed consent , 33 patients ( mean age 26 y , range 1-50 y , 13 male and 20 female subjects ) with mild to moderate AEDS were enrolled .
RESULTS After drinking deep-sea water , the levels of the essential mineral , potassium ( K ) , were significantly decreased , while the levels of selenium ( Se ) increased .
On the other hand , drinking deep-sea water significantly decreased the levels of the toxic minerals , mercury and lead .
Moreover , after drinking deep-sea water , the skin symptoms were improved in 27 out of 33 patients .
CONCLUSION These results indicate that the mineral abnormalities/imbalance may be involved in the pathogenesis of AEDS , and that drinking deep-sea water may be useful in the treatment of AEDS .
