Acrylamide ( AA ) , a probable human carcinogen , is present in high-temperature-processed foods , and has frequently been detected in humans worldwide .
In the present study , the levels of a major AA metabolite , N-acetyl-S-(2-carbamoylethyl)-cysteine ( AAMA ) were measured in urine samples collected in two separate events with 3d interval from Korean children ( n=31 , 10-13 years old ) , and their diets were surveyed for 4d period prior to the second urine sampling .
Daily AA intake was estimated from AAMA urinary levels and the influence of food consumption on urinary AAMA levels was investigated .
The concentrations of metabolite AAMA in urine ranged between 15.4 and 196.3 ng/mL , with a median level of 68.1 ng/mL , and the levels varied by day considerably even in a given child .
Children who were exposed to environmental smoke at home exhibited significantly higher levels of AAMA in urine , suggesting the importance of passive smoking as a source of AA exposure among children .
Median ( 95th percentile ) values of daily AA intake in Korean children were 1.04 ( 2.47)\u03bcg/kgbodyweight/day , which is higher than those reported elsewhere .
After adjustment for gender , body mass index , and smoking status of family members , the consumptions of cracker and chocolate were identified to be significantly associated with the concentrations of AAMA in urine .
The result of this study will provide information useful for developing public health and safety management for AA .
