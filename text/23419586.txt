The construction in Constant√≠ ( Tarragona County , Catalonia ) of the first , and up till now the only hazardous waste incinerator ( HWI ) in Spain , finished in 1999 .
In this study , we measured the concentrations of a number of organic substances determined in blood and urine of the HWI workers .
Samples of 18 men and 9 women , classified according to their respective workplaces , were collected in 2011 , after approximately 12 years of regular operations in the facility .
The current results were compared with those of the baseline survey , as well as with the most recent surveys performed in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 .
Plasma analyses were carried out for hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs 28 , 52 , 101 , 138 , 153 , and 180 ) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) , while the levels of 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol ( DCP ) , 2,4,5- and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol ( TCP ) , pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) and 1-hydroxypyrene ( 1-HP ) were measured in urine samples .
In plasma , the mean concentrations were the following : 10.8\u03bcg/kg lipid for HCB ; 0.8\u03bcg/kg lipid for PCB28 ; 0.3\u03bcg/kg lipid for PCB52 ; 0.5\u03bcg/kg lipid for PCB101 ; 42.2\u03bcg/kg lipid for PCB138 ; 18.5\u03bcg/kg lipid for PCB153 , and 51.2\u03bcg/kg lipid for PCB180 .
For PCDD/Fs , the mean concentration was 4.6ng I-TEQ/kg lipid ( 4.7ng WHO-TEQ/kg lipid ) .
These levels , as well as those found in urine samples , are in agreement with the data of previous surveys performed in the same area .
The current results in HWI workers do not show any evident sign of occupational exposure to PCDD/Fs and other organic substances .
However , these results must be considered only as an indication of potential exposure , as the study presents notable limitations , such as the reduced number of participants and the lack of data relative to the air concentrations of chemicals .
Consequently , general conclusions cannot be derived and the results should not be used as a basis for the implementation of industrial hygiene measures in other HWIs .
