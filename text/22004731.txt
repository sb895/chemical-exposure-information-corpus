We measured the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and non-dioxin-like PCBs in paired samples of blood and breast milk collected from 67 secundiparas in Sapporo City , Japan , and combined this data with those of the 30 secundiparas previously measured .
The arithmetic mean total toxic equivalents ( TEQ-WHO ) concentrations of PCDDs , PCDFs , non-ortho PCBs , and mono-ortho PCBs in blood and breast milk of the 97 secundiparous subjects were 3.0-23 ( mean : 13 , median : 14 ) and 2.7-20 ( mean : 8.6 , median : 8.5 ) pg TEQ g(-1) lipid , respectively .
The sums of the concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners that were measured in the subjects ' blood and breast milk were 16-326 ( mean : 107 , median : 100 ) and 12-252 ( mean : 73 , median : 67 ) ng g(-1) lipid , respectively .
The partitioning ratios of individual congeners of PCDDs , PCDFs , dioxin-like PCBs , and non-dioxin-like PCBs from blood to breast milk in secundiparas were almost the same as those of primiparas that have been recently reported , suggesting that the partitioning ratios of these compounds from maternal blood to breast milk in women is little affected by delivery .
Furthermore , the partition of PCB congeners with chlorine at the 2- , 3- , 4'- , and 5-positions or the 2- , 4- , 4'- , and 5-positions of the biphenyl ring from the blood to the breast milk tended to occur at a higher level than that of other congeners .
In particular , the levels of tetraCB-74 and hexaCB-146 in the breast milk for both primiparous and secundiparous mothers were slightly higher than those in the blood .
