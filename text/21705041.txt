Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) are man-made fluoro-surfactants that are identified as global pollutants and can pose health risks to humans and wildlife .
Two aspects of risk assessment were conducted in this study , including exposure and response .
Exposure was estimated by using the concentrations of PFCs in fish and applying standard exposure factors .
Among different PFCs , PFOS , PFOA , PFNA , PFDA , PFUdA and PFTrDA were detected .
Total concentrations of PFC in fish ranged from 0.27-8.4 ng g(-1) to 0.37-8.7 ng g(-1) respectively in Hong Kong and Xiamen .
The calculated hazard ratio ( HR ) of PFOS for all fish was less than 1.0 .
However , the HR for mandarin fish in Hong Kong and bighead carp , grass carp and tilapia in Xiamen , had HR values of approximately 0.5 , indicating that frequent consumption of these 4 more contaminated fish species might pose an unacceptable risk to human health .
Our data support the notion that the released/disposed chemical pollutants into water systems make fish a source of environmental toxicants to humans .
The risks and potential effects of PFCs to health of coastal population in the Pearl River Delta are of concern .
