Human scalp hair mercury concentrations were determined in 219 hair samples from male individuals from different regions of Bangladesh .
Total hair mercury concentrations were very low with a mean value of 0.44 +/- 0.19 micrograms Hg/g ( range 0.02-0.95 ) for a moderately elevated fish consumption averaging 2.1 kg/month ( range 1.4-2.6 ) .
A highly significant positive correlation ( r = 0.88 , P < 0.001 ) was found between fish consumption and hair mercury concentration .
Neither age , region nor occupation had any influence on the hair mercury content .
Our results in agreement with literature values , are described by equation ( X = 183Y + 0.16 ) linking calculated daily methylmercury intake ( X , mg ) and hair total mercury level ( Y , micrograms/g ) .
Low concentrations in hair were linked to extremely low levels of daily mercury intake , the determining factor being remarkably low mercury levels in Bangladesh fish .
