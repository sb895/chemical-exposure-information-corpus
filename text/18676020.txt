To evaluate the status of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) contamination in poultry and sequentially human exposure through consumption of poultry in an e-waste recycling site in South China , two kinds of free-range domestic birds , chicken and duck , were collected and their muscle and liver tissues were analyzed for 16 PBDE congeners .
Chicken shows higher PBDE concentrations ( summation of 16 PBDE congeners ) in both muscle and liver tissues , ranged from 5.7 to 4381 and from 1.5 to 7897 ng/g ( lipid weight , the same hereinafter ) , respectively , compared to duck , ranged from 2.4 to 51 and from 1.9 to 134 ng/g .
Different living habitat and feeding habits between the two species might be responsible for this observation .
No sex-related differences in PBDE concentrations were found for the two species , while the PBDE concentrations in muscle were higher than those in liver for chicken .
The PBDE concentrations in muscle of chicken in the present study were higher than the levels of PBDEs in chicken from other studies reported by far .
BDE209 and nona-BDEs were the major congeners in poultry .
Comparison of PBDE profiles between birds and environmental matrix implied that the biodebromination of BDE209 might occur in poultry .
The intake of PBDEs through consumption of poultry ranges from 7.8 ng/day to 3582 ng/day with a medial 68 ng/day , which is comparable to the calculated values through consumption of all foodstuffs in other studies .
The present study suggested that the total dietary PBDEs intake for local residents might be considerably enhanced due to the e-waste recycling activity .
