Mercury is being released in the Amazon in an abusive way due to goldmining activities .
The Tapajós river basin was the first to be intensively exploited in the modern Amazon gold rush .
Fish and hair samples as the best indicators of human methylmercury contamination were investigated in the main cities and villages along the Tapajós river basin .
The upper basin has typical fish fauna with much larger carnivorous fish with higher mercury levels reaching an average value of 0.69 microgram.g-1 wet wt. in 43 fish .
This was accompanied by high levels in hair of the human population living in the same area .
The maximum hair value reach 151 micrograms.g-1 dry wt. with two villages presenting an average value close to 25 micrograms.g-1 dry wt .
An analytical laboratory intercalibration exercise was performed between Japanese and Brazilian laboratories for total mercury analysis .
Critical fish , areas , and more exposed human groups are identified .
