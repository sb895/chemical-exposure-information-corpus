This study concerns the metabolism of inorganic arsenic ( As ) in children in three villages in northern Argentina : San Antonio de los Cobres and Taco Pozo , each with about 200 microg As/l in the drinking water , and Rosario de Lerma , with 0.65 microg As/l .
Findings show that the concentrations of As in the blood and urine of the children in the two As-rich villages were on average 9 and 380 microg/l , respectively , the highest ever recorded for children .
The concentrations were about 10 and 30 times higher for blood and urine , respectively , than in Rosario de Lerma .
Total As in urine was only slightly higher than the sum of metabolites of inorganic As ( U-Asmet ) , i.e. , inorganic As , methylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) ; this shows that inorganic As was the main form of As ingested .
In contrast to previous studies on urinary metabolites of inorganic As in various population groups , the children and women in the present study excreted very little MMA .
Thus , there seems to be a polymorphism for the enzymes ( methyltransferases ) involved in the methylation of As .
Interestingly , the children had a significantly higher percentage of inorganic As in urine than the women , about 50% versus 32% .
Also , the percentage of inorganic As in the children is considerably higher than in previous studies on children ( about 13% in the two studies available ) and adults ( about 15-25% ) in other population groups .
This may indicate that children are more sensitive to As-induced toxicity than adults , as the methylated metabolites bind less to tissue constituents than inorganic As .
In the children , the percentage inorganic arsenic in urine decreased , and the percentage of DMA increased with increasing U-Asmet , indicating an induction of As methylation with increasing exposure .
