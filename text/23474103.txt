Some phthalates are endocrine disruptors and reproductive and developmental toxicants .
Data on newborn phthalate exposure and elimination characteristics are scarce .
We determined 21 urinary phthalate metabolites ( indicating exposure to 11 parent phthalates ) in two study approaches : in the first approach we collected the urine of 20 healthy newborns at days 2-5 post partum together with 47 urine samples of 7 women during pregnancy .
In the second fine tuned approach we collected first urine samples of 9 healthy newborns together with their mother's urine shortly before birth .
To ensure full and contamination free collection of the newborns first urines we used special adhesive urine bags for children .
All urine samples revealed ubiquitous exposures to phthalates comparable to other populations .
Metabolite levels in the newborns first day urine samples were generally lower than in all other samples .
However , the newborns urines ( both first and day 2-5 urines ) showed a metabolite pattern distinctly different from the maternal and general population samples : in the newborns urines the carboxy-metabolites of the long chain phthalates ( DEHP , DiNP , DiDP ) were the by far dominant metabolites with a relative share in the metabolite spectrum up to 6 times higher than in maternal urine .
Oppositely , for the short chain phthalates ( DBP , DiBP ) oxidized metabolites seemed to be less favored than the simple monoesters in the newborns urines .
The skewed metabolite distribution in the newborns urine warrants further investigation in terms of early phthalate metabolism , the quantity of internal phthalate exposure of the fetus/newborn and its possible health effects .
