A random sample of 68 males and 25 females who reside in Mansoura city , Egypt , was examined for concentrations of cadmium , lead , and mercury in blood , urine , hair , and nails .
The effect of gender and smoking on such levels was studied .
The influence of dental amalgam on the levels of mercury in these biological samples was also examined .
The results obtained show that only blood lead , which increased among males , was affected by gender .
Blood levels of cadmium and lead as well as hair lead appeared to increase with smoking habit .
Mercury levels in blood and urine were related to the presence of dental amalgam fillings .
International comparisons between our results and the corresponding levels in other localities in the world showed that there were environmentally related variations in terms of cadmium levels in hair , lead levels in blood , urine , hair , and nails , and mercury levels in blood , hair , and nails .
In conclusion , reference intervals of cadmium , lead , and mercury in the biological samples are environmentally related parameters .
Some factors , such as gender , smoking habit , and the presence of dental amalgam fillings , may affect such levels and therefore should be considered .
