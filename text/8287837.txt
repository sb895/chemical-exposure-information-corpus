The selenium in the diet of persons in arsenic-endemic areas , high levels of arsenic in the drinking water , was evaluated .
The methodology used was that of 24-hr dietary recall .
Daily selenium intakes of two rural towns in northern Mexico were found to be similar , approximating 72.9 and 60.6 micrograms .
These values were similar to those of a previously arsenic-exposed area from California , Edison community .
The Edison participants had a daily selenium intake of 61.8 micrograms .
The possible negative effect of selenium to produce differences in reported geographical variation in disease could not be substantiated in this study .
Other nutrient intakes , protein and energy were also found similar for communities .
Differences were noted in vitamin A intake where one-third the daily requirement was experienced by Mexican participants compared to two-thirds the requirement being satisfied by those participants from Edison .
