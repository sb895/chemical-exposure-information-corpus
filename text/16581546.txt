Associations between concentrations of ambient fine particles [ particulate matter < 2.5 microm aerodynamic diameter ( PM2.5) ] and heart rate variability ( HRV ) have differed by study population .
We examined the effects of ambient pollution on HRV for 18 individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and 12 individuals with recent myocardial infarction ( MI ) living in Atlanta , Georgia .
HRV , baseline pulmonary function , and medication data were collected for each participant on 7 days in fall 1999 and/or spring 2000 .
Hourly ambient pollution concentrations were obtained from monitoring sites in Atlanta .
The association between ambient pollution and HRV was examined using linear mixed-effect models .
Ambient pollution had opposing effects on HRV in our COPD and MI participants , resulting in no significant effect of ambient pollution on HRV in the entire population for 1- , 4- , or 24-hr moving averages .
For individuals with COPD , interquartile range ( IQR ) increases in 4-hr ambient PM2.5 ( 11.65 microg/m3) ) and nitrogen dioxide ( 11.97 ppb ) were associated with 8.3% [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.7-15.3% ] and 7.7% ( 95% CI , 0.1-15.9% ) increase in the SD of normal R-R intervals ( SDNN ) , respectively .
For individuals with MI , IQR increases in 4-hr PM2.5 ( 8.54 microg/m3 ) and NO2 ( 9.25 ppb ) were associated with a nonsignificant 2.9% ( 95% CI , -7.8 to 2.3 ) and significant 12.1 ( 95% CI , -19.5 to -4.0 ) decrease in SDNN .
Beta-blocker and bronchodilator intake and baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 sec modified the PM-SDNN association significantly , with effects consistent with those by disease group .
Results indicate heterogeneity in the autonomic response to air pollution due to differences in baseline health , with significant associations for ambient NO2 suggesting an important role for traffic-related pollution .
