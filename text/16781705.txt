Peritoneal endometriosis ( PE ) and deep endometriotic nodules ( DEN ) are gynecological diseases recently shown to be associated with elevated serum concentrations of organochlorines .
The objective of the present study was to compare risk factors associated with both forms of the disease , with a particular attention to potential sources of organochlorine exposure .
This matched case-control study with prospective recruitment included 88 triads ( PE-DEN-control ) .
All women were face-to-face interviewed with a standardized questionnaire , and serum dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyl measurements were available for 58 of them .
Alcohol consumption ( odds ratio ( OR ) : 5.82 [ confidence interval at 95% ( 95%CI ) 1.20-28.3] ) in DEN and low physical activity at work for DEN ( OR : 4.58 [ 95%CI 1.80-11.62] ) and PE ( OR : 5.61 [ 95%CI 1.90-16.60] ) were traced as significant risk factors .
Organochlorine-related factors ( use of tampons , occupational or environmental exposure ) were not related to the disease .
The current consumption of foodstuffs that were more likely to contribute to organochlorine body burden did not differ among the groups .
Only some of these fatty foodstuffs ( marine fish , pig meat ) were traced by multiple regression analysis as significant determinants of organochlorine body burden , explaining only a small fraction ( 20% ) of the interindividual variation of organochlorine body burden .
We conclude that PE and DEN share similar patterns of risk or protective factors .
