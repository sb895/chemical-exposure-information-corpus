The fluoride content in infusions of commercially available black , green , oolong , pu-erh and white teas was determined by ion-selective electrode .
Herbal infusions as well as instant tea and ready-to-drink tea beverages were also examined .
It is found that brewing time ( 5 , 10 and 30 min ) does increase the fluoride content , which in infusions of black tea ( 5 min brewing ) was higher than that in the other types of tea , with contents ranging between 0.32 and 4.54 mg/l for black tea to 0.37-0.54 mg/l for white tea and with even lower values for herbal tea infusions of 0.02-0.09 mg/l .
On the basis of the results obtained , the daily intake of fluoride provided from tea and herbal beverages was estimated for an adult person and for children in comparison with the Polish SAI ( Safe and Adequate Daily Intake ) of fluoride which is strictly attributable to ADI ( Acceptable Daily Intake ) .
The fluoride intake resulted from the regular consumption of black tea infusions was raised as compared to the other types of teas as well as herbal teas .
For adult and children tea drinkers consuming five cups of black tea per day the intake of fluoride will be in the range of 8.0-303% and 12-303% of the SAI , respectively .
People are often exposed to multiple sources of fluoride , such as in food , water , air and excessive use of toothpaste .
The control of tea quality is important to protect human against too high uptake of this element from black tea , which is the most popular beverage .
Excessive intake of fluoride with black tea , especially in the regions with its high level in the drinking water , increases the risk of dental fluorosis in children during the years of tooth development .
The long-term exposure to large amounts of fluoride can lead to potentially skeletal fluorosis ( WHO , 1984 ) .
