DNA adducts derived from complex mixtures of polycyclic aromatic compounds emitted from tobacco smoke are compared to industrial pollution sources ( e.g. , coke ovens and aluminum smelters ) , smoky coal burning , and urban air pollution .
Exposures to coke oven emissions and smoky coal , both potent rodent skin tumor initiators and lung carcinogens in humans , result in high levels of DNA adducts compared to tobacco smoke in the in vitro calf thymus DNA model system , in cultured lymphocytes , and in the mouse skin assay .
Using tobacco smoke as a model in human studies , we have compared relative DNA adduct levels detected in blood lymphocytes , placental tissue , bronchoalveolar lung lavage cells , sperm , and autopsy tissues of smokers and nonsmokers .
Adduct levels in DNA isolated from smokers were highest in human heart and lung tissue with smaller but detectable differences in placental tissue and lung lavage cells .
Comparison of the DNA adduct levels resulting from human exposure to different complex mixtures shows that emissions from coke ovens , aluminum smelters , and smoky coal result in higher DNA adduct levels than tobacco smoke exposure .
These studies suggest that humans exposed to complex combustion mixtures will have higher DNA adduct levels in target cells ( e.g. , lung ) as compared to nontarget cells ( e.g. , lymphocytes ) and that the adduct levels will be dependent on the genotoxic and DNA adduct-forming potency of the mixture .
