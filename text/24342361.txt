The aim of present study was to simultaneously estimate the arsenic ( As ) and fluoride ( F(-) ) concentrations in irrigated surface water , soil and grain crops of Nagarparkar , Pakistan during 2010-2012 .
The As and F(-) were analyzed by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometer and ion selective electrode , respectively .
Total arsenic ( AsT ) and F(-) in irrigated surface water samples were found in the range of 360-683\u03bcgL(-1) and 18.5-35.4mgL(-1) , respectively .
While AsT and F(-) concentrations in agriculture soil samples were observed in the range of 110-266 and 125-566mgkg(-1) , respectively .
The water extractable As and F(-) were found 3-4% of total concentration of these in soils .
The AsT concentration was higher in kidney been ( KB ) as compared to pearl millet ( PM ) and green gram ( GG ) , whereas GG had higher F(-) levels as compared to other two grain crops ( p<0.05 ) .
The KB samples grown in nine sites shows BCF of As in the range of 0.018-0.038 .
The GG has higher BCF of F(-) as compared to KB and PM ( p<0.05 ) grown in all sites .
The exposure dose and risk factor of As and F(-) were obtained by estimated daily intake ( EDI ) and hazardous index ( HI ) .
It was found that all understudy age groups were at the severe risk of arsenicosis and fluorosis , but the severity is higher in younger age group ( 7-15years ) as compared to elder groups ( p<0.05 ) .
