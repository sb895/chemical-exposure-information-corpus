An association between autism and early life exposure to mercury is a hotly debated issue .
In this study , 91 autistic Polish children , male and female , 3-4 and 7-9 years old , were compared to 75 age- and sex-matched healthy children with respect to : demographic , perinatal , clinical and developmental measures , parental age , birth order , morphometric measures , vaccination history , and hair mercury content .
In demographic and perinatal measures there were no consistent differences between the autistic and control groups .
Autistic children had a significantly greater prevalence of adverse reactions after vaccinations and abnormal development than controls .
Between 45 and 80% of autistic children experienced developmental regress .
Autistic children significantly differed from healthy peers in the concentrations of mercury in hair : younger autistics had lower levels , while older - higher levels than their respective controls .
The results suggest that autistic children differ from healthy children in metabolism of mercury , which seems to change with age .
