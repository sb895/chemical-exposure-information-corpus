Food consumption is one of the key exposure routes of humans to contaminants .
This article evaluated the residue levels of 51 pesticides and 16 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in selected fish and food items which were commonly consumed in the Nantong area of Jiangsu Province , Southeast China .
The 51 pesticides and 16 PCBs were analyzed by highly sensitive gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( GC-MS/MS ) .
The results showed that organochlorine pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes ( DDTs ) , hexachlorocyclohexanes ( HCHs ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) and mirex and other pesticides including chlorpyrifos , pyrethroid pesticides , metolachlor , pyridaben and trifluralin were frequently detected in the samples , which was consistent with the accumulation level and characteristics of these toxic chemicals in human adipose tissue of people living in Nantong .
Meanwhile , correlation of the residue level of toxic chemicals with their physical chemical properties and historic use pattern in Nantong area was observed .
Combined with dietary survey results at the same sampling locations , human health risk assessment of ingestion through the dietary route was performed .
The results suggested that the non-cancer risks of the chemicals investigated can be considered negligible in the Nantong area , however , the cancer risks from lifetime dietary exposure to DDTs and HCB have exceeded the acceptable levels .
