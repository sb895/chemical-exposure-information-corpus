Fourteen PBDE congeners from mono- to deca-BDE were determined in breast milk of primiparous mothers from two locations in East China , i.e .
Nanjing ( n=9 ) , an urban area , and Zhoushan ( n=10 ) , a semi rural coastal area .
PBDEs were detected in all the human breast milk samples of the present study , indicating that general population in these two locations are widely exposed to these pollutants .
Relatively higher concentrations of PBDEs were found in the milk of mothers from Nanjing than Zhoushan , suggesting the existence of significant sources of PBDEs in urban areas .
PBDE levels in the present study were similar to those in European countries , but one or two orders of magnitude lower than in North America .
Except for BDE-3 , all congeners from di- to deca-BDE were detected in the samples of the present study .
BDE-209 , a congener considered to have less bioavailability , was detected in about 50% of the samples at concentrations higher than that of other congeners .
Other higher brominated congeners , such as BDE-153 , -197 and -207 , were also prominent in the present study , which is different from the pattern generally observed in previous studies on human milk as well as biota samples .
These results may indicate that the inhabitants of Nanjing and Zhoushan are exposed to location specific sources of PBDEs .
