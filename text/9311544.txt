A cross-sectional study was conducted in 35 male subjects randomly selected from workers of a ferroalloy production plant and exposed to manganese ( Mn ) oxides ; the objective was to detect early signs of neurologic impairment .
The subjects ' mean age was 39.4 years ( SD , 8. 4 ) ; the average exposure duration was 14.5 years ( range , 5-29 years ) .
A control group of industrial workers not exposed to neurotoxic chemicals and comparable in age and confounding factors was recruited .
The intensity of Mn exposure was moderate , as reflected by airborne Mn concentrations in total dust averaging 193 [ corrected ] micro g/m3 .
Mn levels in blood ( MnB ) and urine ( MnU ) were significantly higher in the Mn-exposed workers than in control workers .
A relationship ( not found with MnU ) was found between MnB and a cumulative exposure index calculated on the basis of air concentration and exposure history for each subject ( r = 0.52 ; r2 = 0.27 ; P = 0.002 ) .
Psychomotor function scores were lower among Mn-exposed subjects .
The Aiming score was negatively correlated with MnB in the exposed group .
The olfactory threshold did not differ between the two groups , although it was negatively associated with MnU in the exposed group .
The white blood cell count results were significantly higher in Mn-exposed subjects than in controls .
These findings show that an increase in Mn body burden is associated with an impairment of motor functions , whereas the increased excretion of Mn is related to an increased olfactory perception .
Changes in numbers of leukocytes could indicate possible interferences of Mn with the immunological system .
