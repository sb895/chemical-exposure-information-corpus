Recently , elevated dioxin levels , over 5 parts per trillion ( ppt ) 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) , from Agent Orange was reported in 95% of 43 selected residents of Bien Hoa City , a city in southern Vietnam near a former air base used for Agent Orange-spraying missions .
Agent Orange herbicide , contaminated with TCDD , was sprayed in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971 primarily for use as a defoliant .
Typical blood TCCD levels are 2 ppt in Vietnamese , but levels are as high as 413 ppt in Bien Hoa City .
Elevated TCDD was found in children born many years after Agent Orange spraying ended and in immigrants from non-Agent Orange-sprayed parts of Vietnam , which documented new exposures .
Extremely elevated soil TCDD samples , over 1 million ppt , and elevated TCDD in sediment were found in some nearby areas such as Bien Hung Lake .
The primary route of intake of almost all dioxins in humans is food .
However , in our prior studies in Bien Hoa , food was unavailable for dioxin analysis so the route of intake was not confirmed .
In the 1970s , while Agent Orange was still being sprayed , elevated human milk TCDD levels as high as 1850 were detected in milk from Vietnamese people living in Agent Orange-sprayed areas where consumption of fish was high .
Furthermore , also in the 1970s , elevated TCDD levels ( up to 810 ppt ) were found in fish and shrimp from the same area as the milk donors .
In the 1980s , we found elevated TCDD and also other organohalogen levels in human tissue , pork , fish , a turtle , and a snake in Southern Vietnam .
For these reasons , we recently collected food from Bien Hoa and analyzed it for dioxins , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , DDT and its metabolites , and other organochlorines .
We found marked elevation of TCDD , the dioxin characteristic of Agent Orange , in some of the food products , including ducks with 276 ppt and 331 ppt wet weight , chickens from 0.031-15 ppt wet weight , fish from 0.063-65 ppt wet weight , and a toad with 56 ppt wet weight .
Usual TCDD levels in food are less than 0.1 ppt .
Total TEQ for ducks was from 286-343 ppt wet weight or 536 ppt and 550 ppt lipid ; for chickens from 0.35-48 ppt wet weight or 0.95-74 ppt lipid , for fish from 0.19-66 ppt wet weight or 3.2 ppt and 15,349 ppt lipid , and the toad was 80 ppt wet weight and 11,765 ppt lipid .
Interestingly , this study did not find elevated levels of TCDD in the pork and beef samples .
Clearly , food , including duck , chicken , some fish , and a toad , appears responsible for elevated TCDD in residents of Bien Hoa City , even though the original Agent Orange contamination occurred 30-40 years before sampling .
Elevated levels of PCBs and DDT and its metabolites were found in some food samples .
Furthermore , measurable levels of hexachlorocyclohexanes ( HCH ) and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) were found in a wide range of measurable levels .
All of the 11 dioxin-like PCBs measured and presented plus 6 dioxins in addition to TCDD and 10 dibenzofurans contributed to the total dioxin toxicity ( TEQ ) .
However , when elevated , TCDD frequently contributed most of the TEQ .
Thirty-six congeners from 7 classes of chemicals were measured in each of the 16 specimens providing a total of 576 congener levels .
