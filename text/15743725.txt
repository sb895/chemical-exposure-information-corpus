Chronic arsenic exposure causes vascular diseases associated with systematic dysfunction of endogenous nitric oxide .
Replacement of heavily arsenic-contaminated drinking water with low-arsenic water is a potential intervention strategy for arsenosis , although the reversibility of arsenic intoxication has not established .
In the present study , we examined urinary excretion of cyclic guanosine 3 ,5 -monophosphate ( cGMP ) , a second messenger of the vasoactive effects of nitric oxide , and signs and symptoms for peripheral vascular function in 54 arsenosis patients before and after they were supplied with low-arsenic drinking water in an endemic area of chronic arsenic poisoning in Inner Mongolia , China .
The arsenosis patients showed a marked decrease in urinary excretion of cGMP ( mean +/- SEM : male , 37.0 +/- 6.1 ; female , 37.2 +/- 5.4 nmol/mmol creatinine ) , and a 13-month period of consuming low-arsenic drinking water reversed this trend ( male , 68.0 +/- 5.6 ; female , 70.6 +/- 3.0 nmol/mmol creatinine ) and improved peripheral vascular response to cold stress .
Our intervention study indicates that peripheral vascular disease in arsenosis patients can be reversed by exposure cessation and has important implications for the public health approach to arsenic exposure .
