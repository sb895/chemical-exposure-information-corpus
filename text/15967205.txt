The hepatotoxic effect of arsenic when used in therapeutic dose has long been recognized .
We described the nature and degree of liver involvement and its pathogenesis due to prolonged drinking of arsenic-contaminated water in West Bengal , India .
From hospital-based studies on 248 cases of arsenicosis , hepatomegaly was found in 190 patients ( 76.6% ) .
Non cirrhotic portal fibrosis was the predominant lesions in 63 out of 69 cases who underwent liver biopsy .
The portal fibrosis was characterized by expansion of portal zones with streaky fibrosis , a few of which contained leash of vessels .
However , portal hypertension was found in smaller number of cases .
A cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out on 7683 people residing in arsenic-affected districts of West Bengal .
Out of these , 3467 and 4216 people consumed water-containing arsenic below and above 0.05 mg/l , respectively .
Prevalence of hepatomegaly was significantly higher in arsenic-exposed people ( 10.2% ) compared to controls ( 2.99% , P < 0.001 ) .
The incidence of hepatomegaly was found to have a linear relationship proportionate to increasing exposure of arsenic in drinking water in both sexes ( P < 0.001 ) .
In an experimental study , BALB/C mice were given water contaminated with arsenic ( 3.2 mg/l ) ad libitum for 15 months , the animals being sacrificed at 3-month intervals .
We observed progressive reduction of hepatic glutathione and enzymes of anti-oxidative defense system associated with lipid peroxidation .
Liver histology showed fatty infiltration at 12 months and hepatic fibrosis at 15 months .
Our studies show that prolong drinking of arsenic-contaminated water is associated with hepatomegaly .
Predominant lesion of hepatic fibrosis appears to be caused by arsenic induced oxystress .
