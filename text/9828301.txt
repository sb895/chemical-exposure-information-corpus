PCDD/PCDF/PCB concentrations were measured in samples from four mothers ( at delivery and during lactation ) and their infants ( at birth and the end of first year of life ) .
For two of these mothers it was the second delivery and breast-feeding period , and additional data were available from first lactation period and the first-born infant at the age of 11 to 12 months .
Five of the six infants were fully breast-fed for at least 17 weeks .
In four of them a distinct PCDD/PCDF/PCB accumulation was observed at the end of the first year of life : concentrations in blood fat were 1.5 to 3.6 times higher than maternal levels measured at the same time .
Due to decreasing maternal body burdens during lactation , PCDD/PCDF concentrations at 11 to 12 months of life were only about half as high in the second infant as in the first one at the same age .
During second pregnancy , no important change of the concentrations was observed in maternal blood .
