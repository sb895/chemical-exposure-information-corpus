Mal de Meleda ( MDM ) is a rare autosomal recessively inherited palmoplantar keratoderma .
In 1826 Stulli described the disease on the Dalmatian island of Meleda .
Hyperkeratosis involves other parts of the body such as elbows and knees , in addition to the palms and soles .
Zinc deficiency is known to cause hyperkeratozis in addition to other skin changes .
We studied the levels of essential and nonessential elements in blood and tissues /nail , hair , skin/ in MDM patients and healthy controls living in Köprüçay area , Turkey .
The results show no significant difference in blood zinc , iron , copper , cadmium , and lead levels between MDM patients and healthy controls .
The zinc and copper levels of nail and hair in MDM patients did not differ from those of healthy controls .
