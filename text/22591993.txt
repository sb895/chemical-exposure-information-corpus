BACKGROUND On December 7th , 2007 , the Hong Kong tanker Hebei Spirit ( HS ) ( 146,848 tons ) was crushed by a crane ship near the shore of Taean , Korea .
More than 12,547 kl of crude oil spilled into the sea and contaminated the western coastline of the Korean peninsula .
For a period of six months after the accident , approximately 1,000,000 volunteers participated in the cleanup .
Our goal in this study was to examine the exposure status and acute health effects on volunteers that participated in the oil spill cleanup .
METHODS A survey questionnaire was filled out by 565 volunteers , requesting information regarding physical symptoms .
Out of the total number of participants , urine samples from 105 university student volunteers were collected before and after the cleanup work , and metabolite levels of volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were analyzed .
RESULTS Volunteers that participated for longer cleanup work reported an increase in physical symptoms including visual disturbance , nasal and bronchus irritation , headaches , heart palpitations , fatigue and fever , memory and cognitive disturbance , and abdominal pain .
The levels of t,t-muconic acid , mandelic acid , and 1-hydroxypyrene were significantly higher in samples after cleanup than those measured before participation ( p<0.05 ) .
Other than the associated risk of dermal irritation with the difference in the t,t-muconic acid level between the post- to pre-cleanup levels , no other physical symptoms demonstrated a significant association with changes observed in the levels of urinary metabolites .
CONCLUSIONS Based on the significant increase of subjective symptoms in volunteers participating in the study , monitoring of the long term health effects , focusing on those with longer exposure , is warranted .
