A 1995 pilot study assessed sport fish consumption and contaminant exposure among Montreal-area residents fishing the frozen St. Lawrence River .
Interviews conducted among 223 ice fishers met on-site were used to create an index of estimated exposure to fish-borne contaminants .
A second-stage assessment of sport fish consumption and tissue contaminant burdens included 25 interviewees at the highest level of estimated contaminant exposure ( of 38 , or 66% of those solicited ) and 15 low-exposure fishers ( of 41 , or 37% of those solicited ) .
High-level fisher-consumers reported eating 0. 92+/-0.99 sport fish meals/week during the previous 3 weeks compared to 0.38+/-0.21 ( P<0.05 ) for the low-level group .
Based on the product of consumption frequency times mass of sport fish meals consumed , high-level consumers ate a mean of 18.3 kg of sport fish annually versus 3.3 kg for the low-level consumers .
Tissue contaminant assessments showed significant ( P<0.05 ) groupwise differences : 0-1 cm hair mercury ( median 0.73 microgram/g for the high versus 0.23 microgram/g for the low group ) , lipid-adjusted plasma PCB congeners ( Aroclor 1260 : median 0.77 microgram/g versus 0.47 microgram/g ) , and lipid-adjusted plasma DDE ( median 0.35 microgram/g versus 0.26 microgram/g ) .
No participant had a hair mercury or plasma DDE concentration above Health Canada recommendations but 2/25 high-level participants ( 8% ) had plasma Aroclor 1260 concentrations above recommended limits .
The results of this pilot study suggest that a small number of Montreal-area sportfishers consume their catch as often as three times weekly and that those consuming sport fish frequently have significantly higher tissue levels of mercury , PCBs , and DDE than do infrequent consumers .
On the other hand , compared to other groups in Quebec , such as the Inuit or commercial fishers on the North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence , Montreal-area sportfishers eat less fish and have lower tissue concentrations of fish-related contaminants .
