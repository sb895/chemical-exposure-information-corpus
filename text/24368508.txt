Consumption of arsenic-contaminated drinking water is associated with increased cancer risk .
The relationship between arsenic body burden , such as concentrations in human toenails , and arsenic in drinking water is not fully understood .
We evaluated the relationship between arsenic concentrations in drinking water and toenail clippings among a cohort of Nova Scotians .
A total of 960 men and women aged 35 to 69 years provided home drinking water and toenail clipping samples .
Information on water source and treatment use and covariables was collected through questionnaires .
Arsenic concentrations in drinking water and toenail clippings and anthropometric indices were measured .
Private drilled water wells had higher arsenic concentrations compared with other dug wells and municipal drinking water sources ( P<0.001 ) .
Among participants with drinking water arsenic levels \u22651\u2009\u03bcg/l , there was a significant relationship between drinking water and toenail arsenic concentrations ( r=0.46 , P<0.0001 ) .
Given similar levels of arsenic exposure from drinking water , obese individuals had significantly lower concentrations of arsenic in toenails compared with those with a normal weight .
Private drilled water wells were an important source of arsenic exposure in the study population .
Body weight modifies the relationship between drinking water arsenic exposure and toenail arsenic concentrations .
