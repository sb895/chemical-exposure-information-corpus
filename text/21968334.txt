Human biomonitoring is a well-recognized tool for estimating the exposure of human populations to environmental pollutants .
However , information regarding biomarker concentrations of many environmental chemicals in the general population is limited for many countries .
The Spanish Environment Ministry has recently funded a human biomonitoring study on the Spanish general population .
This study aims to determine reference levels for several biomarkers , especially heavy metals , persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) and cotinine , in urine , whole blood , serum and hair , and will involve 2000 volunteers throughout Spain .
Samples were taken during 2009-2010 and analyses are currently underway .
The results presented herein were obtained in a pilot study carried out in the Madrid region .
The study group comprised 170 volunteers , of which 79% were female and 21% male ( age : 23-66 years ) .
All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding diet and living habits and provides a morning urine sample .
The geometric means for total mercury ( Hg ) , lead ( Pb ) and cadmium ( Cd ) were 1.23 , 1.11 and 0.25 \u03bcg/g creatinine , respectively .
Levels of Pb and Hg were higher than those reported for the general population in the USA and Germany , whereas Cd was in the same range ( CDC , 2009 ; Becker et al. , 2003 ) .
The values reported here are similar to those reported in other Spanish studies .
