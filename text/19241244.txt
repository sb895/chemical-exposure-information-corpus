We introduced flocculant-disinfectant water treatment for 12 weeks in 103 households in Bangladesh to assess if drinking water would be chemically and microbiologically improved and the body burden of arsenic reduced .
The median concentration of arsenic in tubewell water decreased by 88% after introduction of the flocculant-disinfectant from 136 microg/l at baseline to 16 ( p < 0.001 ) .
The median concentration of total urinary arsenic decreased 42% from 385 microg/g creatinine at baseline to 225 microg/g creatinine after intervention ( p < 0.001 ) .
Among 206 post-intervention drinking water samples that were reportedly treated on the date the sample was collected , 99 ( 48% ) lacked residual free chlorine and 100 ( 49% ) were contaminated with thermotolerant coliforms .
The flocculant-disinfectant markedly reduced arsenic in drinking water , but treated drinking water was frequently contaminated with fecal organisms .
The lesser reduction in urinary arsenic compared to water arsenic and the health consequences of this reduction require further research .
