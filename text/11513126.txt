Organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were analysed in extracts of human adipose tissue .
The samples consisted of abdominal , mammary , and perirenal fat tissue of 27 Finnish adult males and females .
Lipids were separated from the low-molecular compounds by preparative gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) and the extracts were further cleaned-up using Florisil chromatography .
The compounds were analysed in the extracts by gas chromatography ( GC ) using electron capture detection and by GC-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode .
Of the 23 analysed pesticide residues only seven could be detected in the extracts .
All the extracts contained the DDT metabolite 4,4'-DDE , hexachlorobenzene , and PCBs .
Other compounds found in the extracts were 4,4'-DDT , 4,4'-DDD , pentachlorobenzene , and beta- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) .
The antiandrogenic 4,4'-DDE was the most abundant pesticide with concentration levels ranging from 3.5 to 3229 ng/g lipids ( ppb ) .
The mean concentration of DDE was 567 ppb , of pesticides in all 1008 ppb and of PCBs 504 ppb .
Several of the identified compounds have been shown to exhibit endocrine disrupting effects .
Statistical analysis showed a positive age correlation of DDE in females and hexachlorobenzene in males .
No statistically significant differences were found for concentrations of individual compounds between sexes .
