The estrogenic effects of bisphenol A ( BPA ) have been reported in human cells ( E-screen assays ) and in ( italic)in vivo(/italic) studies of rodents , although the latter reports remain controversial , as do the exposure levels and adverse health effects of BPA in humans .
In this study we report on an analytical high-performance liquid chromatography/fluorescence method for BPA and its conjugate in human urine and on the application of this method in two student cohorts .
Urine , along with information on smoking , alcohol intake , and coffee/tea consumption , was collected in two different years from two different groups of university students , 50 in 1992 and 56 in 1999 .
Overall , the urinary BPA levels in the students in 1992 were significantly higher than were those in 1999 .
The BPA levels were also positively correlated with coffee and tea consumption in the 1992 cohort but not in the 1999 cohort .
We speculate that recent changes made in Japan regarding the interior coating of cans used to package these beverages may partly explain these findings .
