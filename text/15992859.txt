The fisheries products in this study comprise fish , bivalve , crustacean and cephalopod collected from different types of markets in Taiwan between the years 2001 and 2003 .
A total of 91 pesticide residues belonging to four major pesticide groups were tested and analyzed .
The test results show that 65.40% of fish , 93.55% of shellfish , 84.92% of crustacean and 98.33% of cephalopod samples contain no detectable residues .
There are only two kinds ( organochlorine and organophosphate ) of totally six pesticides ( DDTs , dieldrin , chlorpyrifos , fenitrotion , fenthion and prothion ) that have been detected from the fisheries products in this study .
For there were pesticides present in the fish products , consumption of fisheries product there was no zero risk .
But the exposure of consumer did not exceed the acceptable daily intakes ( ADI ) .
For male , there was the highest risk in exposure to dieldrin , which the percentage of ADI was 93.56% .
This study also suggests that a yearly monitoring program for organophosphate pesticide residues in fish is necessity .
